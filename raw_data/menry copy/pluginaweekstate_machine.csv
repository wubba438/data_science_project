Moved StateExtension class into a separate file in order to help keep the has_state files clean.
Renamed InvalidState and InvalidEvent exceptions to StateNotFound and EventNotFound in order to follow the ActiveRecord convention (i.e. RecordNotFound).
Added StateNotActive and EventNotActive exceptions to help differentiate between states which don't exist and states which weren't defined in the class.
Added support for defining callbacks like so:
  def before_exit_parked
  end
  
  def after_enter_idling
  end
Added support for defining callbacks using class methods:
  before_exit_parked :fasten_seatbelt
Added event callbacks after the transition has occurred (e.g. after_park)
State callbacks no longer receive any of the arguments that were provided in the event action
Updated license to include our names."
