Can't use invalidate_step() as that invalidates the perimeters as well.

* Add a test step to check for regression #4620 - behavior on running Print::process() again on the same model.

* Fix naming scheme for macos/osx builds to make it obvious if it is a PR or not.

* Remove previous versions of the same kind of branch or PR ID

* Adjust copied statements to account for different calling conventions; osx does not have an arch name argument for make_dmg

* Remember to set the version too

* Update windows build server command to clean up old branch builds.

* Specifically look for PR${PR_ID} instead of just ${PR_ID} to avoid unintentional deletions.

* don't symlink pull requests

* Update to call more functions on osx

* Only delete/clean once, not once per file uploaded."

The Clipper library has difficulties processing overlapping polygons.
Namely, the function Clipper::JoinCommonEdges() has potentially a terrible time complexity if the output
of the operation is of the PolyTree type.
This function implmenets a following workaround:
1) Peform the Clipper operation with the output to Paths. This method handles overlaps in a reasonable time.
2) Run Clipper Union once again to extract the PolyTree from the result of 1).

of virtual inheritance. Note that an invocation of ConfigBase::optptr()
is routed to FullPrintConfig::optptr() for all classes of the FullPrintConfig
hierarchy. FullPrintConfig::optptr() in turn invokes optptr()
of PrintObjectConfig, PrintRegionConfig, PrintConfig and HostConfig.
Due to the use of virtual inheritance, this all happens, when
PrintObjectConfig gets constructed as part of FullPrintConfig, but
at that time PrintRegionConfig, PrintConfig and HostConfig are not
constructed yet. Accessing them at that time leads to crashes,
when compiled with Visual Studio 2013 compiler. For some reason
the code generated by gcc does not crash, but I believe the behavior
is undefined and it is better to be fixed anyway.

The patch solves the problem by calling set_defaults() by the topmost
object, which not only fixes the crashes, but also avoids repeated
initialization.

of virtual inheritance. Note that an invocation of ConfigBase::optptr()
is routed to FullPrintConfig::optptr() for all classes of the FullPrintConfig
hierarchy. FullPrintConfig::optptr() in turn invokes optptr()
of PrintObjectConfig, PrintRegionConfig, PrintConfig and HostConfig.
Due to the use of virtual inheritance, this all happens, when
PrintObjectConfig gets constructed as part of FullPrintConfig, but
at that time PrintRegionConfig, PrintConfig and HostConfig are not
constructed yet. Accessing them at that time leads to crashes,
when compiled with Visual Studio 2013 compiler. For some reason
the code generated by gcc does not crash, but I believe the behavior
is undefined and it is better to be fixed anyway.

The patch solves the problem by calling set_defaults() by the topmost
object, which not only fixes the crashes, but also avoids repeated
initialization."

Type handling is mainly done using templates.
Template Slic3r::ClassTraits is used to store info about exported types (perl class name). Currently only perl class name and refference name is used.
Template values are initialized by REGISTER_CLASS macro. This macro is used in .cpp file of class ( it needs to be used exactly for each type).

Ref<type> class is used to return value as perl reference. Operator overloading is used to make c++ and XSpp happy, only pointer value should be possible to return.

Clone<type> class is used to return copy of value ( using new and copy constructor). Copy is created on assigment, this should be probably improved (memory leak on multiple assignments).
It is overloaded to be able to return type, type* and type&.

Typechecking in ExtrusionEntityCollection updated to check all passed types."

* Added link to website for updates
* Moved 'Slice…' button to the right as this more logically follows the
user's flow through the application
* Moved version information to the middle right under the App name (on
OS X anyway) as it is clearer what the version is referring to
* Added spacing between the buttons
* Removed colon after 'version' as this is the UI convention in about
boxes
* Changed 'Load' to 'Open' as this is the more commonly used term
* Truncated 'Configuration' to 'Config' to save space, and I believe it
is still clear what it means
* Added open and save config to File menu as this is more conventional
location
* Simplified some wording
* Rephrased the tabs to be more succinct, I believe they still make
sense
* Fixed a spelling
