Ruby's `require_relative` [converts paths to absolute paths][1] before
calling `require`. This conversion effectively means that you can pass
an absolute path to `require_relative` and have it load the file
correctly, as if it were a relative path.

This is an idiosyncrasy of Ruby that doesn't match the semantics of the
method. However, some libraries, like [grpc][2], rely on the
idiosyncrasy to load files. Because Derailed's implementation doesn't
conform to this idiosyncrasy, it is unable to work when such libraries
exist in a project.

This change makes Derailed's implementation of `require_relative` behave
more closely to the implementation in Ruby. By making this change, you
can use Derailed with any offending gem.

By default perf:library will not stop when it detects 10 runs that are
statistically significant. This provides an average that is not as
accurate, but decreases the time to run a benchmark from 60+ minutes per
run to as little as 3 minutes and results are roughly comparable. This
setting can also be tuned so that all benchmark iterations are forced to
run.

In addition, one SHA can be specified instead of 2. When this is
provided then derailed will assume you want this SHA run against the
most recent commit present. This could be useful if you are trying out
different changes on a branch and want to always compare the same
baseline to the latest commit in your branch."

There were some problems to the old formatting of the library comparison
output. The x faster and % faster were confusing because it wasn't clear
how they were derived. Also it was not clear which commit SHA belonged
to which values.

In this updated value we give the formulas for the values that are being
shown as well. The latest commit is always first and the value will show
either SLOWER or FASTER based on actual values. Finally we're including
the git first line description to make it clearer which commit is which.

When you're trying to submit a performance patch to rails/rails then they'll likely ask you for a benchmark. While you can sometimes provide a microbenchmark, a real world full stack request/response test is the gold standard. 

That's what this section is about. You'll need a rails app, ideally one you can open source (see [example apps](http://codetriage.com/example_app) if you need inspiration for extracting your private code into something external).

Then you'll need to fork rails and make a branch. Then point your rails app to your branch in your gemfile

```
gem 'rails', github: ""<github username>/rails"", branch: ""<your branch name>""
```

Now you can specify two different commits to test against. Derailed will cycle betwen them, hitting each with 1000 requests. It will record the time it takes to do this 100 times. It uses the different times from the different runs to generate a [student's T test]() which will tell you if the outcome is likely the result of your change or if it's statistical noise. This is important, because moving the needle on the request/response cycle is very difficult, and a performance improvement of 1.01x or 1% faster can be of value, but you have to make sure such a small change isn't the result of noise.

To run your test:

```
$ BRANCHES_TO_TEST=""7b4d80cb373e,13d6aa3a7b70"" bundle exec derailed exec perf:library_branches
```

> Use a comma to seperate your branch names

Derailed will automatically find where you've installed Rails and switch between the branches for you between the tests.

These tests take a along time to run so the output is stored on disk incase you want to see them in the future, they're at `tmp/library_branches/<timestamp>` and labeled with the same names as your branches.

Before running tests you should close all programs on your laptop, turn on a program to prevent your laptop from going to sleep (or increase your sleep timer). Make sure it's plugged into a power outlet and  go grab a cup of coffee. If you do anything on your laptop while this test is running you risk the chance of skewing your results.

When the test is done it will output which commit ""won"" and by how much:

```
Test ""7b4d80cb373e"" is faster than ""13d6aa3a7b70"" by
  1.0062x faster or 0.6131% faster

P-value: 3.733653842080382e-05
Is signifigant? (P-value < 0.05): true
```

You can provide this to the Rails team along with the example app you used to benchmark (so they can independently verify if needed).

Generally performance patches have to be weighted in terms of how much they help versus how large/difficult/gnarly the patch is. If the above example was a really tiny patch and it was in a common component, then half a percent might be a justafiable increase. If it was a huge re-write then it's likely going to be closed. In general I tend to not submit patches unless I'm seeing `>= 1%` performance increases.

You can use this to test changes in other libraries that aren't rails, you just have to tell it the path to the library you want to test against with the `DERAILED_PATH_TO_LIBRARY` env var."

Kernel.require_relative is actually defined in the load.c file of ruby's

the caller's absolute filepath from that, and then runs the same

right above the `require_relative` link from above).

Because we add another layer into the stack when monkey patching
`require_relative`, this doesn't work properly, and it tries to find the
file in the directory that require_relative was monkey patched from, not
from caller of `require_relative`.

The fix for this the monkey patching of `require_relative` was to call
into the monkey patched `require` defined above it, and pass it the
absolute path of the file based on the caller's absolute_path.  This is
similar to the C implementation, but does have the negative side effect
of probably not being as fast as it's C counter part, but I think that
this will be fine, as we are measuring memory, not boot time."

There is a code in rails in DeprecationProxy that undef methods of
deprecated object, constant, etc. But in our case we were making
""require"" public so it was undefined and it was leading to a crash.

When testing with a system that uses jit is often times desirable to “warm up” the code to test that optimizations applied after jit has run are faster.

This PR allows an app to be called X times before being measured by supplying the environment variable `WARM_COUNT` with any number greater than 0. For example `WARM_COUNT=5000` will hit the app 5000 times before measurements are started. 

Default warm up is 0 so original behavior is preserved."

[CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) is an app I have maintained
for the past 4-5 years with the goal of getting people involved in
Open Source projects like this one. The app sends subscribers a random
open issue for them to help ""triage"". For some languages you can also
suggested areas to add documentation.

The initial approach was inspired by seeing the work of the small
core team spending countless hours asking ""what version was
this in"" and ""can you give us an example app"". The idea is to
outsource these small interactions to a huge team of volunteers
and let the core team focus on their work.

I want to add a badge to the README of this project. The idea is to
provide an easy link for people to get started contributing to this
project. A badge indicates the number of people currently subscribed
to help the repo. The color is based off of open issues in the project.

Here are some examples of other projects that have a badge in their
README:

- https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal
- https://github.com/rails/rails
- https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage

Thanks for building open source software, I would love to help you find some helpers."

ActiveRecord::Migration[4.2] corrects the error, but to run on

The same file may be required by several libraries, since Ruby only requires files once, the cost is only associated with the first library to require a file. To make this more visible duplicate entries will list all the parents they belong to. For example both `mail` and `fog` require `mime/types. So it may show up something like this in your app:

```ruby
$ derailed bundle:mem
TOP: 54.1836 mb
  mail: 18.9688 mb
    mime/types: 17.4453 mb (Also required by: fog/storage)
    mail/field: 0.4023 mb
    mail/message: 0.3906 mb
```

That way you'll know that simply removing the top level library (mail) would not result in a memory reduction. The output is trucated after the first two entries:


```ruby
fog/core: 0.9844 mb (Also required by: fog/xml, fog/json, and 48 others)
fog/rackspace: 0.957 mb
fog/joyent: 0.7227 mb
  fog/joyent/compute: 0.7227 mb
```

If you want to see everything that requires `fog/core` you can run `CUT_OFF=0 bundle exec derailed bundle:mem` to get the full output that you can then grep through manually."
