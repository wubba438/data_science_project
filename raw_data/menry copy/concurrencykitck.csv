ck_ec implements 32- and (on 64 bit platforms) 64- bit event
counts. Event counts let us easily integrate OS-level blocking (e.g.,
futexes) in lock-free protocols. Waking up waiters only locks in the
OS kernel, and does not happen at all when no waiter is blocked.

Waiters only block conditionally, if the event count's value is
still equal to some prior value.

ck_ec supports multiple producers (wakers) and consumers (waiters),
and, on x86-TSO, has a more efficient specialisation for single
producer mode. In the latter mode, the overhead compared to a version
counter is on the order of 2-3 cycles and 1-2 instructions, in the
fast path. The slow path, when there are threads blocked on the event
count, consists of one additional atomic instruction and a futex
syscall.

Similarly, the fast path for consumers, when an update comes quickly,
has no overhead compared to spinning on a read-only counter. After
a few thousand cycles, consumers (waiters) enter the slow path with
one atomic instruction and a few blocking syscalls.

The single-producer specialisation requires the x86-TSO memory model,
x86's non-atomic read-modify-write instructions, and, ideally a
futex-like OS abstraction. On !x86/x86_64 platforms, single producer
increments fall back to the multiple producer code path.

This work is from Jonathan T. Looney from the FreeBSD project
(jtl@).

The return value of ck_epoch_poll has also changed. It returns false
only if the epoch counter has not progressed, if no memory was reclaimed
(in other words, no forward progress) and / or not all threads have been
observed in a quiescent state (grace period).

Below are his notes:
Epoch calls are stored in a 4-bucket hash table. The 4-bucket hash table
allows for calls to be stored for three epochs: the current epoch and
two previous ones. The comments at the beginning of ck_epoch.c explain
why this is necessary.

When there are active threads, ck_epoch_poll_deferred() current runs the
epoch calls for the current global epoch + 1. Because of modulo
arithmetic, this is equivalent to running the calls for epoch - 3.
However, this means that ck_epoch_poll_deferred() is waiting
unnecessarily long to run epoch calls.

Further, there could be races in incrementing the global epoch. Imagine
all active threads have observed epoch n. CPU 0 sees this. It increments
the global epoch to (n + 1). It runs the epoch calls for (n - 3). Now,
CPU 1 checks. It sees that there are active threads which have not yet
observed the new global epoch (n + 1). In this case,
ck_epoch_poll_deferred() will return without running any epochs. In the
worst case (CPU 1 continually losing the race), these epoch calls could
be deferred indefinitely.

To fix this, always run any epoch calls for global epoch - 2. Further,
if all active threads have observed the global epoch, run epoch calls
for global epoch - 1.

The global epoch is only incremented when all active threads have

This primarily affects the FreeBSD kernel, where the popcount builtin
can be problematic (relies on compiler-provided libraries). See the
history of __POPCNT__ for details [1].

- A new flag, CK_MD_CC_BUILTIN_DISABLE, can be set to indicate that CK
  should not rely on compiler builtins when possible.
- ck_cc_clz has been removed, it was unused.
- ck_internal_bsf has been removed, it was duplicate of ck_cc_ffs but broken,
  replaced in favor of ck_cc_ffs. Previous consumers were using the bsf
  instruction, eitherway.
- ck_{rhs,hs,ht} have been updated to use ck_cc_ffs*.

If FreeBSD requires the builtins for performance reasons, we will lift the
appropriate detection into ck_md (at least, bt* bs* family of functions don't
have the same problems on most targets unlike popcount).

While at it, fix the mismatch between _CK_ISB and __CK_ISB; convert
them both to CK_ISB.

This was accidentally grouped into previous commit.

The destiny of this interface for internal use is still unclear (in context of
utilization in built-in data structures). The interface is enabled by default
on x86, as it is compatible with read-side prefetch* operations and
binary-compatible with 3DNow! extension. Older compilers will waste an
additional byte (they generate 3DNow! variant) on this, but older compilers
waste more on spillage if we encode instruction. Power support is coming soon."

This inefficiency was introduced in the overhaul of
the ck_epoch API.

Synchronize is executed with respect to e. At e + 1,
references can only exist to objects logically deleted
at e or e + 1. At e + 2, however, references can only exist to
objects logically deleted at e + 1 and e + 2. In the case that a
thread observes an out of date epoch value, an increment to the
global epoch would fail as the active bit is ordered with respect
to the memory barrier in synchronize. In the case that a protected
section begins after the memory barrier, then it is guaranteed
to not acquire the hazardous reference.

This does not change granularity of deferral lists, however.
There is still a requirement of 3 deferral lists on the fast path
(4 in ck_epoch for fast path purposes) as at any moment, any given
deferral list for value e can contain references to objects with
active references from both e and e - 1."

These come in the form of CK_ELIDE_ADAPTIVE_PROTOTYPE,
CK_ELIDE_LOCK_ADAPTIVE and CK_ELIDE_UNLOCK_ADAPTIVE.
Primarily pushing this for the few that are playing with
master.

This is inspired by Andi Kleen's work for adaptive behavior
in the Linux kernel's RTM locks implementation. There are
various differences in the state machine, however. Specifically,
the concept of a retry and a busy-wait has been unified due
to state machine simplification such that any exhausted busy-wait
cycle reverts to a forfeit (a busy-wait is a specialized retry).

Follow-up work will involve allowing for is_locked behavior
to yield what users expect, if called from with-in a transaction
through the wrapper. It is warned that this will come at a performance
penalty."

I accidentally removed ck_pr_fence implicit compiler
barrier semantics in re-structure of ck_pr_fence.
This does affect the correctness of any data structures
in ck_pr_fence or the correctness of consumers of ck_pr
operations where ck_pr serves as linearization points.
The reason it does not affect any CK data structures is
that explicit compiler barriers (whether they are store/load
operations or atomic ready-modify-write operations) always
serve as linearization points.

However, if consumers are doing tricky things like using
these barriers to serialize aliased locations for correctness,
then it is possible for compiler re-ordering to bite them in
the ass."

I had the pleasure of spending a significant amount of time at the most
recent LPC with Mathieu Desnoyers and Paul McKenney. In discussing
RCU semantics in relation to epoch reclamation, it was argued that
epoch reclamation is a specialisation of RCU (rather than a generalization).
In light of this discussion, I thought it would make more sense to not expose
write-side synchronization semantics aside from ck_epoch_call (similar to
RCU call), ck_epoch_poll (identical to tick), ck_epoch_barrier and
ck_epoch_synchronization (similar to ck_epoch_synchronization). Writers will
now longer have to use write-side epoch sections but can instead rely on
epoch_barrier/synchronization for blocking semantics and ck_epoch_poll
for old tick semantics.

One advantage of this is we can avoid write-side recursion for certain workloads.
Additionally, for infrequent writes, epoch_barrier and epoch_synchronization both
allow for blocking semantics to be used so you don't have to pay the cost of
epoch_entry for non-blocking dispatch.

Example usage:
e = stack_pop(mystack);
ck_epoch_synchronize(...);
free(e);

read_begin and read_end has been replaced with ck_epoch_begin and ck_epoch_end.
If multiple writers need SMR guarantees, then they can also use ck_epoch_begin
and ck_epoch_end. Any dispatch in presence of multiple writers should be done
with-in an epoch section (for now).

There are some follow-up commits to come."

I accidentally swapped head/tail load in ck_hp_fifo (not in
ck_fifo, however). We must acquire head snapshot before tail snapshot.
An example execution history which could cause an incorrect update to occur
is below.

 - tail <- fifo.tail / fifo.head != fifo.tail
 - dequeue to empty (until final CAS which renders fifo.head = fifo.tail)
 - head <- fifo.head / (head != tail)
 - next <- fifo.head->next / next = NULL
 - As head != tail, update to next pointer (where next is NULL).

However, if

 - head <- fifo.head / (fifo.head != fifo.tail)
 - dequeue to empty (until final CAS which renders fifo.head = fifo.tail)
 - tail <- fifo.tail / fifo.head != fifo.tail
 - next <- fifo.head->next / next = NULL

If we caught tail in final transition, the by the time we read next pointer,
head would have also changed forcing us to re-read. Thanks to Hendrik Donner
for reporting this."

This is a hash table that is optimized for architectures that
implement total store ordering and workloads that are read-heavy
involving a single writer and multiple readers. Unlike traditional
non-blocking multi-producer/multi-consumer hash table
implementations this version allows for immediate re-use of deleted
buckets (no need for explicit reclamation cycles) and is more
conducive to traditional safe memory reclamation schemes used in
unmanaged languages (otherwise, we would require key duplication).

It is relatively heavy-weight for MPMC workloads on architectures
which do not implement TSO in comparison to Click's MPMC hash
table. However, it still has better performance characteristics
than a blocking hash table.

The committed version currently only provides x86_64 support. This is
being committed for review by peers and for a silent release that will
allow us to test ck_ht_spmc under high production workloads.

Next public release will include additional documentation as well as
support for other architectures.

In the mean time, please see the unit tests for example usage. Included in
this commit: Dropped -Wbad-function-cast from GCC port."

ck_epoch_reclaim is now the replacement for ck_epoch_flush.
ck_epoch_purge guarantees that all entries are reclaimed
for the provided record before exiting.

n_peak counter has been added, which provides the peak number
of items across all reclamation lists. n_reclamations provides
the number of reclamations across the lifetime of the record.
These are cleared on unregister.

ck_epoch_update has been renamed to ck_epoch_tick.

Hazardous sections which mutate shared structures are now
expected to begin with ck_epoch_write_begin and end with
ck_epoch_end.

Hazardous sections which read shared structures are now
expected to begin with ck_epoch_read_begin and end with
ck_epoch_end.

ck_hp_free is now more aggressive. It will attempt a
reclamation cycle any time the pending count is long.
I should probably add a ck_hp_retire to have a version

Making things work properly with PIC on 32-bit x86 architectures is tricky
because of our lack of %ebx. Additionally, GCC versions < 4.3 have some
problems determining what registers may be reused, causing some of the inline
assembly constraints to be a little counterintuitive. (Thanks to Ian Lance
Taylor for the suggestion to get around the reuse issues.)

This change makes us use sane assembler in cases where we're running
non-PIC and use the heavyweight versions only for PIC. There may still be
some issues in this code; for example, it's apparent that 64-bit btc and
bts intrinsic atomics are broken in the version of GCC I'm using, so those
will have to be implemented.

Additionally, the ck_stack tests currently don't work with fPIC (not sure
if that's the fault of the tests or the port). Everything does pass now in
non-PIC, excluding btc/bts tests (in my current environment)."

Add APIs for doing atomic CAS/load/store/etc on 32-bit platforms. In
some cases this also includes operations on 64-bit integers using
cmpxchg8b. It is possible we could do some additional stuff on larger
integers using SSE, but the goal of this port is to target i586/k5 and
newer processors.

Samy mentions that we may want to do something or another for making
portability easier, but I wasn't paying tons of attention when he was
talking, so I forget what that was all about. Plus it's funny to write
in a commit message.

Haven't done a full run-through of validate / benchmark tests, but
a cursory runthrough seems to indicate all passing."

Previously, we wouldn't build on 32-bit architectures, let alone
configure. This was due in part to some issues where we essentially
ignored setting CFLAGS properly.

In addition, FreeBSD and possibly other BSDs only report i386 for any
32-bit x86 architecture. This has the side-effect that we have to do
some additional guesswork to determine the actual CPU. Since we make use
of cmpxchg8b, we require an i586 machine. FreeBSD's default 32-bit gcc
-march setting is i486, so in effort to make things easier for FreeBSD
users on 32-bit, set that to i586 by default.

Linux makes this a little easier for us, since its uname actually
returns useful information about the architecture (and assumedly the
compilers for that architecture target the same arch at a minimum), so
we will refuse to work on i386 / i486 on Linux as well.

But really, I'd be slightly surprised at a ton of use on pentium/k5."
