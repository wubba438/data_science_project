* Added a new randomization type that is somewhat similar to kOrdered, but doesn't perform in a pathological way for radix_sort.

* Removed a bunch of special case code for radix sort benchmarks by implementing a custom key extractor.

* Added ability to benchmark radix_sort for the ""slow assignment"" tests.

Note: this change also modified the element being compared from a int32_t to a uint32_t so that the test could be easily performed using radix sort."

Various sort benchmarks now operate on a vector of sort functions instead of explicitly skipping sort functions in multiple locations. This change also eliminates the need to handle sort functions in switch statements in order to skip them.

The primary reason for these changes is so that it is easier to benchmark larger array sizes and/or to modify the sort functions that will be benchmarked (since it quickly becomes impractical to benchmark O(n^2) sort functions for larger array sizes)."

* Check for empty range in vector::erase(first,last)

When erase() is called on a vector with an empty range (first == last),
it should be a no-op. If erase() does not check for this case, it can
end up calling the move assignment operator for an obect with itself as
the source and dest. This is unnecessary work at best, and at worst
could cause problems if the object's implementation of the move
assignment does not handle this case well, leaving the object in an
undefined state.

This fix simply adds a check for first==last and avoids doing any work
in that case.

- Rename testmovetoself to TestMoveAssignToSelf
- Rename TestMoveAssignToSelf member movedtoself to mMovedToSelf
