cause server is overloaded, this allows server to communicate with
client and ask it to back off for N seconds by return 429 with a
Retry-After header with the amount of seconds to wait"

Prior to this change, the `on_middleware_error` error handler was being invoked on all exceptions that hit this middleware, including those which come from lower-level middleware. This has the side-effect of potentially masking exceptions from the Rails application, and is surprising because `on_middleware_error` is assumed to handle only message_bus errors."

This allows the tests to assert that the preferred behaviour is for expiry to be automatic at the correct time, and that this ocurrs on compatible backends.

The previous tests simply asserted that the backend-specific mechanism for expiring backlogs on Redis was set up, but not that it actually worked. The test could not, then, be exercised on other backends, whose implementations of backlog expiry do not have the same behaviour as those of the Redis backend.

These tests now assert the behaviour of the Redis backend, but do not invoke any private APIs specific to Redis, and can thus be applied to other backend implementations."

This test was introduced in https://github.com/SamSaffron/message_bus/commit/9c16e7ebaafaf2a3933a84fa1c517c0eba44b052 . Its purpose does not appear to be to assert that the forked process has a subscription (since no code is present to ensure that delivery ocurrs to both processes), nor does the order of publication or delivery appear to be important in this spec. All we're really interested in asserting here is that publications before a fork, from the forked process, and from the original process after the fork ocurrs, all get published and delivered. This change expresses that case much more simply.

Prior to this change, this test would fail on Redis approximately 20% of the time. With this change, it did not fail at all in 30 executions."

Handle missing ActionDispatch::Flash in Railtie"
kubakrzempek,2017-05-23 08:09:43,https://api.github.com/repos/SamSaffron/message_bus/git/commits/2eaa4cedfa15b3cd0a0083ade31f3c14dd204ab7,2eaa4cedfa15b3cd0a0083ade31f3c14dd204ab7,"Handle missing ActionDispatch::Flash in Railtie

The middleware config in Rails app operates on a MiddlewareStackProxy which more
or less acts as a recorder of the operations that is applied over default stack
when the app is initialized, hence a regular `rescue` won't work here.

There are two cases to cover:
1. Someone already ""deleted"" (meaning it will be deleted in the end but it is not just yet)
   ActionDispatch::Flash from the stack
2. ActionDispatch::Flash was never in the stack

 #1 happens with Rails4 apps that are configured to be API-only or if someone
doesn't want the middleware in their stack.
 #2 is a Rails5 API-only app behaviour.

To handle either case the initializer in `MessageBus::Rails::Railtie` is looking
for both cases and applies the MessageBus middleware appropriately.
The default behaviour can be easily changed via regular Rails config block.

```ruby
 # config/initializers/message_bus.rb
Rails.application.config do |config|
  # do anything you wish with config.middleware here
end
```"

Add PostgreSQL backend using LISTEN/NOTIFY"
jeremyevans,2016-02-26 18:29:00,https://api.github.com/repos/SamSaffron/message_bus/git/commits/5d957988afab251adae1bbf161f0c8001b0cb09f,5d957988afab251adae1bbf161f0c8001b0cb09f,"Avoid missed notifications when using the postgres backend

In very rare cases a message could be missed when using the
postgres backend.  This happened because PostgreSQL notifications
are sent on transaction commit, which can be out of sequence with
the global ids (which are created during the INSERT statement,
before transaction commit).  Here's an example

process 1: publish ""/foo"", ""a""
process 1: INSERT query run
process 2: publish ""/foo"", ""b""
process 2: INSERT query run
process 2: COMMIT
process 1: COMMIT

In the above case, the message published by process 1 will have
a lower global id than the message published by process 2, but
the notification for process 2 will go out first.  Because of
the previous two-level processing of global backlog, with one
before the LISTEN and one after, the above situation could
result in a missed notification.  If process 3 is subscribed to
channel /foo and the pre-LISTEN process global backlog ends with
the notification published by process 2 (because the transaction
committed before process 1), the highest_id returned by the
pre-LISTEN process_global_backlog would be greater than the global
id published by process 1.  If process 1 commits before process
3 LISTENs, the post-LISTEN process_global_backlog will miss the
message published by process 1.

The simplest solution is just to only proces the global backlog
post-LISTEN.  It would be possible to process the global backlog
pre-LISTEN and record any missing ids, then also check for those
ids post-LISTEN, but that's a more intrusive change."

The important fix here is always deleting from @allocated in the

issues.

Numerous other beneficial changes while here:

* Keep references to inherited sockets, so they don't get garbage
  collected. You still need to make sure to use exit! instead of
  exit in the child processes.

* Make @listening_on a hash, and store a unique value for the
  channel.  This fixes issues if you subscribe, unsubscribe, and
  resubscribe quickly.

* Add exec_prepared method which automatically calls clear on the
  PG::Result objects returned by PG::Connection#exec_prepared. This
  cleans them up as soon as they aren't needed, as opposed to
  waiting for GC.

* Use separate connection for LISTEN, instead of a connection from
  the pool.  This can fix issues if trying to use the same bus
  inside the yielded messages.

* Add better fork detection to hold and subscribe.

* Remove queue in memory stuff, since it appears to be tied to
  Redis specific code.

* Don't use a separate MessageBus::Postgres::Client connection for
  the subscribe, now that MessageBus::Postgres::Client uses a new
  PG::Connection internally."

This adds a single entry point for configuration via an options
hash.  It changes the previous configuration methods to use
.configure internally, so it should be fully backwards compatible.

The specs are now split into spec_redis and spec_postgres tasks,
with the spec task now running both.

I changed the PostgreSQL backend to pass connection options
via :backend_options.  For backwards compatibility, I didn't modify
how the Redis backend handles options.

Backends are now stores in message_bus/backends/*.rb, allowing the
use of external backends.  The backends should register themselves
in MessageBus::BACKENDS using a backend symbol key matching the
filename, and the value being the pub sub class."

This supports PostgreSQL as a backend.  Originally, I attempted to
just provide a replacement Redis object that duck-typed and worked
on PostgreSQL, but due to differences between PostgreSQL and Redis
I was not able to get it to reliably pass the multi_process_spec.

This adds a lib/message_bus/postgres/reliable_pub_sub.rb file
with the PostgreSQL support.  To use the support, you currently
need to require that file manually, then pass a
:pub_sub_class=>MessageBus::Postgres::ReliablePubSub option in
your redis_config.  Connection options to PostgreSQL go in a
:pg_config subhash.

One significant difference between this PostgreSQL backend and the
Redis one is the dropping of channel-specific backlog ids. The
PostgreSQL backend only stores a single backlog id, not separate
global and channel backlog ids.  I don't think the lack of a
channel specific backlog id should be a problem. As long as the
channel backlog id is monotonically increasing, no messages
should be missed.

This does make some minor changes to the specs to make them support
both Redis and PostgreSQL.  Most of the changes are simple and
self explanatory.  I did add a ensure exit!(0) to the specs that
fork.  You can't call a normal exit in these specs, as the
garbage collector messes with the database connection sockets,
you need to call exit!(0) to skip that.  I added the ensure because
if there is an exception, it will be caught by minitest, but the
specs will keep running in both the child and parent processes.

Currently, the PostgreSQL backend does not automatically create the
table for you on first use, you need to do that manually by calling
MessageBus::Postgres::ReliablePubSub.setup!, which also clears the
table if it already exists.

This PostgreSQL backend reliably passes all specs for me, and works
for me in a simple application.  However, I didn't do any testing
with it at scale."

This actually uses minitest/spec.  Hopefully that's fine.

This replaces rspec with minitest in the Gemfile, and removes
the redis, rack, rbtrace, guard-rspec, and rb-notify gems from
the Gemfile.  redis and rack in the gemspec and do not need to
be specified twice, guard-rspec seems to be related to rspec,
and rbtrace and rb-inotify don't seem to be needed to run the
tests.

Most of this was done mechanically using the same script I
used for converting Sequel's and all of my other libraries'
specs from rspec to minitest.

I used require_relative in the specs to get the spec_helper.
This should be fine as messagebus doesn't appear to support
ruby 1.8."

benlangfeld,2015-12-12 21:40:06,https://api.github.com/repos/SamSaffron/message_bus/git/commits/da5252c55cf6ee4152d8df9c39715db8b3135b1e,da5252c55cf6ee4152d8df9c39715db8b3135b1e,"Simple attempt at bridging message delivery race

In the case that a message is published while we're calculating the backlog, we previously missed it. If the backlog turned out to be empty, we would have begun waiting for new messages, but the published message could have been delivered to the connection manager prior to informing it of the client. This would result in the message failing to be delivered until our long-poll timeout.

This adds an in-memory backlog per client which is filled while we calculate the backlog in Redis. The combined (deduplicated) backlog is then considered for delivery, closing the gap. Any messages received between collecting the message buffer and delivering the backlog will become part of the Redis backlog response on the next request."
