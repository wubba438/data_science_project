If we find a Container that might mean that we're on a node that is inside
a Suspense boundary that is directly inside the Container root.

Imagine the div is a Container and the span is a dehydrated instance:

```
<div>
  <!--$-->
  <span />
  <!--/$-->
</div>
```

There's no way to tests this yet since I'm not actually utilizing
the return value yet.

The solution is to just use the same path to check for a Suspense boundary
as if we find a parent instance."

* Don't invoke listeners on parent of dehydrated event target

* Move Suspense boundary check to getClosestInstanceFromNode

Now getClosestInstanceFromNode can return either a host component,
host text component or suspense component when the suspense
component is dehydrated.

We then use that to ignore events on a suspense component.

* Attach the HostRoot fiber to the DOM container

This lets us detect if an event happens on this root's subtree before it
has rendered something.

* Add todo

The approach of checking isFiberMounted answers if we might be in an
in-progress hydration but it doesn't answer which root or boundary
might be in-progress so we don't know what to wait for.

This needs some refactoring.

* Refactor isFiberMountedImpl to getNearestMountedFiber

We'll need the nearest boundary for event replaying so this prepares for
that.

This surfaced an issue that we attach Hydrating tag on the root but normally
this (and Placement) is attached on the child. This surfaced an issue
that this can lead to both Placement and Hydrating effects which is not
supported so we need to ensure that we only ever use one or the other.

* Add todo for bug I spotted

* Cache tags

* Check the ContainerInstanceKey before the InstanceKey

The container is inside the instance, so we must find it before the
instance, since otherwise we'll miss it."

This is a partial replacement for the 'Press' responder:

1. `useTap` is scoped to pointers (no keyboard support). Our current thinking is
that ""responders"" should be limited to working with pointers, and that they can
be combined with 'useKeyboard' in user-space. For example, we might create a
'usePress' hook in user-space that combines 'useTap' with 'useKeyboard' to react
to both pointers and keyboard interactions.

2. `useTap` cancels the gesture once the pointer moves over an element that is
not within the responder target's subtree. This differs from `usePress` (and
React Native), where the gesture remains active after the pointer exits the
target's subtree and is restarted once the pointer reenters. One of the
drawbacks with the `usePress` behavior is that it requires repeatedly measuring
DOM elements (which can cause jank) to perform hit region tests. `useTap` avoids
doing this and relies on `document.elementFromPoint` only to support the
TouchEvent fallbacks.

3. `useTap` calls `onTapUpdate` when the active gesture's state changes,
`onTapEnd` when the gesture successfully completes. and `onTapCancel` when it
fails. There is no `onTap` callback. `usePress` did not explicitly report back
when the gesture failed, and product developers were confused about the
difference between `onPress` and `onPressEnd`.

4. `useTap` explicitly separates the PointerEvent implementation from the
MouseEvent/TouchEvent fallback.

5. `useTap` has better unit test coverage . All pointer types and the fallback
environment are tested. The shape of the gesture state object is also defined
and tested."

This babel transform is a fork of the @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx transform and is for experimentation purposes only. We don't plan to own this code in the future, and we will upstream this to Babel at some point once we've proven out the concept.

As per the RFC to simplify element creation, we want to change the JSX transform from targeting React.createElement(type, props, children) to React.jsx(type, props, key). This modifies the existing @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx (and helper) babel plugin to support React.jsx and React.jsxDEV.

The main differences between React.jsx/React.jsxDEV and React.createElement are:
1.) key is now passed as an explicit argument rather than through props
3.) children are now passed through props rather than as an explicit argument
4.) props must always be an object
5.) __source and and __self are now passed as separate arguments into React.jsxDEV rather than through props

Part of the rationale for this change is that we want to deprecate key spread through props because this is an expensive dynamic comparison operation. We want users instead always explicitly pass key as a prop. However, in the interim, we need a way to distinguish between <div {...props} key={foo} /> and <div key={foo} {...props} />. Therefore, until we completely deprecate key spreading, we will use React.createElement to transform <div {...props} key=""Hi"" /> and React.jsx to transform everything else."

* Fix copy paste mistake

* Remove init path dependency on ArrayBuffer

* Add a regression test for cancelling multiple tasks

* Prevent deopt from adding isQueued later

* Remove pop() calls that were added for profiling

* Verify that Suspend/Unsuspend events match up in tests

This currently breaks tests.

* Treat Suspend and Resume as exiting and entering work loop

Their definitions used to be more fuzzy. For example, Suspend didn't always fire on exit, and sometimes fired when we did _not_ exit (such as at task enqueue).

I chatted to Boone, and he's saying treating Suspend and Resume as strictly exiting and entering the loop is fine for their use case.

* Revert ""Prevent deopt from adding isQueued later""

This reverts commit 9c30b0b695d81e9c43b296ab93d895e4416ef713.

This patch formalizes the mock native events and event sequences used in unit tests.

The `createEventTarget` function returns an object that can be used to dispatch native event sequences on the target without having to manually do so across all the scenarios we need to account for. Unit tests can be written as if we were only working with PointerEvent, but they will dispatch realistic native event sequences based on the execution environment (e.g., is PointerEvent supported?) and pointer type.

```
describe.each(environments)('Suite', (hasPointerEvents) => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // setup
  });

  test.each(pointerTypes)('Test', (pointerType) => {
    const target = createEventTarget(node);
    target.pointerdown({pointerType});
    expect(callback).toBeCalled();
  });
});
```

Every native event that is dispatched now includes a complete object by default. The properties of the events can be customized. Properties that shouldn't be relied on in responder implementations are excluded from the mock native events to ensure tests will fail.

* [Scheduler] Mark user-timing events

Marks when Scheduler starts and stops running a task. Also marks when
a task is initially scheduled, and when Scheduler is waiting for a
callback, which can't be inferred from a sample-based JavaScript CPU
profile alone.

The plan is to use the user-timing events to build a Scheduler profiler
that shows how the lifetime of tasks interact with each other and
with unscheduled main thread work.

The test suite works by printing an text representation of a
Scheduler flamegraph.

* Expose shared array buffer with profiling info

Array contains

- the priority Scheduler is currently running
- the size of the queue
- the id of the currently running task

* Replace user-timing calls with event log

Events are written to an array buffer using a custom instruction format.
For now, this is only meant to be used during page start up, before the
profiler worker has a chance to start up. Once the worker is ready, call
`stopLoggingProfilerEvents` to return the log up to that point, then
send the array buffer to the worker.

Then switch to the sampling based approach.

* Record the current run ID

Each synchronous block of Scheduler work is given a unique run ID. This
is different than a task ID because a single task will have more than
one run if it yields with a continuation."

Provides partial support for React.lazy() components from the existing PartialRenderer server-side renderer.

Lazy components which are already resolved (or rejected), perhaps with something like `react-ssr-prepass`, can be continued into synchronously. If they have not yet been initialized, they'll be initialized before checking, opening the possibility to exploit this capability with a babel transform. If they're pending (which will typically be the case for a just initialized async ctor) then the existing invariant continues to be thrown."

HTML before we can hydrate. This should mean that we're showing the

* Move dehydrated to be child of regular SuspenseComponent

We now store the comment node on SuspenseState instead and that indicates
that this SuspenseComponent is still dehydrated.

We also store a child but that is only used to represent the DOM node for
deletions and getNextHostSibling.

* Move logic from DehydratedSuspenseComponent to SuspenseComponent

Forked based on SuspenseState.dehydrated instead.

* Retry logic for dehydrated boundary

We can now simplify the logic for retrying dehydrated boundaries without
hydrating. This is becomes simply a reconciliation against the dehydrated
fragment which gets deleted, and the new children gets inserted.

* Remove dehydrated from throw

Instead we use the regular Suspense path. To save code, we attach retry
listeners in the commit phase even though technically we don't have to.

* Pop to nearest Suspense

I think this is right...?

* Popping hydration state should skip past the dehydrated instance

* Split mount from update and special case suspended second pass

The DidCapture flag isn't used consistently in the same way. We need
further refactor for this.

* Reorganize update path

If we remove the dehydration status in the first pass and then do a second
pass because we suspended, then we need to continue as if it didn't
previously suspend. Since there is no fragment child etc.

However, we must readd the deletion.

* Schedule context work on the boundary and not the child

* Warn for Suspense hydration in legacy mode

It does a two pass render that client renders the content.

* Rename DehydratedSuspenseComponent -> DehydratedFragment

This now doesn't represent a suspense boundary itself. Its parent does.

This Fiber represents the fragment around the dehydrated content.

* Refactor returns

Avoids the temporary mutable variables. I kept losing track of them.

* Add a comment explaining the type.

Placing it in the type since that's the central point as opposed to spread
out."

**Problem**

The existing responders listen to pointer events by default and add fallback events if PointerEvent is not supported. However, this complicates the responders and makes it easy to create a problematic unit test environment. jsdom doesn't support PointerEvent, which means that the responders end up listening to pointer events *and* fallback events in unit tests. This isn't a direct problem in production environments, because no browser will fire pointer events if they aren't supported. But in the unit test environment, we often dispatch event sequences taken from browsers that support pointer events. This means that what we're often testing is actually a (complex) scenario that cannot even occur in production: a responder that is listening to and receives both pointer events and fallback events. Not only does this risk making responders more complicated to implement but it could also hide bugs in implementations.

**Response**

Implement the responders so that they're only listening to *either* pointer events *or* fallback events, never both. This should make the default pointer events implementations significantly simpler and easier to test, as well as free to rely on the complete PointerEvents API. In the future it should also make DCE easier for target environments that are known to support PointerEvents, as we can use build tools with an equivalent of the runtime check. The fallback events (touch and mouse) need to coexist and be resilient to browser emulated events. Our unit tests should express a suite of high-level interactions that can be run in environments with and without PointerEvents support."

timers) to an array-based min binary heap.

This replaces the naive linked-list implementation that was left over
from the queue we once used to schedule React roots. A list was arguably
fine when it was only used for roots, since the total number of roots is
usually small, and is only 1 in the common case of a single-page app.

Since Scheduler is now used for many types of JavaScript tasks (e.g.
including timers), the total number of tasks can be much larger.

Binary heaps are the standard way to implement priority queues.
Insertion is O(1) in the average case (append to the end) and O(log n)
in the worst. Deletion is O(log n). Peek is O(1).

This happens in this case: `<!--$!--><!--$!-->...<!--/$--><!--/$-->...`

getNextHydratableInstanceAfterSuspenseInstance didn't take
SUSPENSE_FALLBACK_START_DATA or SUSPENSE_PENDING_START_DATA into account
so if a boundary was in one of those states, it wouldn't be considered to
push the stack of boundaries. As a result the first end comment was
considered the end but it really should've been the second end comment.

The next comment then would've been considered something that can be
skipped. However, since the logic in there considered all comments as
""hydratable"", it was considered a hydratable node. Since it was considered
a node that didn't actually correspond to anything in the React tree it got
deleted.

The HTML is now `<!--$!--><!--$!-->...<!--/$-->...` and the trailing
content is now hydrated since it did match something.

Next, since this was client rendered, we're going to delete the suspended
boundary by calling clearSuspenseBoundary and then inserting new content.
However, clearSuspenseBoundary *is* aware of SUSPENSE_FALLBACK_START_DATA
and assumes that there must be another `<!--/$-->` after the first one.
As a result it deleted the trailing content from the DOM since it should
be part of the boundary. However, those DOM nodes were already hydrated in
the React tree. So we end up in an inconsistent state.

When we then try to insert the new content we throw as a result.

I think we would have recovered correctly if clearSuspenseBoundary and
getNextHydratableInstanceAfterSuspenseInstance had the *same* bug but
because they were inconsistent we ended up in a bad place."

When React schedules a rendering task, it passes a `timeout` option
based on its expiration time. This is intended to avoid starvation
by other React updates. However, it also affects the relative priority
of React tasks and other Scheduler tasks at the same level, like
data processing.

This adds a feature flag to disable passing a `timeout` option to
Scheduler. React tasks will always append themselves to the end of
the queue, without jumping ahead of already scheduled tasks.

This does not affect the order in which React updates within a single
root are processed, but it could affect updates across multiple roots.

This also doesn't remove the expiration from Scheduler. It only means
that React tasks are not given special treatment."

The clean-up function of a passive effect (`useEffect`) usually fires
in a post-commit task, after the browser has painted. However, there is
an exception when the component (or its parent) is deleted from the
tree. In that case, we fire the clean-up function during the
synchronous commit phase, the same phase we use for layout effects.

This is a concession to implementation complexity. Calling it in the
passive effect phase would require either traversing the children of the
deleted fiber again, or including unmount effects as part of the fiber
effect list.

Because the functions are called during the sync phase in this case,
the Scheduler priority is Immediate (the one used for layout) instead
of Normal. We may want to reconsider this trade off later."

Effects currently have the same priority as the render that spawns them.
This changes the behavior so that effects always have normal priority,
or lower if the render priority is lower (e.g. offscreen prerendering).

The implementation is a bit awkward because of the way `renderRoot`,

In this PR, for tests (specifically, code inside an `act()` scope), we immediately trigger work that would have otherwise required a timeout. This makes it simpler to tests loading/spinner states, and makes tests resilient to changes in React.

For some of our tests(specifically, ReactSuspenseWithNoopRenderer-test.internal), we _don't_ want fallbacks to immediately trigger, because we're testing intermediate states and such. Added a feature flag `flushSuspenseFallbacksInTests` to disable this behaviour on a per case basis."

Adds experimental flag to yield many times per frame using a message
event loop, instead of the current approach of guessing the next vsync
and yielding at the end of the frame.

This new approach forgoes a `requestAnimationFrame` entirely. It posts a
message event and performs a small amount of work (5ms) before yielding
to the browser, regardless of where it might be in the vsync cycle. At
the end of the event, if there's work left over, it posts another
message event.

This should keep the main thread responsive even for really high frame
rates. It also shouldn't matter if the hardware frame rate changes after
page load (our current heuristic only detects if the frame rate
increases, not decreases).

The main risk is that yielding more often will exacerbate main thread
contention with other browser tasks.

Let's try it and see."

The Scheduler implementation uses browser APIs like `MessageChannel`,
`requestAnimationFrame`, and `setTimeout` to schedule work on the main
thread. Most of our tests treat these as implementation details;
however, the sequence and timing of these APIs are not precisely
specified, and can vary wildly across browsers.

To prevent regressions, we need the ability to simulate specific edge
cases that we may encounter in various browsers.

This adds a new test suite that mocks all browser methods used in our
implementation. It assumes as little as possible about the order and
timing of events. The only thing it assumes is that
requestAnimationFrame is passed a frame time that is equal to or less
than the time returned by performance.now. Everything else can be
controlled at will.

It also includes Scheduler-specific invariants, e.g. only one rAF
callback can be scheduled at a time.

It overlaps slightly with the existing SchedulerDOM-test suite, which
also mocks the browser APIs, but exposes a higher-level set of testing
primitives. I will consolidate the two suites in a follow-up."

Scheduler uses `requestAnimationFrame` to post tasks to the browser.
If this happens at the beginning of a frame, the callback might not
fire until the subsequent frame, even if the main thread is idle.

Our theory was that this wouldn't be an issue in practice, because once
the first rAF fires, we schedule the next rAF as early as possible in
that frame. Combined with our heuristic for computing frame deadlines,
we shouldn't get any idle time in between frames — only before the
*first* frame.

This reasoning holds true when you have a small number of large tasks,
such as the ones posted by React. The idle time before the task starts
is negligible relative to the lifetime of the entire task.

However, it does not hold if you have many small tasks posted over a
span of time, perhaps spawned by a flurry of IO events. In this case,
instead of single, contiguous rAF loop preceded by an idle frame, you
get many rAF loops preceded by many idle frames. Our new theory is that
this is contributing to poor main thread utilization during page loads.

To try to reclaim as much idle time as possible, this PR adds two
experimental flags. The first one adds a `requestIdleCallback` call to
start the rAF loop, which will fire before rAF if there's idle time left
in the frame. (We still call rAF in case there isn't. We start working
in whichever event fires first.)

The second flag tries a similar strategy using `setTimeout(fn, 0)`. If
the timer fires before rAF, we'll assume that the main thread is idle.

If either `requestIdleCallback` or `setTimeout` fires before rAF, we'll
immediately peform some work. Since we don't have a real frame time that
we can use to compute the frame deadline, we'll do an entire frame
length of work. This will probably push us past the vsync, but this is
fine because we can catch up during the next frame, by which point a
real rAF will have fired and the loop can proceed the same way it
does today.

Test plan: Try this on Facebook to see if it improves load times"

- ReactDOM.render being used inside another component tree. The parent component will be rendered using ReactTestRenderer.create for a snapshot test or something.
- a ReactDOM instance interacting with a ReactTestRenderer instance (like for the new devtools)

This PR changes the way the acting sigils operate to allow for this. It keeps 2 booleans, one attached to React, one attached to the renderer. act() changes these values, and the workloop reads them to decide what warning to trigger.

* Add a bunch of optimizations to SuspenseList

We now are able to bail out of reconciliation and splitting out the tail
during deep updates that hasn't changed the child props. This only
works while the list wasn't suspended before.

I also moved the second render of the ""head"" to the complete phase. This
cleans it up a bit for the tail collapsing PR.

For this second pass I also use a new technique of resetting the child
Fibers for the second pass. This is effectively a fast path to avoid
reconciling the children against props again.

* Move to didSuspend from SuspenseListState to the effectTag

The effectTag now tracks whether the previous commit was suspended.

This frees up SuspenseListState to be render-phase only state.

We use null to mean the default ""independent"" mode.

* Rename to SuspenseListState to SuspenseListRenderState

* Reuse SuspenseListRenderState across render passes

* Add optimization to bail out of scanning children if they can't be suspended

This optimized the deep update case or initial render without anything
suspending.

We have some information available to us that tell us if nothing has
suspended in the past and nothing has suspended this render pass.

This also fixes a bug where we didn't tag the previous render as having
suspended boundaries if we didn't need to force a rerender.

* warn if passive effects get queued outside of an act() call

While the code itself isn't much (it adds the warning to mountEffect() and updateEffect() in ReactFiberHooks), it does change a lot of our tests. We follow a bad-ish pattern here, which is doing asserts inside act() scopes, but it makes sense for *us* because we're testing intermediate states, and we're manually flush/yield what we need in these tests.

This commit has one last failing test. Working on it.

* pass lint

* pass failing test, fixes another

- a test was failing in ReactDOMServerIntegrationHooks while testing an effect; the behaviour of yields was different from browser and server when wrapped with act(). further, because of how we initialized modules, act() around renders wasn't working corrrectly. solved by passing in ReactTestUtils in initModules, and checking on the finally yielded values in the specific test.
- in ReactUpdates, while testing an infinite recursion detection, the test needed to be wrapped in an act(), which would have caused the recusrsion error to throw. solived by rethrowing the error from inside the act().

When `isInputPending` is not available, this has no effect, because we
yield at the end of every frame regardless.

React will call `requestPaint` in the commit phase as long as there's at
least one effect. We could choose not to call it if none of the effects

At the end of each frame, Scheduler yields control of the main thread so
the browser can execute important tasks; most importantly, painting the
screen and responding to user input. There's some overhead involved in
regaining control of the main thread, so we'd like to yield as
infrequently as possible to keep the UI responsive.

The reason we yield on every frame is because there's no way for us to
know whether we're blocking user input.

`isInputPending` is an experimental browser API that gives us this
information. It tells us whether there's a pending user input, which
also means it tells us if there's *not* a pending user input. We can use
this signal to decide whether it's OK not to yield.

There's a max frame length after which we'll yield regardless, as a
precaution against blocking non-input tasks that we don't know about."

* Expire rendering the tail of SuspenseList after a timeout

This is the first Suspense feature that isn't actually dependent on IO.

The thinking here is that it's normal for a SuspenseList to show loading
states, and it'll be designed to handle it one at a time.

However, sometimes there are lists with really big items that take a long
time to CPU render. Since data can become available as we do that, it is
likely that we have all the data and become CPU bound.

In that case, the list would naively just render until the end and then
display all items at once. I think that's actually what you want for fast
lists. However, for slow ones (like News Feed), you're better off showing
a few rows at a time.

It's not necessarily one at a time because if you can do many in a short
period of time and fit them all on the screen, then it's better to do them
all at once than pop them in one at a time very quickly.

Therefore, I use a heuristic of trying to render as many rows as I can in
500ms before giving up.

This timer starts before the first row of the tail and we only check it
after. This ensures that we always make a little progress each attempt.
An alternative approach could be to start the time before doing the head
of the list but we don't want that being slow prevent us from making
further progress.

Currently, I disable this optimization at Never priority because there's
nothing intermediate that becomes visible anyway.

* Fix tracing through a SuspenseList

This ensures that we can spawn new work during render through arbitrary
priorities.

We'll need this for other features too.

Since each priority can commit separately we need to use an array to
include the current interactions on each priority."

Adds a `delay` option to `scheduleCallback`. When specified, the task is
not scheduled until after the delay has elapsed.

Delayed tasks are scheduled on a timer queue maintained by Scheduler,
instead of directly with the browser. The main benefit is to reduce the
number of native browser timers that Scheduler's `message` event handler
has to contend with; so, after yielding to the browser at the end of the
frame, Scheduler will more quickly regain control of the main thread.
Because we're able to flush the timer queue without yielding to browser
timer events, there's also less task switching overhead (though in the
absence of `isInputPending`, this is mostly a theoretical win since we
yield every frame regardless).

If the queue of non-delayed tasks is non-empty — that is, if there is
pending CPU bound work — Scheduler is able to avoid a browser timer
entirely by periodically checking its own timer queue while flushing
tasks (inside the `message` event handler). Once the CPU-bound work is
complete, if there are still pending delayed tasks, Scheduler will
schedule a single browser timer that fires once the earliest delay
has elapsed."

* [scheduler] Internal rename: Callback -> Task

Rename Callback type to Task. Does not affect the public API, only
internal names, though eventually we'll probably want to align with the
WICG Main-thread Scheduling proposal
(https://github.com/WICG/main-thread-scheduling).

* [scheduler] flushFirstTask() -> flushTask(task)

Pass task as an argument to `flushTask` instead of using a module-
level variable.

* [scheduler] Add startTime field

This does not change any semantics, but in the future `startTime` may
represent a future time, to support delayed tasks.

* [Scheduler] Use continuation pattern for host cb

As I prepare to implement integrated timers, I noticed some
peculiarities in the Scheduler implementation that could afford to be
cleaned up.

This is a refactor and shouldn't affect any observable behavior; mostly
it removes some concepts that existed in earlier iterations of Scheduler
and are no longer needed.

The main change is to how the DOM implementation schedules an additional
callback before yielding to the main thread. It used to follow the same
code path for scheduling task; now it has its own branch directly
inside the message event handler. The special case for error handling
— where we call `postMessage` immediately without waiting for rAF —
has similarly been localized inside the catch block of the message
event handler."

Follow up to #15861.

Turns out you can't set `!important` using a normal property assignment.
You have to use `style.setProperty`.

Maybe Andrew *should* just learn CSS.

IE9 doesn't support `style.setProperty` so we'll fall back to setting
`display: none` without `important`, like we did before #15861 Our
advice for apps that need to support IE9 will be to avoid using
`!important`. Which seems like good advice in general, but IANACSSE.

Suspended nodes are hidden using an inline `display: none` style. We do
this instead of removing the nodes from the DOM so that their state is
preserved when they are shown again.

Inline styles have the greatest specificity, but they are superseded by
`!important`. To prevent an external style from overriding React's, this
commit changes the hidden style to `display: none !important`.

The render time call says when's a good time to capture the lazy Hooks tree. This is necessary for supporting inline requires. I will do that in next commit.

* Lazily compute Hook list on first render

This ensures inline requires don't break comparisons between Hook signatures of previous and next versions by caching Hook list at the time of first render.

* [Events] Add EventPriority enum

React DOM's DispatchConfig for synthetic events has an `isDiscrete`
field that affects how updates triggered by an event are scheduled.
Events are either discrete or continuous.

This commit adds an additional type of configuration where an event
has user-blocking priority, but is not discrete. E.g. updates triggered
by hover are more important than the default, but they don't need to
be processed serially. Because there are now three types of event
priority instead of two, I've replaced the `isDiscrete` boolean with an
enum: `eventPriority`.

This commit implements the new enum value but does not change any
behavior. I'll enable it behind a feature flag in the next commit.

I've only implemented this in the legacy event system. I'll leave Flare
for a follow-up.

* enableUserBlockingEvents feature flag

Adds a feature flag to increase the priority of events like `mouseover`,
without making them discrete."

This commit is a follow-up to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15604, which explains more of the rationale behind moving React Native to path-based imports and the work needed in the React repository. In that linked PR, the generated renderers were updated but not the shims; this commit updates the shims.

The problem is that FB needs a different copy of the built renderers than the OSS versions so we need a way for FB code to import different modules than in OSS. This was previously done with Haste, but with the removal of Haste from RN, we need another mechanism. Talking with cpojer, we are using a `.fb.js` extension that Metro can be configured to prioritize over `.js`.

This commit generates FB's renderers with the `.fb.js` extension and OSS renderers with just `.js`. This way, FB can internally configure Metro to use the `.fb.js` implementations and OSS will use the `.js` ones, letting us swap out which implementation gets bundled.

Test Plan: Generated the renderers and shims with `yarn build` and then verified that the generated shims don't contain any Haste-style imports. Copied the renderers and shims into RN manually and launched the RNTester app to verify it loads end-to-end. Added `.fb.js` to the extensions in `metro.config.js` and verified that the FB-specific bundles loaded."

If an event in the old system is dispatched synchronously within an
event from the new system, or vice versa, and the inner event is a
discrete update, React should not flush pending discrete updates before
firing the inner event's handlers, even if the outer event is not
discrete.

Another way of saying this is that nested events should never force
React to flush discrete updates.

Arguably, if the outer event is not a discrete event, then the inner
event _should_ flush the pending events. However, that would be a
breaking change. I would argue this isn't so bad, however, given that
nested events are pretty rare. They don't fit nicely into our event
model regardless, since we don't support nested React renders. In the

* Track most recent commit time of a fallback globally

This value is going to be used to avoid committing too many fallback
states in quick succession. It doesn't really matter where in the tree
that happened.

This means that we now don't really need the concept of SuspenseState
other than has a flag. It could be made cheaper/simpler.

* Change suspense heuristic

This now eagerly commits non-delayed suspended trees, unless they're
only retries in which case they're throttled to 500ms.

* Restart early if we're going to suspend later

* Use the local variable where appropriate

* Make ReactLazy tests less specific on asserting intermediate states

They're not testing the exact states of the suspense boundaries, only
the result. I keep assertions that they're not already resolved early.

* Adjust Profiler tests to the new heuristics

* Update snapshot tests for user timing tests

I also added a blank initial render to ensuree that we cover the suspended
case.

* Adjust Suspense tests to account for new heuristics

Mostly this just means render the Suspense boundary first so that it
becomes an update instead of initial mount.

* Track whether we have a ping on the currently rendering level

If we get a ping on this level but have not yet suspended, we might
still suspend later. In that case we should still restart.

* Add comment about moving markers

We should add this to throwException so we get these markers earlier.
I've had to rewrite tests that test restarting to account for the delayed
restarting heuristic.

Ideally, we should also be able to restart from within throwException if
we're already ready to restart. Right now we wait until the next yield.

* Add test for restarting during throttled retry

* Lint rule for unminified errors

Add a lint rule that fails if an invariant message is not part of the
error code map.

The goal is to be more disciplined about adding and modifiying
production error codes. Error codes should be consistent across releases
even if their wording changes, for continuity in logs.

Currently, error codes are added to the error code map via an automated
script that runs right before release. The problem with this approach is
that if someone modifies an error message in the source, but neglects to
modify the corresponding message in the error code map, then the message
will be assigned a new error code, instead of reusing the existing one.

Because the error extraction script only runs before a release, people
rarely modify the error code map in practice. By moving the extraction
step to the PR stage, it forces the author to consider whether the
message should be assigned a new error code. It also allows the reviewer
to review the changes.

The trade off is that it requires more effort and context to land new
error messages, or to modify existing ones, particular for new
contributors who are not familiar with our processes.

Since we already expect users to lint their code, I would argue the
additional burden is marginal. Even if they forget to run the lint
command locally, they will get quick feedback from the CI lint job,
which typically finishes within 2-3 minutes.

* Generate signatures for Hooks

This currently only works one level deep. For custom Hooks, we'll need to add some way to compose signatures.

* Be more resilient to plugin conflicts

This prevents a class of problems where other plugins cause our visitor to re-run.

It's a standard Babel practice, e.g.:

https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/8c7d4b55c99ff34cb9d493d452472e59b5ed1e70/packages/babel-plugin-transform-react-constant-elements/src/index.js#L85-L86

* Remove unnecessary stuff from debugging

* Include Foo.useHookName() calls into the signature

* Add an integration test for adding/removing an effect

* Add integration test for changing custom Hook order

* Include custom Hooks into the signatures

* Fix inferred names for function expressions

* Support export default hoc(Foo) when Foo is defined separately

* Add more built-in Hooks"

* [react-native] Use path-based imports instead of Haste for the RN renderer

To move React Native to standard path-based imports instead of Haste, the RN renderer that is generated from the code in this repo needs to use path-based imports as well since the generated code is vendored by RN. This commit makes it so the interface between the generated renderers and RN does not rely on Haste and instead uses a private interface explicitly defined by RN. This inverts control of the abstraction so that RN decides the internals to export rather than React deciding what to import.

On RN's side, a new module named `react-native/Libraries/ReactPrivate/ReactNativePrivateInterface` explicitly exports the modules used by the renderers in this repo. (There is also a private module for InitializeCore so that we can import it just for the side effects.) On React's side, the various renderer modules access RN internals through the explicit private interface.

The Rollup configuration becomes slimmer since the only external package is now `react-native`, and the individual modules are instead listed out in `ReactNativePrivateInterface`.

Task description: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24770
Sister RN PR (needs to land before this one): https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24782

Test Plan: Ran unit tests and Flow in this repo. Generated the renderers and manually copied them over to the RN repo. Ran the RN tests and launched the RNTester app.

* Access natively defined ""nativeFabricUIManager"" instead of importing it

Some places in the Fabric renderers access `nativeFabricUIManager` (a natively defined global) instead of importing UIManager. While this is coupling across repos that depends on the timing of events, it is necessary until we have a way to defer top-level imports to run after `nativeFabricUIManager` is defined. So for consistency we use `nativeFabricUIManager` everywhere (see the comment in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15604#pullrequestreview-236842223 for more context)."

* Fix missing return pointer assignment

I found a bug using the fuzz tester that manifested as incorrect
ordering of children in the host tree, but whose root cause was a
missing `return` pointer assignment on a work-in-progress fiber.

Usually return pointers are set during reconciliation
(`reconcileChildFibers`) but this particular assignment happens inside
the custom reconciliation implementation used by Suspense boundaries.

I would not be surprised if there were similar bugs related to incorrect
return pointers. You're supposed to update the return pointer
whenever a work-in-progress fiber is created, but there's nothing in
the contract of the `createFiber` or `createWorkInProgress` function
that implies this. I propose that we update their signatures to accept
the return fiber as an argument. I will do this in a follow-up.

In this commit, I rearranged `updateSuspenseComponent` slightly so that
every call to `createWorkInProgress` or a `createFiber*` function is
immediately followed by a return pointer assignment.

I hardcoded the fuzz test case that surfaced the bug.

* Update all progressed children in list

`progressedPrimaryChild` is a list, not a single fiber. Need to iterate
through every child and update their return pointers."

* Add a minimal failing test for hot reload

* Set up scaffolding for React Fresh

* Consider type family when comparing elementType

Rendering an element with stale type should not cause it to remount.

We only do this for FunctionComponent tag since checking is unnecessary for classes or host components.

* Add support for forwardRef()

Initially I thought I would compare families of inner .render functions.

However, there is a corner case where this can create false positives. Such as when you forwardRef(X) the same X twice. Those are supposed to be distinct. But if we compare .render functions, we wouldn't be able to distinguish them after first reload.

It seems safer to rely on explicit registration for those. This should be easy when forwardRef() call is in the same file, and usually it would be. For cases like HOCs and style.div`...` factories that return forwardRef(), we could have the __register__ helper itself ""dig deeper"" and register the inner function.

* Show how forwardRef inner identity can be inferred

The __register__ implementation can read the inner identity itself.

* Add missing __DEV__ to tests

* Add support for memo() (without fixing bailouts)

This adds rudimentary support for memo components. However, we don't actually skip bailouts yet, so this is not very useful by itself alone. Tests have TODOs that we need to remove after bailout skipping is done.

* Refactor type comparison for clarity

* Hot update shouldn't re-render ancestor components unnecessarily

My code had a bug where it checked for a wrong thing in a wrong set, leading us to always re-render.

This fixes the checks so that we only schedule updates for things that were actually edited.

* Add test coverage for memo(fn, areEqual)

* Explicitly skip bailouts for hot reloading fibers

This forces even memo() with shallow comparison to re-render on hot update.

* Refactor scheduling update to reduce duplication

* Remove unused variable in test

* Don't check presence in a set while not hot reloading

* Make scheduleHotUpdate() take named arguments

* Don't keep unedited component types in the type => family map

It's unnecessary because if they haven't been edited, there's no special reconciliation logic.

* Add signatures that force remounting

Signatures let us force a remount of a type even if from React's point of view, type is the same.

A type has one current signature. If that signature changes during next hot update, all Fibers with that type should be deleted and remounted.

We do this by mutating elementType scheduling a parent.

This will be handy to force remount of mismatching Hooks, as well as failed error boundaries.

For this to fully work, we'll need to add a way to skip built-in bailouts for all Fiber types. This will be the most invasive and annoying change. I did it for HostRoot in this PR but there's more. I'll add an automated test case that catches the missing bailout bailouts.

* Support forced remounting for all component types

This teaches all parent component types to remount their child if necessary.

It also adds tests for them.

* Remount effects while preserving state for hot reloaded components

This makes sure that changes to *code* always propagate.

It can break components that aren't resilient to useEffect over-firing, but that seems like a good constraint since you might need to add a dependency later anyway, and this helps avoid coding yourself into the corner.

* Add missing __DEV__ blocks to tests

* Fix unused variables in tests

* Remove outdated TODO

* Expose scheduleHotUpdate directly

* Inline isCompatibleType

* Run one check per component for invalidating deps

This also makes the bailouts more targeted--no need to remount useEffect for a parent component of remounted fiber.

* Resolve .type early

This moves resolving to set up the right .type early instead of doing this before render.
A bit more future-proof in case we want to restructure the begin phase later.

ForwardRef is special because its type is a wrapper but it can be hot reloaded by itself.
So we have a special overload for it that reconstucts the wrapper type if needed.

* Add a Suspense todo

* Use current.type !== workInProgress.type for ignoring deps

This gets rid of one of the sets.

* Use workInProgress.type !== current.type check for force re-render

We still use a set for forced remount though.

* Use wip.type !== current.type check in more places

This also disables the remounting tests. They need a separate approach.

* Use a dedicated remount mechanism

* Add a test for offscreen trees

It has a TODO because it seems like offscreen updates are incorrectly applied too soon.

* Enable offscreen test now that it is fixed

* Fix corner cases in the new remounting mechanism

* Remount failed error boundaries on hot reload

* Fix test now that act() flushes

This test is manual so I don't actually want act here.

* Nits

* Add comments"

* Add suspendIfNeeded API and a global scope to track it

Adds a ""current"" suspense config that gets applied to all updates scheduled
during the current scope.

I suspect we might want to add other types of configurations to the ""batch""
so I called it the ""batch config"".

This works across renderers/roots but they won't actually necessarily go
into the same batch.

* Add the suspenseConfig to all updates created during this scope

* Compute expiration time based on the timeout of the suspense config

* Track if there was a processed suspenseConfig this render pass

We'll use this info to suspend a commit for longer when necessary.

* Mark suspended states that should be avoided as a separate flag

This lets us track which renders we want to suspend for a short time vs
a longer time if possible.

* Suspend until the full expiration time if something asked to suspend

* Reenable an old test that we can now repro again

* Suspend the commit even if it is complete if there is a minimum delay

This can be used to implement spinners that don't flicker if the data
and rendering is really fast.

* Default timeoutMs to low pri expiration if not provided

This is a required argument in the type signature but people may not
supply it and this is a user facing object.

* Rename to withSuspenseConfig and drop the default config

This allow opting out of suspending in some nested scope.

A lot of time when you use this function you'll use it with high level
helpers. Those helpers often want to accept some additional configuration
for suspense and if it should suspend at all. The easiest way is to just
have the api accept null or a suspense config and pass it through. However,
then you have to remember that calling suspendIfNeeded has a default.

It gets simpler by just saying tat you can pass the config. You can have
your own default in user space.

* Track the largest suspense config expiration separately

This ensures that if we've scheduled lower pri work that doesn't have a
suspenseConfig, we don't consider its expiration as the timeout.

* Add basic tests for functionality using each update mechanism

* Fix issue when newly created avoided boundary doesn't suspend with delay

* s/flushPassiveEffects/unstable_flushWithoutYielding

a first crack at flushing the scheduler manually from inside act(). uses unstable_flushWithoutYielding(). The tests that changed, mostly replaced toFlushAndYield(...) with toHaveYielded(). For some tests that tested the state of the tree before flushing effects (but still after updates), I replaced act() with bacthedUpdates().

* ugh lint

* pass build, flushPassiveEffects returns nothing now

* pass test-fire

* flush all work (not just effects), add a compatibility mode

of note, unstable_flushWithoutYielding now returns a boolean much like flushPassiveEffects

* umd build for scheduler/unstable_mock, pass the fixture with it

* add a comment to Shcduler.umd.js for why we're exporting unstable_flushWithoutYielding

* run testsutilsact tests in both sync/concurrent modes

* augh lint

* use a feature flag for the missing mock scheduler warning

I also tried writing a test for it, but couldn't get the scheduler to unmock. included the failing test.

* Update ReactTestUtilsAct-test.js

- pass the mock scheduler warning test,
- rewrite some tests to use Scheduler.yieldValue
- structure concurrent/legacy suites neatly

* pass failing tests in batchedmode-test

* fix pretty/lint/import errors

* Failing test for false positive warning

* Flush passive effects before discrete events

Currently, we check for pending passive effects inside the `setState`
method before we add additional updates to the queue, in case those
pending effects also add things to the queue.

However, the `setState` method is too late, because the event that
caused the update might not have ever fired had the passive effects
flushed before we got there.

This is the same as the discrete/serial events problem. When a serial
update comes in, and there's already a pending serial update, we have to
do it before we call the user-provided event handlers. Because the event
handlers themselves might change as a result of the pending update.

This commit moves the `flushPassiveEffects` call to before the discrete
event handlers are called, and removes it from the `setState` method.
Non-discrete events will not cause passive effects to flush, which is
fine, since by definition they are not order dependent."

If React finishes rendering a tree, delays committing it (e.g.
Suspense), then subsequently starts over or renders a new tree, the
pending tree is no longer valid. That's because rendering a new work-in
progress mutates the old one in place.

The current structure of the work loop makes this hard to reason about
because, although `renderRoot` and `commitRoot` are separate functions,
they can't be interleaved. If they are interleaved by accident, it
either results in inconsistent render output or invariant violations
that are hard to debug.

This commit adds an invariant that throws if the new tree is the same as
the old one. This won't prevent all bugs of this class, but it should
catch the most common kind.

To implement the invariant, I store the finished tree on a field on the
root. We already had a field for this, but it was only being used for
the unstable `createBatch` feature.

A more rigorous way to address this type of problem could be to unify
`renderRoot` and `commitRoot` into a single function, so that it's
harder to accidentally interleave the two phases. I plan to do something
like this in a follow-up."

* Add Batched Mode

React has an unfortunate quirk where updates are sometimes synchronous
-- where React starts rendering immediately within the call stack of
`setState` — and sometimes batched, where updates are flushed at the
end of the current event. Any update that originates within the call
stack of the React event system is batched. This encompasses most
updates, since most updates originate from an event handler like
`onClick` or `onChange`. It also includes updates triggered by lifecycle
methods or effects. But there are also updates that originate outside
React's event system, like timer events, network events, and microtasks
(promise resolution handlers). These are not batched, which results in
both worse performance (multiple render passes instead of single one)
and confusing semantics.

Ideally all updates would be batched by default. Unfortunately, it's
easy for components to accidentally rely on this behavior, so changing
it could break existing apps in subtle ways.

One way to move to a batched-by-default model is to opt into Concurrent
Mode (still experimental). But Concurrent Mode introduces additional
semantic changes that apps may not be ready to adopt.

This commit introduces an additional mode called Batched Mode. Batched
Mode enables a batched-by-default model that defers all updates to the
next React event. Once it begins rendering, React will not yield to
the browser until the entire render is finished.

Batched Mode is superset of Strict Mode. It fires all the same warnings.
It also drops the forked Suspense behavior used by Legacy Mode, in favor
of the proper semantics used by Concurrent Mode.

I have not added any public APIs that expose the new mode yet. I'll do
that in subsequent commits.

* Suspense in Batched Mode

Should have same semantics as Concurrent Mode.

* Use RootTag field to configure type of root

There are three types of roots: Legacy, Batched, and Concurrent.

* flushSync should not flush batched work

Treat Sync and Batched expiration times separately. Only Sync updates
are pushed to our internal queue of synchronous callbacks.

Renamed `flushImmediateQueue` to `flushSyncCallbackQueue` for clarity."

* Don't consider ""Never"" expiration as part of most recent event time

This doesn't happen with deprioritization since those are not ""updates""
by themselves so they don't go into this accounting.

However, they are real updates if they were scheduled as Idle pri using
the scheduler explicitly. It's unclear what suspense should do for these
updates. For offscreen work, we probably want them to commit immediately.
No point in delay them since they're offscreen anyway. However if this is
an explicit but very low priority update that might not make sense.
So maybe this means that these should have different expiration times?

In this PR I just set the suspense to the lowest JND.

However, we don't want is for these things to commit earlier in case
they got batched in with other work so I also ensured that they're not
accounted for in in the workInProgressRootMostRecentEventTime calculation
at all. This makes them commit immediately if they're by themselves, or
after the JND of whatever they were batched in with.

Ultimately, I think that we should probably never schedule anything at
Never that isn't truly offscreen so this should never happen.

However, that begs the question what happens with very low pri work that
suspends. Do we always work at that level first?

* Warn when suspending at wrong priority

Adds a warning when a user-blocking update is suspended.

Ideally, all we would need to do is check the current priority level.
But we currently have no rigorous way to distinguish work that was
scheduled at user- blocking priority from work that expired a bit and
was ""upgraded"" to a higher priority. That's because we don't schedule
separate callbacks for every level, only the highest priority level per
root. The priority of subsequent levels is inferred from the expiration
time, but this is an imprecise heuristic.

However, we do store the last discrete pending update per root. So we
can reliably compare to that one. (If we broaden this warning to include
high pri updates that aren't discrete, then this won't be sufficient.)

My rationale is that it's better for this warning to have false
negatives than false positives.

Potential follow-ups:
- Bikeshed more on the message. I don't like what I landed on that much
but I think it's good enough to start.
- Include the names of the components that updated. (The ideal place to
fire the warning is during the setState call but we don't know if
something will suspend until the next update. Maybe we could be clever
and warn during a subsequent update to the same component?)

* Move Suspense priority check to throwException"

Fixes https://github.com/bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental/issues/217

The error reproduces with any two React websites, e.g. `https://reactjs.org` and `https://nextjs.org`, by keeping the DevTools Components tab open and switching between these websites in the same browser tab.

There are several issues with the code that contribute to this:
1. `Bridge` leaves behind a dangling timer that fires `_flush` after the bridge has been abandoned (""shutdown"").
2. `bridge.send('shutdown')` is asynchronous, so the event handlers do not get unsubscribed in time.
3. `port.onDisconnect` does not trigger on in-tab navigation like new URL or back/forward navigation.
4. State management design of the code that uses shared variables and callbacks makes it hard to handle race conditions originating from the browser.

This commit cleans up some of the lacking symmetry when using `addListener`/`removeListener`, but the code in `shells/browser/shared/src/main.js` is hard to reason about with regards to race conditions, and there are many possible race conditions originating from the browser, so maybe there could be a better design paradigm (like a formal state machine) to manage the state changes in response to sequences of events than plain old event listeners, callbacks, and shared variables.

Unrelated, but clicking Chrome Back/Forward/Back/Forward very fast makes the browser and the DevTools and the DevTools of DevTools stall and become unresponsive for some time, then recovers but the Back/Forward/Stop/Refresh button and favicon loading indicator may remain broken. Looks like a Chrome bug, some kind of a temporary deadlock in handling the browser history."

Bugfix for `inferPriorityFromExpirationTime` function. It happened to
work in our existing tests because we use virtual time.

Flow would have caught this if expiration times were an opaque type. We
should consider that in the future. (The downside of opaque types is
that all operations would have to go through helper functions, which may
or may not get inlined by Closure.)"

Fixes a bug where the timeout passed to `scheduleCallback` represented
an absolute timestamp, instead of the amount of time until that
timestamp is reached. The solution is to subtract the current time
from the expiration.

The bug wasn't caught by other tests because we use virtual times that
default to 0, and most tests don't advance time.

I also moved the `initialTimeMs` offset to the
`SchedulerWithReactIntegration` module so that we don't have to remember
to subtract the offset every time. (We should consider upstreaming this
to the Scheduler package.)"

The implementation is wrong, but also it's not that useful for

I'll just remove it."

Refactor of Press and additional regression coverage.

The logic for ""start"", ""move"", ""end"", and ""cancel"" events is consolidated into a single block to reduce duplication and improve consistency of the UX across input-types. Also reduces code size.

The bailout logic for anchor tags is removed since we preventDefault for click by default. We can discuss scenarios where it makes sense to limit functionality around interactions on anchor tags.

The logic for ignoring emulated events is simplified and improved. Pointer events can produce emulated touch (immediately after pointer) and mouse events (delayed) which is now accounted for and tested."

* [React Native] Add tests to paper renderer for measure, measureLayout

* [React Native] measure calls will now call FabricUIManager

The Fabric renderer was previously calling the paper UIManager's measure calls and passing the react tag. This PR changes the renderer to now call FabricUIManager passing the node instead.

One of the parts of this that feels more controversial is making NativeMethodsMixin and ReactNative.NativeComponent warn when calling measureLayout in Fabric. As Seb and I decided in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15126, it doesn't make sense for a component created with one of these methods to require a native ref but not work the other way around. For example: a.measureLayout(b) might work but b.measureLayout(a) wouldn't. We figure we should keep these consistent and continue migrating things off of NativeMethodsMixin and NativeComponent.

If this becomes problematic for the Fabric rollout then we should revisit this.

* Fixing Flow

* Add FabricUIManager to externals for paper renderer

* import * as FabricUIManager from 'FabricUIManager';

* Update tests

* Shouldn't have removed UIManager import

* Update with the new tests"

When an async update expires, React renders at the expiration time that
corresponds to the current time, not at the original update's expiration
time. That way, all the expired work in the tree is flushed in a
single batch.

This is implemented inside `renderRoot` by comparing the next render
expiration time to the current time. If the current time is later,
`renderRoot` will restart at the later time.

Because of poor factoring, the check is currently performed right before
entering the work loop. But the work loop is usually entered multiple
times in a single callback: each time a component throws or suspends.
This led to an infinite loop where React would detect that an update
expired, restart at the current time, make a bit of progress, suspend,
check for expired work again, and start the loop again.

I fixed this by moving the expired work check to the beginning of
`renderRoot`, so that it is not performed every time something suspends.
This isn't ideal, because you could technically still fall into a loop
if more than 10ms lapse in between exiting `renderRoot` and entering it
again. The proper fix is to lift the check outside of `renderRoot`
entirely so that the function can restart without checking for expired
work again. Since this is exceedingly unlikely (and this whole thing is
still behind a flag), I'll do the better fix in an already-planned
follow up to fork `renderRoot` into separate functions for sync and
async work."

* Rewrite ReactFiberScheduler

Adds a new implementation of ReactFiberScheduler behind a feature flag.
We will maintain both implementations in parallel until the new one
is proven stable enough to replace the old one.

The main difference between the implementations is that the new one is
integrated with the Scheduler package's priority levels.

* Conditionally add fields to FiberRoot

Some fields only used by the old scheduler, and some by the new.

* Add separate build that enables new scheduler

* Re-enable skipped test

If synchronous updates are scheduled by a passive effect, that work
should be flushed synchronously, even if flushPassiveEffects is
called inside batchedUpdates.

* Passive effects have same priority as render

* Revert ability to cancel the current callback

React doesn't need this anyway because it never schedules callbacks if
it's already rendering.

* Revert change to FiberDebugPerf

Turns out this isn't neccessary.

* Fix ReactFiberScheduler dead code elimination

Should initialize to nothing, then assign the exports conditionally,
instead of initializing to the old exports and then reassigning to the
new ones.

* Don't yield before commit during sync error retry

* Call Scheduler.flushAll unconditionally in tests

This took a while, but I'm happy I went through it. Some key moments - recursively flushing effects, flushing microtasks on each async turn, and my team's uncompromising philosophy on code reuse. Really happy with this. I still want to expand test coverage, and I have some more small related todos, but this is good to land. On to the next one. 

Soundtrack to landing this - https://open.spotify.com/track/0MF8I8OUo8kytiOo8aSHYq?si=gSWqUheKQbiQDXzptCXHTg

* hacked up act(async () => {...})

* move stuff around

* merge changes

* abstract .act warnings and stuff. all renderers. pass all tests.

* move testutils.act back into testutils

* move into scheduler, rename some bits

* smaller bundle

* a comment for why we don't do typeof === 'function'

* fix test

* pass tests - fire, prod

* lose actContainerElement

* tighter

* write a test for TestRenderer

it's an odd one, because not only does sync act not flush effects correctly, but the async one does (wut). verified it's fine with the dom version.

* lint

* rewrote to move flushing logic closer to the renderer

the scheduler's `flushPassiveEffects` didn't work as expected for the test renderer, so I decided to go back to the hack (rendering a dumb container) This also makes reactdom not as heavy (by a few bytes, but still).

* move it around so the delta isn't too bad

* cleanups

fix promise chaining
propagate errors correctly
test for thenable the 'right' way
more tests!
tidier!
ponies!

* Stray comment

* recursively flush effects

* fixed tests

* lint, move noop.act into react-reconciler

* microtasks when checking if called, s/called/calledLog, cleanup

* pass fb lint

we could have globally changed our eslint config to assume Promise is available, but that means we expect a promise polyfill on the page, and we don't yet. this code is triggered only in jest anyway, and we're fairly certain Promise will be available there. hence, the once-off disable for the check

* shorter timers, fix a test, test for Promise

* use global.Promise for existence check

* flush microtasks

* a version that works in browsers (that support postMessage)

I also added a sanity fixture inside fixtures/dom/ mostly for me.

* hoist flushEffectsAndMicroTasks

* pull out tick logic from ReactFiberScheduler

* fix await act (...sync) hanging

- fix a hang when awaiting sync logic
- a better async/await test for test renderer

* feedback changes

- use node's setImmediate if available
- a warning if MessageChannel isn't available
- rename some functions

* pass lint/flow checks (without requiring a Promise polyfill/exclusion)

* prettier

the prettiest, even.

* use globalPromise for the missed await warning

* __DEV__ check for didWarnAboutMessageChannel

* thenables and callbacks instead of promises, pass flow/lint

* tinier. better.

- pulled most bits out of FiberScheduler
- actedUpdates uses callbacks now

* pass build validation

* augh prettier

* golfing 7 more chars

* Test that effects are not flushed without also flushing microtasks

* export doesHavePendingPassiveEffects, nits

* createAct()

* dead code

* missed in merge?

* lose the preflushing bits

* ugh prettier

* removed `actedUpdates()`, created shared/actingUpdatesScopeDepth

* rearrange imports so builds work, remove the hack versions of flushPassiveEffects

* represent actingUpdatesScopeDepth as a tuple [number]

* use a shared flag on React.__SECRET...

* remove createAct, setup act for all relevant renderers

* review feedback

shared/enqueueTask

import ReactSharedInternals from 'shared/ReactSharedInternals';

simpler act() internals

ReactSharedInternals.ReactShouldWarnActingUpdates

* move act() implementation into createReactNoop

* warnIfNotCurrentlyActingUpdatesInDev condition check order"

performWork call which is an indication that this was a bad abstraction

Adds a feature flag `enableNewScheduler` that toggles between two
implementations of ReactFiberScheduler. This will let us land changes in
master while preserving the ability to quickly rollback.

Ideally this will be a short-lived fork. Once we've tested the new
scheduler for a week or so without issues, we will get rid of it. Until
then, we'll need to maintain two parallel implementations and run tests
against both of them. We rarely land changes to ReactFiberScheduler, so
I don't expect this will be a huge burden.

This commit does not implement anything new. The flag is still off and
tests run against the existing implementation.

Use `yarn test-new-scheduler` to run tests against the new one."

MDN has a list of methods for obtaining the window reference of an
iframe:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage#Syntax

fix(react-dom): check if iframe belongs to the same origin

Accessing the contentDocument of a HTMLIframeElement can cause the browser
to throw, e.g. if it has a cross-origin src attribute.
Safari will show an error in the console when the access results in ""Blocked a frame with origin"". e.g:

```javascript
try {
 $0.contentDocument.defaultView
} catch (err) {
  console.log('err', err)
}

> Blocked a frame with origin X from accessing a frame with origin Y. Protocols, domains, and ports must match.
> err – TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating '$0.contentDocument.defaultView')
```

A safety way is to access one of the cross origin properties: Window or Location
Which might result in ""SecurityError"" DOM Exception and it is compatible to Safari.

```javascript
try {
 $0.contentWindow.location.href
} catch (err) {
 console.log('err', err)
}

> err – SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin ""http://localhost:3001"" from accessing a cross-origin frame. Protocols, domains, and ports must match.

* Transform invariant to custom error type

This transforms calls to the invariant module:

```js
invariant(condition, 'A %s message that contains %s', adj, noun);
```

Into throw statements:

```js
if (!condition) {
  if (__DEV__) {
    throw ReactError(`A ${adj} message that contains ${noun}`);
  } else {
    throw ReactErrorProd(ERR_CODE, adj, noun);
  }
}
```

The only thing ReactError does is return an error whose name is set
to ""Invariant Violation"" to match the existing behavior.

ReactErrorProd is a special version used in production that throws
a minified error code, with a link to see to expanded form. This
replaces the reactProdInvariant module.

As a next step, I would like to replace our use of the invariant module
for user facing errors by transforming normal Error constructors to
ReactError and ReactErrorProd. (We can continue using invariant for
internal React errors that are meant to be unreachable, which was the
original purpose of invariant.)

* Use numbers instead of strings for error codes

* Use arguments instead of an array

I wasn't sure about this part so I asked Sebastian, and his rationale
was that using arguments will make ReactErrorProd slightly slower, but
using an array will likely make all the functions that throw slightly
slower to compile, so it's hard to say which way is better. But since
ReactErrorProd is in an error path, and fewer bytes is generally better,
no array is good.

* Hydration Fixture: Only load ReactDOMServer if it exists

Fixes an issue where the hydration fixture would try to load in
ReactDOMServer below version 14. In version 13, string markup methods
exist on the React namespace.

* DOM Fixtures: Use class component for App.js

This was breaking React 0.13.0.

* Hydration Fixture: better findDOMNode compatibility

This commit fixes an issue where the Hydration DOM fixture was
unusable in React 0.13.0 or lower because of newer API usage.

It fixes that by avoiding the use of refs to get the textarea
reference in the code editor component, using various versions of
findDOMNode as required.

* Hydration Fixture: Do not show dropdown for single-line errors

If an error showed for the hydration fixture, a detail element was
used even if no additional lines could display. In that case, this
commit changes the component such that it returns a div.

* Deeper React version support for hydration fixture

This commit adds support for versions 0.4.0 of React and higher for
the hydration fixture.

The DOM test fixtures themselves do not support down to React 0.4.0,
which would be exhaustive. Instead, the Hydration fixture can pick a
version to use for its own purposes. By default, this is the version
of React used by the fixtures.

In the process of doing this, I had to make some updates to the
renderer.html document associated with the hydration fixture, and I've
added some comments to better document the history of API changes."

is nothing to show. We need to get actual content on the screen soon.

be wrong.

Therefore, if we have no current and we're already at terminal fallback

* Don't mutate stateNode in appendAllChildren

We can't mutate the stateNode in appendAllChildren because the children
could be current.

This is a bit weird because now the child that we append is different
from the one on the fiber stateNode. I think this makes conceptual
sense, but I suspect this likely breaks an assumption in Fabric.

With this approach, we no longer need to clone to unhide the children,
so I removed those host config methods.

Fixes bug surfaced by fuzz tester. (The test case that failed was the
one that's already hard coded.)

Refs behave differently in persistent mode. I added a TODO to write
a persistent mode version of this test.

* Import Scheduler directly, not via host config

We currently schedule asynchronous tasks via the host config. (The host
config is a static/build-time dependency injection system that varies
across different renderers — DOM, native, test, and so on.) Instead of
calling platform APIs like `requestIdleCallback` directly, each renderer
implements a method called `scheduleDeferredCallback`.

We've since discovered that when scheduling tasks, it's crucial that
React work is placed in the same queue as other, non-React work on the
main thread. Otherwise, you easily end up in a starvation scenario where
rendering is constantly interrupted by less important tasks. You need a
centralized coordinator that is used both by React and by other
frameworks and application code. This coordinator must also have a
consistent API across all the different host environments, for
convention's sake and so product code is portable — e.g. so the same
component can work in both React Native and React Native Web.

This turned into the Scheduler package. We will have different builds of
Scheduler for each of our target platforms. With this approach, we treat
Scheduler like a built-in platform primitive that exists wherever React
is supported.

Now that we have this consistent interface, the indirection of the host
config no longer makes sense for the purpose of scheduling tasks. In
fact, we explicitly do not want renderers to scheduled task via any
system except the Scheduler package.

So, this PR removes `scheduleDeferredCallback` and its associated
methods from the host config in favor of directly importing Scheduler.

Most of the existing noop tests were unaffected, but I did have to make
some changes. The biggest one involved passive effects: previously, they
were scheduled on a separate queue from the queue that handles
rendering. After this change, both rendering and effects are scheduled
in the Scheduler queue. I think this is a better approach because tests
no longer have to worry about the difference; if you call `flushAll`,
all the work is flushed, both rendering and effects. But for those few
tests that do care to flush the rendering without the effects, that's
still possible using the `yieldValue` API.

Follow-up: Do the same for test renderer.

* Add new mock build of Scheduler with flush, yield API

Test environments need a way to take control of the Scheduler queue and
incrementally flush work. Our current tests accomplish this either using
dynamic injection, or by using Jest's fake timers feature. Both of these
options are fragile and rely too much on implementation details.

In this new approach, we have a separate build of Scheduler that is
specifically designed for test environments. We mock the default
implementation like we would any other module; in our case, via Jest.
This special build has methods like `flushAll` and `yieldValue` that
control when work is flushed. These methods are based on equivalent
methods we've been using to write incremental React tests. Eventually
we may want to migrate the React tests to interact with the mock
Scheduler directly, instead of going through the host config like we
currently do.

For now, I'm using our custom static injection infrastructure to create
the two builds of Scheduler — a default build for DOM (which falls back
to a naive timer based implementation), and the new mock build. I did it
this way because it allows me to share most of the implementation, which
isn't specific to a host environment — e.g. everything related to the
priority queue. It may be better to duplicate the shared code instead,
especially considering that future environments (like React Native) may
have entirely forked implementations. I'd prefer to wait until the
implementation stabilizes before worrying about that, but I'm open to
changing this now if we decide it's important enough.

* Remove ReactNoop.flushDeferredPri and flushUnitsOfWork

Some of our older tests worked by counting how many times React checked
whether it should yield to the main thread, instead of something
publicly observable like how many times a component is rendered.

Our newer tests have converged on a style where we push into a log and
make assertions on the log. This pattern is less coupled to the
implementation while still being sufficient to test performance
optimizations, like resuming (whenever we add that back).

This commit removes flushDeferredPri and flushUnitsOfWork and upgrades
the affected tests.

* Remove shouldYieldToRenderer indirection

This wrapper is no longer necessary."

As I prepare to refactor the Fiber scheduler, I've noticed some quirks
in our implementation. This PR addressed one of them.

---

There's no reason for a timed out Scheduler callback to check
`shouldYield`, because the value will always be false until the work
has completed. The `didTimeout` argument provides this information to
the callback so it can avoid the redundant checks.

React's existing check for whether a callback has timed out didn't make
any sense, but happened to work anyway. I don't think the wrongness of
the old implementation is observable via React APIs but it's
incoherent regardless."

* Basic partial hydration test

* Render comments around Suspense components

We need this to be able to identify how far to skip ahead if we're not
going to hydrate this subtree yet.

* Add DehydratedSuspenseComponent type of work

Will be used for Suspense boundaries that are left with their server
rendered content intact.

* Add comment node as hydratable instance type as placeholder for suspense

* Skip past nodes within the Suspense boundary

This lets us continue hydrating sibling nodes.

* A dehydrated suspense boundary comment should be considered a sibling

* Retry hydrating at offscreen pri or after ping if suspended

* Enter hydration state when retrying dehydrated suspense boundary

* Delete all children within a dehydrated suspense boundary when it's deleted

* Delete server rendered content when props change before hydration completes

* Make test internal

* Wrap in act

* Change SSR Fixture to use Partial Hydration

This requires the enableSuspenseServerRenderer flag to be manually enabled
for the build to work.

* Changes to any parent Context forces clearing dehydrated content

We mark dehydrated boundaries as having child work, since they might have
components that read from the changed context.

We check this in beginWork and if it does we treat it as if the input
has changed (same as if props changes).

* Wrap in feature flag

* Treat Suspense boundaries without fallbacks as if not-boundaries

These don't come into play for purposes of hydration.

* Fix clearing of nested suspense boundaries

* ping -> retry

* Move DEV-only function right above where it's used

I don't like looking at this top-level function #petty

* Use different dispatchers for functions & classes

Classes support readContext, but not any of the other dispatcher
methods. Function support all methods.

This is a more robust version of our previous strategy of checking
whether `currentlyRenderingFiber` is null.

As a next step, we can use a separate dispatcher for each phase of the
render cycle (mount versus update).

* Use separate dispatchers for mount and update

* Remove mount code from update path

Deletes mount-specific code from the update path, since it should be
unreachable. To continue supporting progressive enhancement (mounting
new hooks at the end of the list), we detect when there are no more
current hooks and switch back to the mount dispatcher. Progressive
enhancement isn't officially supported yet, so it will continue to warn.

* Factoring nits

* Fix Flow

Had to cheat more than I would like

* More Flow nits

* Switch back to using a special dispatcher for nested hooks in DEV

In order for this strategy to work, I had to revert progressive
enhancement support (appending hooks to the end). It was previously a
warning but now it results in an error. We'll reconsider later.

* Always pass args to updateState and updateReducer

Even though the extra args are only used on mount, to ensure
type consistency."

* Don't bother comparing constructor when deps are not provided

When no dependencies are passed to an effect hook, what we used to do is
compare the effect constructor. If there was no change, then we would
skip firing the effect. In practice, this is a useless optimization
because the constructor will always be different when you pass an inline
closure. And if you don't pass an inline closure, then you can't access
any props or state.

There are some edge cases where an effect that doesn't close over props
or state could be useful, like reference counting the number of mounted
components. But those are rare and can be addressed by passing an empty
array of dependencies.

By removing this ""optimization,"" we can avoid retaining the constructor
in the majority of cases where it's a closure that changes on
every render.

I made corresponding changes to the other hooks that accept
dependencies, too (useMemo, useCallback, and useImperativeHandle).

* Allow useReducer to bail out of rendering by returning previous state

This is conceptually similar to `shouldComponentUpdate`, except because
there could be multiple useReducer (or useState) Hooks in a single
component, we can only bail out if none of the Hooks produce a new
value. We also can't bail out if any the other types of inputs — state
and context — have changed.

These optimizations rely on the constraint that components are pure
functions of props, state, and context.

In some cases, we can bail out without entering the render phase by
eagerly computing the next state and comparing it to the current one.
This only works if we are absolutely certain that the queue is empty at
the time of the update. In concurrent mode, this is difficult to
determine, because there could be multiple copies of the queue and we
don't know which one is current without doing lots of extra work, which
would defeat the purpose of the optimization. However, in our
implementation, there are at most only two copies of the queue, and if
*both* are empty then we know that the current queue must be.

* Add test for context consumers inside hidden subtree

Should not bail out during subsequent update. (This isn't directly
related to this PR because we should have had this test, anyway.)

* Refactor to use module-level variable instead of effect bit

* Add test combining state bailout and props bailout (memo)"

* Memoize promise listeners to prevent exponential growth

Previously, React would attach a new listener every time a promise is
thrown, regardless of whether the same listener was already attached
during a previous render. Because React attempts to render every time
a promise resolves, the number of listeners grows quickly.

This was especially bad in synchronous mode because the renders that
happen when the promise pings are not batched together. So if a single
promise has multiple listeners for the same root, there will be multiple
renders, which in turn results in more listeners being added to the
remaining unresolved promises. This results in exponential growth in
the number of listeners with respect to the number of IO-bound
components in a single render.

Fixes #14220

* [Fizz] Add Flow/Jest/Rollup build infra

Add a new package for react-stream which allows for custom server renderer
outputs. I picked the name because it's a reasonable name but also
because the npm name is currently owned by a friend of the project.

The react-dom build has its own inlined server renderer under the
name `react-dom/fizz`.

There is also a noop renderer to be used for testing. At some point
we might add a public one to test-renderer but for now I don't want to have
to think about public API design for the tests.

* Add FormatConfig too

We need to separate the format (DOM, React Native, etc) from the host
running the server (Node, Browser, etc).

* Basic wiring between Node, Noop and DOM configs

The Node DOM API is pipeToNodeStream which accepts a writable stream.

* Merge host and format config in dynamic react-stream entry point

Simpler API this way but also avoids having to fork the wrapper config.

Fixes noop builds.

* Add setImmediate/Buffer globals to lint config

Used by the server renderer

* Properly include fizz.node.js

Also use forwarding to it from fizz.js in builds so that tests covers
this.

* Make react-stream private since we're not ready to publish

or even name it yet

* Rename Renderer -> Streamer

* Prefix react-dom/fizz with react-dom/unstable-fizz

* Add Fizz Browser host config

This lets Fizz render to WHATWG streams. E.g. for rendering in a
Service Worker.

I added react-dom/unstable-fizz.browser as the entry point for this.

Since we now have two configurations of DOM. I had to add another
inlinedHostConfigs configuration called `dom-browser`. The reconciler
treats this configuration the same as `dom`. For stream it checks
against the ReactFizzHostConfigBrowser instead of the Node one.

* Add Fizz Browser Fixture

This is for testing server rendering - on the client.

* Lower version number to detach it from react-reconciler version"

* Add a test for current defaultProps behavior in lazy

* Add a warning against definining defaultProps on the outer wrapper

* Warn about setting propTypes too

* Remove redundant async

* Validate propTypes for resolved lazy types

Note this only works for elements created after resolving. So it's not ideal. But it provides the best stack trace for those cases.

* Add a test for lazy(forwardRef()) propTypes check

* Validate memo() inner propTypes and warn about shadowing

* Add test verifying nested lazy is unsupported

* Change error wording to remove ""Promise elements""

* Improve error message for nested lazy() and add tests

* Validate propTypes for memo in the reconciler when necessary

* Add comments for why we're calling checkPropTypes

* Fix Flow and lint

* Undo unintentional formatting changes

* Remove unnecessary case (it is handled by function code path)

* Add test coverage for memo(fn.defaultProps).propTypes

* Test should be agnostic of where resolving happens

That's an implementation detail and we might want to change it later. Let's keep it easy by making tests just check that validation happened, not at which stage.

* Unify traversal logic in createElement

This moves all type traversal into createElement. When lazy resolves, we call createElement once to re-check.

* Match prod behavior for propTypes/defaultProps shims closer

* Revert ""Unify traversal logic in createElement""

* BUG: ReactPartialRenderer / New Context polutes mutable global state

The new context API stores the provided values on the shared context instance. When used in a synchronous context, this is not an issue. However when used in an concurrent context this can cause a ""push provider"" from one react render to have an effect on an unrelated concurrent react render.

I've encountered this bug in production when using renderToNodeStream, which asks ReactPartialRenderer for bytes up to a high water mark before yielding. If two Node Streams are created and read from in parallel, the state of one can polute the other.

I wrote a failing test to illustrate the conditions under which this happens.

I'm also concerned that the experimental concurrent/async React rendering on the client could suffer from the same issue.

* Use unique thread ID for each partial render to access Context

This first adds an allocator that keeps track of a unique ThreadID index
for each currently executing partial renderer. IDs are not just growing
but are reused as streams are destroyed.

This ensures that IDs are kept nice and compact.

This lets us use an ""array"" for each Context object to store the current
values. The look up for these are fast because they're just looking up
an offset in a tightly packed ""array"".

I don't use an actual Array object to store the values. Instead, I rely
on that VMs (notably V8) treat storage of numeric index property access
as a separate ""elements"" allocation.

This lets us avoid an extra indirection.

However, we must ensure that these arrays are not holey to preserve this
feature.

To do that I store the _threadCount on each context (effectively it takes
the place of the .length property on an array).

* Don't warn if an unmounted component is pinged

* Suspense fuzz tester

The fuzzer works by generating a random tree of React elements. The tree
two types of custom components:

- A Text component suspends rendering on initial mount for a fuzzy
  duration of time. It may update a fuzzy number of times; each update
  supsends for a fuzzy duration of time.
- A Container component wraps some children. It may remount its children
  a fuzzy number of times, by updating its key.

The tree may also include nested Suspense components.

After this tree is generated, the tester sets a flag to temporarily
disable Text components from suspending. The tree is rendered
synchronously. The output of this render is the expected output.

Then the tester flips the flag back to enable suspending. It renders the
tree again. This time the Text components will suspend for the amount of
time configured by the props. The tester waits until everything has
resolved. The resolved output is then compared to the expected output
generated in the previous step.

Finally, we render once more, but this time in concurrent mode. Once
again, the resolved output is compared to the expected output.

I tested by commenting out various parts of the Suspense implementation
to see if broke in the expected way. I also confirmed that it would have
caught #14133, a recent bug related to deletions.

* When a generated test case fails, log its input

* Moar fuzziness

Adds more fuzziness to the generated tests. Specifcally, introduces
nested Suspense cases, where the fallback of a Suspense component
also suspends.

This flushed out a bug (yay!) whose test case I've hard coded.

* Use seeded random number generator

So if there's a failure, we can bisect."

* [react-cache] Remove `cache` as argument to `read`

Updated is API is `Resource.read(key)` instead of
`Resource.read(cache, key)`.

The cache is read from context using `readContext`.

This also removes cache invalidation entirely (other than the default
LRU mechanism), as well as the ability to have multiple caches. We'll
add it back once `Context.write` lands and we can implement it the
right way.

Since there's now only a single cache (the global one), we don't
actually need to use context yet, but I've added a dummy context
anyway so the user gets an error if they attempt to read outside the
render phase.

Fixes #13777

As part of #11927 we introduced a regression by adding onclick handler
to the React root. This causes the whole React tree to flash when tapped
on iOS devices (for reasons I outlined in
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12989#issuecomment-414266839).

To fix this, we should only apply onclick listeners to portal roots. I
verified that my proposed fix indeed works by checking out our DOM
fixtures and adding regression tests.

Strangely, I had to make changes to the DOM fixtures to see the behavior
in the first place. This seems to be caused by our normal sites (and 
thus their React root) being bigger than the viewport:

![](http://cl.ly/3f18f8b85e91/Screen%20Recording%202018-10-05%20at%2001.32%20AM.gif)

An alternative approach to finding out if we're appending to a React
root would be to add a third parameter to `appendChildToContainer` based
on the tag of the parent fiber."

Previously, we were emptying root.pendingInteractionMap and permanently losing those interactions when applying an unrelated update to a tree that has no scheduled work that is waiting on promise resolution. (That is, one that is showing a fallback and waiting for the suspended content to resolve.)

The logic I'm leaving untouched with `nextRenderIncludesTimedOutPlaceholder` is *not* correct -- what we want is instead to know if *any* placeholder anywhere in the tree is showing its fallback -- but we don't currently have a better replacement, and this should unblock tracing with suspense again."

* Jest + test renderer helpers for concurrent mode

Most of our concurrent React tests use the noop renderer. But most
of those tests don't test the renderer API, and could instead be
written with the test renderer. We should switch to using the test
renderer whenever possible, because that's what we expect product devs
and library authors to do. If test renderer is sufficient for writing
most React core tests, it should be sufficient for others, too. (The
converse isn't true but we should aim to dogfood test renderer as much
as possible.)

This PR adds a new package, jest-react (thanks @cpojer). I've moved
our existing Jest matchers into that package and added some new ones.

I'm not expecting to figure out the final API in this PR. My goal is
to land something good enough that we can start dogfooding in www.

* pure

A higher-order component version of the `React.PureComponent` class.
During an update, the previous props are compared to the new props. If
they are the same, React will skip rendering the component and
its children.

Unlike userspace implementations, `pure` will not add an additional
fiber to the tree.

The first argument must be a functional component; it does not work
with classes.

`pure` uses shallow comparison by default, like `React.PureComponent`.
A custom comparison can be passed as the second argument.

Added some tests for the non-DOM version of Scheduler that is used
as a fallback, e.g. Jest. The tests use Jest's fake timers API:

- `jest.runAllTimers(ms)` flushes all scheduled work, as expected
- `jest.advanceTimersByTime(ms)` flushes only callbacks that expire
within the given milliseconds.

These capabilities should be sufficient for most product tests. Because
jest's fake timers do not override performance.now or Date.now, we
assume time is constant. This means Scheduler's internal time will not
be aligned with other code that reads from `performance.now`. For finer
control, the user can override `window._sched` like we do in our tests.
We will likely publish a Jest package that has this built in."

All of these features are based on features of React's internal
scheduler. The eventual goal is to lift as much as possible out of the
React internals into the Scheduler package.

Includes some renaming of existing methods.

- `scheduleWork` is now `scheduleCallback`
- `cancelScheduledWork` is now `cancelCallback`


Priority levels
---------------

Adds the ability to schedule callbacks at different priority levels.
The current levels are (final names TBD):

- Immediate priority. Fires at the end of the outermost currently
executing (similar to a microtask).
- Interactive priority. Fires within a few hundred milliseconds. This
should only be used to provide quick feedback to the user as a result
of an interaction.
- Normal priority. This is the default. Fires within several seconds.
- ""Maybe"" priority. Only fires if there's nothing else to do. Used for
prerendering or warming a cache.

The priority is changed using `runWithPriority`:

```js
runWithPriority(InteractivePriority, () => {
  scheduleCallback(callback);
});
```


Continuations
-------------

Adds the ability for a callback to yield without losing its place
in the queue, by returning a continuation. The continuation will have
the same expiration as the callback that yielded.


Wrapped callbacks
-----------------

Adds the ability to wrap a callback so that, when it is called, it
receives the priority of the current execution context."

* Refactor Schedule, remove React-isms

Once the API stabilizes, we will move Schedule this into a separate
repo. To promote adoption, especially by projects outside the React
ecosystem, we'll remove all React-isms from the source and keep it as
simple as possible:

- No build step.
- No static types.
- Everything is in a single file.

If we end up needing to support multiple targets, like CommonJS and ESM,
we can still avoid a build step by maintaining two copies of the same
file, but with different exports.

This commit also refactors the implementation to split out the DOM-
specific parts (essentially a requestIdleCallback polyfill). Aside from
the architectural benefits, this also makes it possible to write host-
agnostic tests. If/when we publish a version of Schedule that targets
other environments, like React Native, we can run these same tests
across all implementations.

* Add home component. Async load fixtures.

This commit adds a homepage to the DOM fixtures that includes browser
testing information and asynchronously loads fixtures.

This should make it easier to find DOM testing information and keep
the payload size in check as we add more components to the fixtures.

* Adds experimental hydration fixture

This commit adds a first pass at a fixture that makes it easier to
debug the process of hydrating static markup. This is not complete:

1. It needs to be verified across multiple browsers
2. It needs to render with the current version of react

Still, it at least demonstrates the idea. A fixture like this will
also be helpful for debugging change events for hydrated inputs, which
presently do not fire if the user changes an input's text before
hydration.

* Tweak select width

* Manually join extra attributes in warning

This prevents a bug where Chrome reports `Array(n)` where `n` is the
size of the array.

* Transform with buble

* Eliminate dependencies

* Pull in react-live for better editing

* Handle encoding errors, pass react version

* Load the correct version of React

* Tweaks

* Revert style change

* Revert warning update

* Properly handle script errors. Fix dom-server CDN loading

* Fix 15.x releases

* Use postMessage to reduce latency, support older browsers

This commit makes a few tweaks to support older browsers and updates
the code transition process to use window.postMessage. This avoids
loading React on every single change.

* Fix fixture renamespacing bug

* Gracefully fallback to textarea in React 14

* Replace buble with babel, react-live with codemirror

* Simplify layout to resolve production code-mirror issues

* Tweak height rules for code-mirror

* Update theme to paraiso

* Format Code.js

* Adjust viewport to fix CodeMirror resize issue in production build

* Eliminate react-code-mirror

* Improve error state. Make full stack collapsable

* Add link to license in codemirror stylesheet

* Make code example more concise

* Replace ""Hydrate"" with ""Auto-hydrate"" for clarity

* Remove border below hydration header

* Rename query function in render.js

* Use Function(code) to evaluate hydration fixture

For clarity, and so that the Fixture component does not need to be
assigned to the window, this commit changes the way code is executed
such that it evaluates using a Function constructor.

* Extend hydration fixture to fill width. Design adjustments

This commit extends the hydration fixture such that it takes up the
full screen view. To accomplish this, the container that wraps all
fixtures has been moved to the FixtureSet component, utilized by all
other fixtures.

* Improve error scroll state

* Lazy load CodeMirror together before executing

This commit fixes an issue where CodeMirror wouldn't layout correctly
in production builds because the editor executes before the stylesheet
loaded. CodeMirror needs layout information, and was rendering
off-screen without correct CSS layout measurements.

* Fix indentation on error message

* Do not highlight errors from Babel. Add setPrototypeOf polyfill

This commit fixes an error in Safari 7.1 where Chalk highlighted Babel
errors caused a crash when setPrototypeOf was called within the
library.

This is also an issue on IE9, however this fix does not resolve issues
in that browser.

* Increase resilience to bad errors in Hydration fixture

- Reverts highlighting change. Polyfilling Safari 7.1 is sufficient
- Do not render a details tag in IE9"

IE 11 parses & normalizes the style attribute as opposed to other
browsers. It adds spaces and sorts the properties in some
non-alphabetical order. Handling that would require sorting CSS
properties in the client & server versions or applying
`expectedStyle` to a temporary DOM node to read its `style` attribute
normalized. Since it only affects IE, we're skipping style warnings
in that browser completely in favor of doing all that work.

* Accept promise as element type

On the initial render, the element will suspend as if a promise were
thrown from inside the body of the unresolved component. Siblings should
continue rendering and if the parent is a Placeholder, the promise
should be captured by that Placeholder.

When the promise resolves, rendering resumes. If the resolved value
has a `default` property, it is assumed to be the default export of
an ES module, and we use that as the component type. If it does not have
a `default` property, we use the resolved value itself.

The resolved value is stored as an expando on the promise/thenable.

* Use special types of work for lazy components

Because reconciliation is a hot path, this adds ClassComponentLazy,
FunctionalComponentLazy, and ForwardRefLazy as special types of work.
The other types are not supported, but wouldn't be placed into a
separate module regardless.

* Resolve defaultProps for lazy types

* Remove some calls to isContextProvider

isContextProvider checks the fiber tag, but it's typically called after
we've already refined the type of work. We should get rid of it. I
removed some of them in the previous commit, and deleted a few more
in this one. I left a few behind because the remaining ones would
require additional refactoring that feels outside the scope of this PR.

* Remove getLazyComponentTypeIfResolved

* Return baseProps instead of null

The caller compares the result to baseProps to see if anything changed.

* Avoid redundant checks by inlining getFiberTagFromObjectType

* Move tag resolution to ReactFiber module

* Pass next props to update* functions

We should do this with all types of work in the future.

* Refine component type before pushing/popping context

Removes unnecessary checks.

* Replace all occurrences of _reactResult with helper

* Move shared thenable logic to `shared` package

* Check type of wrapper object before resolving to `default` export

* Return resolved tag instead of reassigning"

Originally, the idea was to time slice the traversal. This worked when

duplicate entries, that optimization no longer makes sense – we could

Following up on the changes I made in #13367, @gaearon suggest that
""safe"" could be read as necessary for security. To avoid misleading a
reader, I'm changing the name.

A few names where discussed in the previous PR. I think `ToStringValue`
makes sense since the value itself is not a string yet but an opaque
type that can be cast to a string. For the actual string concatenation,
I've used `toString` now to avoid confusion: `toStringValueToString`
is super weird and it's namespaced anyhow.

Definitely open for suggestions here. :) I'll wait until we wrap up
#13362 and take care of rebase afterwards."

* Improve soundness of ReactDOMFiberInput typings

This is an attempt in improving the soundness for the safe value cast
that was added in #11741. We want this to avoid situations like [this
one](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13362#discussion_r209380079)
where we need to remember why we have certain type casts. Additionally
we can be sure that we only cast safe values to string.

The problem was `getSafeValue()`. It used the (deprecated) `*` type to
infer the type which resulted in a passing-through of the implicit `any`
of the props `Object`. So `getSafeValue()` was effectively returning
`any`.

Once I fixed this, I found out that Flow does not allow concatenating
all possible types to a string (e.g `"""" + false` fails in Flow). To
fix this as well, I've opted into making the SafeValue type opaque and
added a function that can be used to get the string value. This is sound
because we know that SafeValue is already checked.

I've verified that the interim function is inlined by the compiler and
also looked at a diff of the compiled react-dom bundles to see if I've
regressed anything. Seems like we're good.

Internally the 'warning' module has some dependencies which we want to
avoid pulling in during the very early stages of initial pageload. It is
creating a cyclical dependency.

And we wanted to remove this dependency anyway, because this module
should be kept small and decoupled.

* Store list of contexts on the fiber

Currently, context can only be read by a special type of component,
ContextConsumer. We want to add support to all fibers, including
classes and functional components.

Each fiber may read from one or more contexts. To enable quick, mono-
morphic access of this list, we'll store them on a fiber property.

* Context.unstable_read

unstable_read can be called anywhere within the render phase. That
includes the render method, getDerivedStateFromProps, constructors,
functional components, and context consumer render props.

If it's called outside the render phase, an error is thrown.

* Remove vestigial context cursor

Wasn't being used.

* Split fiber.expirationTime into two separate fields

Currently, the `expirationTime` field represents the pending work of
both the fiber itself — including new props, state, and context — and of
any updates in that fiber's subtree.

This commit adds a second field called `childExpirationTime`. Now
`expirationTime` only represents the pending work of the fiber itself.
The subtree's pending work is represented by `childExpirationTime`.

The biggest advantage is it requires fewer checks to bailout on already
finished work. For most types of work, if the `expirationTime` does not
match the render expiration time, we can bailout immediately without
any further checks. This won't work for fibers that have
`shouldComponentUpdate` semantics (class components), for which we still
need to check for props and state changes explicitly.

* Performance nits

Optimize `readContext` for most common case"

* Suspending inside a constructor outside of strict mode

Outside of strict mode, suspended components commit in an incomplete
state, then are synchronously deleted in a subsequent commit. If a
component suspends inside the constructor, it mounts without
an instance.

This breaks at least one invariant: during deletion, we assume that
every mounted component has an instance, and check the instance for
the existence of `componentWillUnmount`.

Rather than add a redundant check to the deletion of every class
component, components that suspend inside their constructor and outside
of strict mode are turned into empty functional components before they
are mounted. This is a bit weird, but it's an edge case, and the empty
component will be synchronously unmounted regardless.

* Refactor ReactDebugCurrentFiber to use named exports

This makes the difference between it and ReactFiberCurrentFrame a bit clearer.

ReactDebugCurrentFiber is Fiber's own implementation.
ReactFiberCurrentFrame is the thing that holds a reference to the current implementation and delegates to it.

* Unify ReactFiberComponentTreeHook and ReactDebugCurrentFiber

Conceptually they're very related.

ReactFiberComponentTreeHook contains implementation details of reading Fiber's stack (both in DEV and PROD).
ReactDebugCurrentFiber contained a reference to the current fiber, and used the above utility.

It was confusing when to use which one. Colocating them makes it clearer what you could do with each method.

In the future, the plan is to stop using these methods explicitly in most places, and instead delegate to a warning system that includes stacks automatically. This change makes future refactorings simpler by colocating related logic.

* Rename methods to better reflect their meanings

Clarify which are DEV or PROD-only.
Clarify which can return null.

I believe the ""work in progress only"" was a mistake. I introduced it because I wasn't sure what guarantees we have around .return. But we know for sure that following a .return chain gives us an accurate stack even if we get into WIP trees because we don't have reparenting. So it's fine to relax that naming.

* Rename ReactDebugCurrentFiber -> ReactCurrentFiber

It's not completely DEV-only anymore.
Individual methods already specify whether they work in DEV or PROD in their names."

An infinite update loop can occur when an update is scheduled inside a
lifecycle method, which causes a re-render, which schedules another
update, and so on. Before the Fiber rewrite, this scenario resulted in a
stack overflow.

Because Fiber does not use the JavaScript stack, we maintain our own
counter to track the number of nested, synchronous updates. We throw an
error if the limit is exceeded.

The nested update limit is currently 1000. I chose this number
arbitrarily, certain that there was no valid reason for a component to
schedule so many synchronous re-renders.

I think we can go much lower. This commit decreases the limit to 50. I
believe this is still comfortably above the reasonable number of
synchronous re-renders a component may perform.

This will make it easier for developers to debug infinite update bugs
when they occur."

We can support components that suspend outside of an async mode tree
by immediately committing their placeholders.

In strict mode, the Timeout acts effectively like an error boundary.
Within a single render pass, we unwind to the nearest Timeout and
re-render the placeholder view.

Outside of strict mode, it's not safe to unwind and re-render the
siblings without committing. (Technically, this is true of error
boundaries, too, though probably not a huge deal, since we don't support
using error boundaries for control flow (yet, at least)). We need to be
clever. What we do is pretend the suspended component rendered null.*
There's no unwinding. The siblings commit like normal.

Then, in the commit phase, schedule an update on the Timeout to
synchronously re-render the placeholder. Although this requires an extra
commit, it will not be observable. And because the siblings were not
blocked from committing, they don't have to be strict mode compatible.

Another caveat is that if a component suspends during an async render,
but it's captured by a non-async Timeout, we need to revert to sync
mode. In other words, if any non-async component renders, the entire
tree must complete and commit without yielding.

* The downside of rendering null is that the existing children will be
deleted. We should hide them instead. I'll work on this in a follow-up."

* Prepare placeholders before timing out

While a tree is suspended, prepare for the timeout by pre-rendering the
placeholder state.

This simplifies the implementation a bit because every render now
results in a completed tree.

* Suspend inside an already timed out Placeholder

A component should be able to suspend inside an already timed out
placeholder. The time at which the placeholder committed is used as 
the start time for a subsequent suspend.

So, if a placeholder times out after 3 seconds, and an inner
placeholder has a threshold of 2 seconds, the inner placeholder will
not time out until 5 seconds total have elapsed."

**why make this change?:**
We are about to fix the schedule module so that it still runs even when

right now callbacks are not called when the tab is in the background.

* Fall back to 'setTimeout' when 'requestAnimationFrame' is not called

**what is the change?:**
If 'requestAnimationFrame' is not called for 100ms we fall back to
'setTimeout' to schedule the postmessage.

**why make this change?:**
When you start loading a page, and then switch tabs,
'requestAnimationFrame' is throttled or not called until you come back
to that tab. That means React's rendering, any any other scheduled work,
are paused.

Users expect the page to continue loading, and rendering is part of the
page load in a React app. So we need to continue calling callbacks.

**test plan:**
Manually tested using the new fixture test, observed that the callbacks
were called while switched to another tab. They were called more
slowly, but that seems like a reasonable thing.

Expiration times are computed by adding to the current time (the start

time has advanced between the first and second call.

In other words, because expiration times determine how updates are
batched, we want all updates of like priority that occur within the same
event to receive the same expiration time. Otherwise we get tearing.

We keep track of two separate times: the current ""renderer"" time and the
current ""scheduler"" time. The renderer time can be updated whenever; it
only exists to minimize the calls performance.now.

But the scheduler time can only be updated if there's no pending work,

* Inline fbjs/lib/emptyObject

* Explicit naming

* Compare to undefined

* Another approach for detecting whether we can mutate

Each renderer would have its own local LegacyRefsObject function.

While in general we don't want `instanceof`, here it lets us do a simple check: did *we* create the refs object?
Then we can mutate it.

If the check didn't pass, either we're attaching ref for the first time (so we know to use the constructor),
or (unlikely) we're attaching a ref to a component owned by another renderer. In this case, to avoid ""losing""
refs, we assign them onto the new object. Even in that case it shouldn't ""hop"" between renderers anymore.

* Clearer naming

* Add test case for strings refs across renderers

* Use a shared empty object for refs by reading it from React

* Remove string refs from ReactART test

It's not currently possible to resetModules() between several renderers
without also resetting the `React` module. However, that leads to losing
the referential identity of the empty ref object, and thus subsequent
checks in the renderers for whether it is pooled fail (and cause assignments
to a frozen object).

This has always been the case, but we used to work around it by shimming
fbjs/lib/emptyObject in tests and preserving its referential identity.
This won't work anymore because we've inlined it. And preserving referential
identity of React itself wouldn't be great because it could be confusing during
testing (although we might want to revisit this in the future by moving its
stateful parts into a separate package).

For now, I'm removing string ref usage from this test because only this is
the only place in our tests where we hit this problem, and it's only
related to string refs, and not just ref mechanism in general.

For every call to renderRoot, one of onFatal, onComplete, onSuspend,

will eventually be lifted into the renderer.

* Suspended high pri work forces lower priority work to expire early

If an error is thrown, and there is lower priority pending work, we
retry at the lower priority. The lower priority work should expire
at the same time at which the high priority work would have expired.
Effectively, this increases the priority of the low priority work.

Simple example: If an error is thrown during a synchronous render, and
there's an async update, the async update should flush synchronously in
case it's able to fix the error. I've added a unit test for
this scenario.

We originally forked rAF because we needed to pull in a particular
version of rAF internally at Facebook, to avoid grabbing the default
polyfilled version.

The longer term solution, until we can get rid of the global polyfill
behavior, is to initialize 'schedule' before the polyfilling happens.

Now that we have landed and synced
https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12900 successfully, we can
initialize 'schedule' before the polyfill runs.
So we can remove the rAF fork. Here is how it will work:

1. Land this PR on Github.
2. Flarnie will quickly run a sync getting this change into www.
3. We delete the internal forked version of
   'requestAnimationFrameForReact'.
4. We require 'schedule' in the polyfill file itself, before the
   polyfilling happens.

Flarnie will manually try the above steps locally and verify that things
work.

* Use native event dispatching instead of Simulate or SimulateNative

In #12629 @gaearon suggested that it would be better to drop usage of
`ReactTestUtils.Simulate` and `ReactTestUtils.SimulateNative`. In this
PR I’m attempting at removing it from a lot of places with only a few
leftovers.

Those leftovers can be categorized into three groups:

1. Anything that tests that `SimulateNative` throws. This is a property
   that native event dispatching doesn’t have so I can’t convert that
   easily. Affected test suites: `EventPluginHub-test`,
   `ReactBrowserEventEmitter-test`.
2. Anything that tests `ReactTestUtils` directly. Affected test suites:
   `ReactBrowserEventEmitter-test` (this file has one test that reads
    ""should have mouse enter simulated by test utils""),
    `ReactTestUtils-test`.
3. Anything that dispatches a `change` event. The reason here goes a bit
   deeper and is rooted in the way we shim onChange. Usually when using
   native event dispatching, you would set the node’s `.value` and then
   dispatch the event. However inside [`inputValueTracking.js`][] we
   install a setter on the node’s `.value` that will ignore the next
   `change` event (I found [this][near-perfect-oninput-shim] article
   from Sophie that explains that this is to avoid onChange when
   updating the value via JavaScript).

All remaining usages of `Simulate` or `SimulateNative` can be avoided
by mounting the containers inside the `document` and dispatching native
events.

Here some remarks:

1. I’m using `Element#click()` instead of `dispatchEvent`. In the jsdom
   changelog I read that `click()` now properly sets the correct values
   (you can also verify it does the same thing by looking at the
   [source][jsdom-source]).
2. I had to update jsdom in order to get `TouchEvent` constructors
   working (and while doing so also updated jest). There was one
   unexpected surprise: `ReactScheduler-test` was relying on not having
   `window.performance` available. I’ve recreated the previous
   environment by deleting this property from the global object.
3. I was a bit confused that `ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument()` does
   not render into the document 🤷‍

* Initial failing unit test for error handling in schedule

**what is the change?:**
see title

**why make this change?:**
Adding tests for the error handling behavior we are about to add. This
test is failing, which gives us the chance to make it pass.

Wrote skeletons of some other tests to add.

Unit testing this way is really hacky, and I'm also adding to the
fixture to test this in the real browser environment.

**test plan:**
Ran new test, saw it fail!

* Add fixture for testing error handling in scheduler

**what is the change?:**
Added a fixture which does the following -
logs in the console to show what happens when you use
`requestAnimationFrame` to schedule a series of callbacks and some of
them throw errors.

Then does the same actions with the `scheduler` and verifies that it
behaves in a similar way.

Hard to really verify the errors get thrown at the proper time without
looking at the console.

**why make this change?:**
We want the most authentic, accurate test of how errors are handled in
the scheduler. That's what this fixture should be.

**test plan:**
Manually verified that this test does what I expect - right now it's
failing but follow up commits will fix that.

* Handle errors in scheduler

**what is the change?:**
We set a flag before calling any callback, and then use a 'try/finally'
block to wrap it. Note that we *do not* catch the error, if one is
thrown. But, we only unset the flag after the callback successfully
finishes.

If we reach the 'finally' block and the flag was not unset, then it
means an error was thrown.

In that case we start a new postMessage callback, to finish calling any
other pending callbacks if there is time.

**why make this change?:**
We need to make sure that an error thrown from one callback doesn't stop
other callbacks from firing, but we also don't want to catch or swallow
the error because we want engineers to still be able to log and debug
errors.

**test plan:**
New tests added are passing, and we verified that they fail without this
change.

* Add more tests for error handling in scheduler

**what is the change?:**
Added tests for more situations where error handling may come up.

**why make this change?:**
To get additional protection against this being broken in the future.

**test plan:**
Ran new tests and verified that they fail when error handling fails.

* callSafely -> callUnsafely

* Fix bugs with error handling in schedule

**what is the change?:**
- ensure that we properly remove the callback from the linked list, even
if it throws an error and is timed out.
- ensure that you can call 'cancelScheduledWork' more than once and it
is idempotent.

**why make this change?:**
To fix bugs :)

**test plan:**
Existing tests pass, and we'll add more tests in a follow up commit.

* Unit tests for error handling with timed out callbacks

**what is the change?:**
More unit tests, to cover behavior which we missed; error handling of
timed out callbacks.

**why make this change?:**
To protect the future!~

**test plan:**
Run the new tests.

* Adds fixture to test timed out callbacks with scheduler

**what is the change?:**
See title

In the other error handling fixture we compare 'scheduleWork' error
handling to 'requestAnimationFrame' and try to get as close as possible.
There is no 'timing out' feature with 'requestAnimationFrame' but
effectively the 'timing out' feature changes the order in which things
are called. So we just changed the order in the 'requestAnimationFrame'
version and that works well for illustrating the behavior we expect in
the 'scheduleWork' test.

**why make this change?:**
We need more test coverage of timed out callbacks.

**test plan:**
Executed the fixture manually in Firefox and Chrome. Results looked
good.

* fix rebase problems

* make fixture compensate for chrome JS speed

* ran prettier

* Remove 'cancelled' flag on callbackConfig in scheduler, add test

**what is the change?:**
- Instead of using a 'cancelled' flag on the callbackConfig, it's easier
to just check the state of the callbackConfig inside
'cancelScheduledWork' to determine if it's already been cancelled. That
way we don't have to remember to set the 'cancelled' flag every time we
call a callback or cancel it. One less thing to remember.
- We added a test for calling 'cancelScheduledWork' more than once,
which would have failed before.

Thanks @acdlite for suggesting this in code review. :)

**why make this change?:**
To increase stability of the schedule module, increase test coverage.

**test plan:**
Existing tests pass and we added a new test to cover this behavior.

**what is the change?:**
In a recent PR we were referencing some global variables and storing
local references to them.

To make things more natural, we co-opted the original name of the global
for our local reference. To make this work with Flow, we get the
original reference from 'window.requestAnimationFrame' and assign it to
'const requestAnimationFrame'.

Sometimes React is used in an environment where 'window' is not defined
- in that case we need to use something else, or hide the 'window'
reference somewhere.

We opted to use 'global' thinking that Babel transforms would fill that
in with the proper thing.

But for some of our fixtures we are not doing that transform on the
bundle.

**what is the change?:**
See title

**why make this change?:**
This seems to make the code simpler, and potentially saves space of
having an array and object around holding references to the callbacks.

**test plan:**
Run existing tests

* minor style improvements

* refactor conditionals in cancelScheduledWork for increased clarity

* Remove 'canUseDOM' condition and fix some flow issues w/callbackID type

**what is the change?:**
- Removed conditional which fell back to 'setTimeout' when the
environment doesn't have DOM. This appears to be an old polyfill used
for test environments and we don't use it any more.
- Fixed type definitions around the callbackID to be more accurate in
the scheduler itself, and more loose in the React code.

**why make this change?:**
To get Flow passing, simplify the scheduler code, make things accurate.

**test plan:**
Run tests and flow.

* Rewrite 'cancelScheduledWork' so that Flow accepts it

**what is the change?:**
Adding verification that 'previousCallbackConfig' and
'nextCallbackConfig' are not null before accessing properties on them.

Slightly concerned because this implementation relies on these
properties being untouched and correct on the config which is passed to
'cancelScheduledWork' but I guess we already rely heavily on that for
this whole approach. :\

**why make this change?:**
To get Flow passing.

Not sure why it passed earlier and in CI, but now it's not.

**test plan:**
`yarn flow dom` and other flow tests, lint, tests, etc.

* ran prettier

* Put back the fallback implementation of scheduler for node environment

**what is the change?:**
We had tried removing the fallback implementation of `scheduler` but
tests reminded us that this is important for supporting isomorphic uses
of React.

Long term we will move this out of the `schedule` module but for now
let's keep things simple.

**why make this change?:**
Keep things working!

**test plan:**
Ran tests and flow

* Shorten properties stored in objects by sheduler

**what is the change?:**
`previousScheduledCallback` -> `prev`
`nextScheduledCallback` -> `next`

**why make this change?:**
We want this package to be smaller, and less letters means less code
means smaller!

**test plan:**
ran existing tests

* further remove extra lines in scheduler"

* Adding 'schedule' fixture

**what is the change?:**
We need to test the `schedule` module against real live browser APIs. As
a quick solution we're writing a fixture for using in manual testing.
Later we plan on adding automated browser testing, using this or a
similar fixture as the test page.

**why make this change?:**
To further solidify test coverage for `schedule` before making further
improvements/refactors to the module.

**test plan:**
`open fixtures/schedule/index.html` and inspect the results. It should
be clear that things pass.

We also temporarily broke the scheduler and verified that this fixture
demonstrates the problems.

**issue:**
Internal task T29442940

* Made fixture tests display red or green border depending on pass/fail

**what is the change?:**
Added red/green solid/dashed border for test results when using the
schedule fixture.

We also tweaked the timing of the last test because it was on the line
in terms of whether it passed or failed.

**why make this change?:**
To make it faster to use the fixture - it takes more time to read
through the results line by line and check that they match what is
expected.

**test plan:**
Looked at the fixture, and also tried modifying a test to show what it
looks like when something fails."

* Add a unit test for double-invoking form events

The case I added was wrong (just like including this event in the top level list was always wrong).

In fact it never bubbles, even for <img>. And since we don't special case it in the <img> event
attachment logic when we create it, we never supported <img onLoadStart> at all.

We could fix it. But Chrome doesn't support it either: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=458851.
Nobody asked us for it yet. And supporting it would require attaching an extra listener to every <img>.

So maybe we don't need it? Let's document the existing state of things.

* Extract base Jest config

This makes it easier to change the source config without affecting the build test config.

* Statically import the host config

This changes react-reconciler to import HostConfig instead of getting it through a function argument.

Rather than start with packages like ReactDOM that want to inline it, I started with React Noop and ensured that *custom* renderers using react-reconciler package still work. To do this, I'm making HostConfig module in the reconciler look at a global variable by default (which, in case of the react-reconciler npm package, ends up being the host config argument in the top-level scope).

This is still very broken.

* Add scaffolding for importing an inlined renderer

* Fix the build

* ES exports for renderer methods

* ES modules for host configs

* Remove closures from the reconciler

* Check each renderer's config with Flow

* Fix uncovered Flow issue

We know nextHydratableInstance doesn't get mutated inside this function, but Flow doesn't so it thinks it may be null.
Help Flow.

* Prettier

* Get rid of enable*Reconciler flags

They are not as useful anymore because for almost all cases (except third party renderers) we *know* whether it supports mutation or persistence.

This refactoring means react-reconciler and react-reconciler/persistent third-party packages now ship the same thing.
Not ideal, but this seems worth how simpler the code becomes. We can later look into addressing it by having a single toggle instead.

* Temporary fix for grabbing wrong rAF polyfill in ReactScheduler

**what is the change?:**
For now...
We need to grab a slightly different implementation of rAF internally at
FB than in Open Source. Making rAF a dependency of the ReactScheduler
module allows us to fork the dependency at FB.

NOTE: After this lands we have an alternative plan to make this module
separate from React and require it before our Facebook timer polyfills
are applied. But want to land this now to keep master in a working state
and fix bugs folks are seeing at Facebook.

Thanks @sebmarkbage @acdlite and @sophiebits for discussing the options
and trade-offs for solving this issue.

**why make this change?:**
This fixes a problem we're running into when experimenting with
ReactScheduler internally at Facebook, **and* it's part of our long term
plan to use dependency injection with the scheduler to make it easier to
test and adjust.

**test plan:**
Ran tests, lint, flow, and will manually test when syncing into
Facebook's codebase.

**issue:**
See internal task T29442940

To be fair, it's not clear how you can hit a problem with the current
state of things. Even if a callback is cancelled, it's still in the
'pendingCallbacks' queue until the rAF runs, and we only schedule a rAF
when there are pendingCallbacks in the queue.

But since this is obviously wrong, going to fix it.

We will be adding a regression test in a follow-up PR.

**what is the change?:**
```
rIC -> scheduleCallback
```
We will later expose a second method for different priority level, name
TBD. Since we only have one priority right now we can delay the
bikeshedding about the priority names.

cIC -> cancelScheduledCallback
This method can be used to cancel callbacks scheduled at any priority
level, and will remain named this way.

why make this change?:
Originally this module contained a polyfill for requestIdleCallback
and cancelIdleCallback but we are changing the behavior so it's no
longer just a polyfill. The new names are more semantic and distinguish
this from the original polyfill functionality.

**test plan:**
Ran the tests

**why make this change?:**
Getting this out of the way so things are more clear.

**Coming Up Next:**
- Switching from a Map of ids and an array to a linked list for storing
callbacks.
- Error handling

Fabric (secondary); React DOM (primary) and React ART (secondary).

* Timeout component

Adds Timeout component. If a promise is thrown from inside a Timeout component,
React will suspend the in-progress render from committing. When the promise
resolves, React will retry. If the render is suspended for longer than the
maximum threshold, the Timeout switches to a placeholder state.

The timeout threshold is defined as the minimum of:
- The expiration time of the current render
- The `ms` prop given to each Timeout component in the ancestor path of the
thrown promise.

* Add a test for nested fallbacks

Co-authored-by: Andrew Clark <acdlite@fb.com>

* Resume on promise rejection

React should resume rendering regardless of whether it resolves
or rejects.

* Wrap Suspense code in feature flag

* Children of a Timeout must be strict mode compatible

Async is not required for Suspense, but strict mode is.

* Simplify list of pending work

Some of this was added with ""soft expiration"" in mind, but now with our revised
model for how soft expiration will work, this isn't necessary.

It would be nice to remove more of this, but I think the list itself is inherent
because we need a way to track the start times, for <Timeout ms={ms} />.

* Only use the Timeout update queue to store promises, not for state

It already worked this way in practice.

* Wrap more Suspense-only paths in the feature flag

* Attach promise listener immediately on suspend

Instead of waiting for commit phase.

* Infer approximate start time using expiration time

* Remove list of pending priority levels

We can replicate almost all the functionality by tracking just five
separate levels: the highest/lowest priority pending levels, the
highest/lowest priority suspended levels, and the lowest pinged level.

We lose a bit of granularity, in that if there are multiple levels of
pending updates, only the first and last ones are known. But in practice
this likely isn't a big deal.

These heuristics are almost entirely isolated to a single module and
can be adjusted later, without API changes, if necessary.

Non-IO-bound work is not affected at all.

* ReactFiberPendingWork -> ReactFiberPendingPriority

* Renaming method names from ""pending work"" to ""pending priority""

* Get rid of SuspenseThenable module

Idk why I thought this was neccessary

* Nits based on Sebastian's feedback

* More naming nits + comments

* Add test for hiding a suspended tree to unblock

* Revert change to expiration time rounding

This means you have to account for the start time approximation
heuristic when writing Suspense tests, but that's going to be
true regardless.

When updating the tests, I also made a fix related to offscreen
priority. We should never timeout inside a hidden tree.

* Support using id to cancel scheduled callback

**what is the change?:**
see title

**why make this change?:**
Once we support multiple callbacks you will need to use the id to
specify which callback you mean.

**test plan:**
Added a test, ran all tests, lint, etc.

* ran prettier

* fix lint

* Use object for storing callback info in scheduler

* Wrap initial test in a describe block

* Support multiple callbacks in `ReactScheduler`

**what is the change?:**
We keep a queue of callbacks instead of just one at a time, and call
them in order first by their timeoutTime and then by the order which
they were scheduled in.

**why make this change?:**
We plan on using this module to coordinate JS outside of React, so we
will need to schedule more than one callback at a time.

**test plan:**
Added a boatload of shiny new tests. :)

Plus ran all the old ones.

NOTE: The tests do not yet cover the vital logic of callbacks timing
out, and later commits will add the missing test coverage.

* Heuristic to avoid looking for timed out callbacks when none timed out

**what is the change?:**
Tracks the current soonest timeOut time for all scheduled callbacks.

**why make this change?:**
We were checking every scheduled callback to see if it timed out on
every tick. It's more efficient to skip that O(n) check if we know that
none have timed out.

**test plan:**
Ran existing tests.

Will write new tests to cover timeout behavior in more detail soon.

* Put multiple callback support under a disabled feature flag

**what is the change?:**
See title

**why make this change?:**
We don't have error handling in place yet, so should maintain the old
behavior until that is in place.

But want to get this far to continue making incremental changes.

**test plan:**
Updated and ran tests.

* Hide support for multiple callbacks under a feature flag

**what is the change?:**
see title

**why make this change?:**
We haven't added error handling yet, so should not expose this feature.

**test plan:**
Ran all tests, temporarily split out the tests for multiple callbacks
into separate file. Will recombine once we remove the flag.

* Fix nits from code review

See comments on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12743

* update checklist in comments

* Remove nested loop which calls additional timed out callbacks

**what is the change?:**
We used to re-run any callbacks which time out whilst other callbacks
are running, but now we will only check once for timed out callbacks
then then run them.

**why make this change?:**
To simplify the code and the behavior of this module.

**test plan:**
Ran all existing tests.

* Remove feature flag

**what is the change?:**
see title

**why make this change?:**
Because only React is using this, and it sounds like async. rendering
won't hit any different behavior due to these changes.

**test plan:**
Existing tests pass, and this allowed us to recombine all tests to run
in both 'test' and 'test-build' modes.

* remove outdated file

* fix typo"

- In all tests where we previously mocked rIC or relied on native

- Also adds a basic initial test for ReactScheduler.
NOTE -> we do plan to write headless browser tests for ReactScheduler!
This is just an initial test, to verify that it works with the mocked
out browser APIs as expected.

**why make this change?:**
We need to mock out the browser APIs more completely for the new
'ReactScheduler' to work in our tests. Many tests are depending on it,
since it's used at a low level.

By mocking the browser APIs rather than the 'react-scheduler' module, we
enable testing the production bundles. This approach is trading
isolation for accuracy. These tests will be closer to a real use.

run the tests :)

* Decouple update queue from Fiber type

The update queue is in need of a refactor. Recent bugfixes (#12528) have
exposed some flaws in how it's modeled. Upcoming features like Suspense
and [redacted] also rely on the update queue in ways that weren't
anticipated in the original design.

Major changes:

- Instead of boolean flags for `isReplace` and `isForceUpdate`, updates
have a `tag` field (like Fiber). This lowers the cost for adding new
types of updates.
- Render phase updates are special cased. Updates scheduled during
the render phase are dropped if the work-in-progress does not commit.
This is used for `getDerivedStateFrom{Props,Catch}`.
- `callbackList` has been replaced with a generic effect list. Aside
from callbacks, this is also used for `componentDidCatch`.

* Remove first class UpdateQueue types and use closures instead

I tried to avoid this at first, since we avoid it everywhere else in the Fiber
codebase, but since updates are not in a hot path, the trade off with file size
seems worth it.

* Store captured errors on a separate part of the update queue

This way they can be reused independently of updates like
getDerivedStateFromProps. This will be important for resuming.

* Revert back to storing hasForceUpdate on the update queue

Instead of using the effect tag. Ideally, this would be part of the
return type of processUpdateQueue.

* Rename UpdateQueue effect type back to Callback

I don't love this name either, but it's less confusing than UpdateQueue
I suppose. Conceptually, this is usually a callback: setState callbacks,
componentDidCatch. The only case that feels a bit weird is Timeouts,
which use this effect to attach a promise listener. I guess that kinda
fits, too.

* Call getDerivedStateFromProps every render, even if props did not change

Rather than enqueue a new setState updater for every props change, we
can skip the update queue entirely and merge the result into state at
the end. This makes more sense, since ""receiving props"" is not an event
that should be observed. It's still a bit weird, since eventually we do
persist the derived state (in other words, it accumulates).

* Store captured effects on separate list from ""own"" effects (callbacks)

For resuming, we need the ability to discard the ""own"" effects while
reusing the captured effects.

* Optimize for class components

Change `process` and `callback` to match the expected payload types
for class components. I had intended for the update queue to be reusable
for both class components and a future React API, but we'll likely have
to fork anyway.

**what is the change?:**
Changes the expiration deadline from 500ms to 150ms, only in production.
In development it will still be 500ms.

I'm thinking we may want to change the 'bucket size' too, will look into
that a bit.

**why make this change?:**
We need to ensure interactions are responsive enough in order to gather
more test data on async. mode.

**test plan:**
No tests failed - where shall we add a test for this?

* Update user timing to record the timeout deadline with 'waiting' events

**what is the change?:**
When we are processing work during reconciliation, we have a ""timeout""
deadline to finish the work. It's a safety measure that forces things to
finish up synchronously if they are taking too long.

The ""timeout"" is different depending on the type of interaction which
triggered the reconciliation. We currently have a shorter ""timeout"" for
""interactive updates"", meaning we will try to finish work faster if the
reconciliation was triggered by a click or other user interaction.

For collecting more data in our logs we want to differentiate the
'waiting for async callback...' events based on the ""timeout"" so I'm
adding that to the logging.

One interesting note - in one of the snapshot tests the ""timeout"" was
super high. Going to look into that.

**why make this change?:**
Right now we are debugging cases where an interaction triggers a
reconciliation and the ""waiting for async callback...' events are too
long, getting blocked because the main thread is too busy. We are
keeping logs of these user timing events and want to filter to focus on
the reconciliation triggered by interaction.

**test plan:**
Manually tested and also updated snapshot tests.

These are based on the ReactNoop renderer, which we use to test React
itself. This gives library authors (Relay, Apollo, Redux, et al.) a way
to test their components for async compatibility.

- Pass `unstable_isAsync` to `TestRenderer.create` to create an async
renderer instance. This causes updates to be lazily flushed.
- `renderer.unstable_yield` tells React to yield execution after the
currently rendering component.
- `renderer.unstable_flushAll` flushes all pending async work, and
returns an array of yielded values.
- `renderer.unstable_flushThrough` receives an array of expected values,
begins rendering, and stops once those values have been yielded. It
returns the array of values that are actually yielded. The user should
assert that they are equal.

Although we've used this pattern successfully in our own tests, I'm not
sure if these are the final APIs we'll make public."

error boundary, like before. But rather than synchronously unmount the
children before retrying, we restart the failed subtree within the same
render phase. The failed children are still unmounted (as if all their
keys changed) but without an extra commit.

Commit phase errors are different. They work by scheduling an error on
the update queue of the error boundary. When we enter the render phase,
the error is popped off the queue. The rest of the algorithm is
the same.

This approach is designed to work for throwing non-errors, too, though
that feature is not implemented yet.

* Add experimental getDerivedStateFromCatch lifecycle

Fires during the render phase, so you can recover from an error within the same
pass. This aligns error boundaries more closely with try-catch semantics.

Let's keep this behind a feature flag until a future release. For now, the
recommendation is to keep using componentDidCatch. Eventually, the advice will
be to use getDerivedStateFromCatch for handling errors and componentDidCatch
only for logging.

* Reconcile twice to remount failed children, instead of using a boolean

* Handle effect immediately after its thrown

This way we don't have to store the thrown values on the effect list.

* ReactFiberIncompleteWork -> ReactFiberUnwindWork

* Remove startTime

* Remove TypeOfException

We don't need it yet. We'll reconsider once we add another exception type.

* Move replay to outer catch block

This moves it out of the hot path."

* Add test exercising public API to test BeforeInputEventPlugin + FallbackCompositionState

 - I've adopted a similar approach to the existing test for BeforeInputEventPlugin
 - I've simulated events and then assert the event handler for onBeforeInput is fired or not fired based on the test conditions
 - The scenarios are tested against IE11, Webkite and Presto environment simulations
 - I've encorporated what I understand to be the functionality in the FallbackCompositionState test

* Prettier

* Linting fixes

* Remove test for contenteditable in Presto - the contenteditable type is not supported in Presto powered browsers (Opera).

* Remove mention of Presto as this explicit condition is no longer handled in BeforeInputEventPlugin.

We still need to exercise usage of FallbackCompositionState though so let's keep a test where the env does not support Composition and Text events.

* Add tests for envs with only CompositionEvent support

* Remove internal tests no longer needed

* Shorten test case names to satisfy lint rules

* Add tests for onCompositionStart and onCompositionUpdte events

The BeforeInputEventPlugin is responsible for emitting these events so we need to add tests for this. This also ensure we exercise the code path that, L207, that was not previously exercised with the public tests."

* Updates inside controlled events (onChange) are sync even in async mode

This guarantees the DOM is in a consistent state before we yield back
to the browser.

We'll need to figure out a separate strategy for other
interactive events.

* Don't rely on flushing behavior of public batchedUpdates implementation

Flush work as an explicit step at the end of the event, right before
restoring controlled state.

* Interactive updates

At the beginning of an interactive browser event (events that fire as
the result of a user interaction, like a click), check for pending
updates that were scheduled in a previous interactive event. Flush the
pending updates synchronously so that the event handlers are up-to-date
before responding to the current event.

We now have three classes of events:

- Controlled events. Updates are always flushed synchronously.
- Interactive events. Updates are async, unless another a subsequent
event is fired before it can complete, as described above. They are
also slightly higher priority than a normal async update.
- Non-interactive events. These are treated as normal, low-priority
async updates.

* Flush lowest pending interactive update time

Accounts for case when multiple interactive updates are scheduled at
different priorities. This can happen when an interactive event is
dispatched inside an async subtree, and there's an event handler on
an ancestor that is outside the subtree.

* Update comment about restoring controlled components"

* ReactDOM.flushControlled

New API for wrapping event handlers that need to fire before React
yields to the browser. Previously we thought that flushSync was
sufficient for this use case, but it turns out that flushSync is only
safe if you're guaranteed to be at the top of the stack; that is, if
you know for sure that your event handler is not nested inside another
React event handler or lifecycle. This isn't true for cases like
el.focus, el.click, or dispatchEvent, where an event handler can be
invoked synchronously from inside an existing stack.

flushControlled has similar semantics to batchedUpdates, where if you
nest multiple batches, the work is not flushed until the end of the
outermost batch. The work is not guaranteed to synchronously flush, as
with flushSync, but it is guaranteed to flush before React yields to
the browser.

flushSync is still the preferred API in most cases, such as inside
a requestAnimationFrame callback.

* Test that flushControlled does not flush inside batchedUpdates

* Make flushControlled a void function

In the future, we may want to return a thenable work object. For now,
we'll return nothing.

* flushControlled -> unstable_flushControlled"

A new feature flag has been added, debugRenderPhaseSideEffectsForStrictMode. When enabled, StrictMode subtrees will also double-invoke lifecycles in the same way as debugRenderPhaseSideEffects.

By default, this flag is enabled for __DEV__ only. Internally we can toggle it with a GK.

This breaks several of our incremental tests which make use of the noop-renderer. Updating the tests to account for the double-rendering in development mode makes them significantly more complicated. The most straight forward fix for this will be to convert them to be run as internal tests only. I believe this is reasonable since we are the only people making use of the noop renderer."

* Put new context API behind a feature flag

We'll enable this in www only for now.

* Store nearest provider on context object

* Handle reentrancy in server renderer

Context stack should be per server renderer instance.

* Bailout of consumer updates using bitmask

The context type defines an optional function that compares two context
values, returning a bitfield. A consumer may specify the bits it needs
for rendering. If a provider's context changes, and the consumer's bits
do not intersect with the changed bits, we can skip the consumer.

This is similar to how selectors are used in Redux but fast enough to do
while scanning the tree. The only user code involved is the function
that computes the changed bits. But that's only called once per provider
update, not for every consumer.

* Store current value and changed bits on context object

There are fewer providers than consumers, so better to do this work
at the provider.

* Use maximum of 31 bits for bitmask

This is the largest integer size in V8 on 32-bit systems. Warn in
development if too large a number is used.

* ProviderComponent -> ContextProvider, ConsumerComponent -> ContextConsumer

* Inline Object.is

* Warn if multiple renderers concurrently render the same context provider

turns out that it's needed, we can fall back to backtracking the
fiber return path.

While writing tests for unsafe async warnings, I noticed that in certain cases, errors were swallowed by the toWarnDev matcher and resulted in confusing test failures. For example, if an error prevented the code being tested from logging an expected warning- the test would fail saying that the warning hadn't been logged rather than reporting the unexpected error. I think a better approach for this is to always treat caught errors as the highest-priority reason for failing a test.

* Added unsafe_* lifecycles and deprecation warnings
If the old lifecycle hooks (componentWillMount, componentWillUpdate, componentWillReceiveProps) are detected, these methods will be called and a deprecation warning will be logged. (In other words, we do not check for both the presence of the old and new lifecycles.) This commit is expected to fail tests.

* Ran lifecycle hook codemod over project
This should handle the bulk of the updates. I will manually update TypeScript and CoffeeScript tests with another commit.
The actual command run with this commit was: jscodeshift --parser=flow -t ../react-codemod/transforms/rename-unsafe-lifecycles.js ./packages/**/src/**/*.js

* Manually migrated CoffeeScript and TypeScript tests

* Added inline note to createReactClassIntegration-test
Explaining why lifecycles hooks have not been renamed in this test.

* Udated NativeMethodsMixin with new lifecycle hooks

* Added static getDerivedStateFromProps to ReactPartialRenderer
Also added a new set of tests focused on server side lifecycle hooks.

* Added getDerivedStateFromProps to shallow renderer

* Dedupe and DEV-only deprecation warning in server renderer

* Renamed unsafe_* prefix to UNSAFE_* to be more noticeable

* Added getDerivedStateFromProps to ReactFiberClassComponent

* Warn about UNSAFE_componentWillRecieveProps misspelling

* Added tests to createReactClassIntegration for new lifecycles

* Added warning for stateless functional components with gDSFP

* Added createReactClass test for static gDSFP

* Moved lifecycle deprecation warnings behind (disabled) feature flag

Updated tests accordingly, by temporarily splitting tests that were specific to this feature-flag into their own, internal tests. This was the only way I knew of to interact with the feature flag without breaking our build/dist tests.

* Tidying up

* Tweaked warning message wording slightly
Replaced 'You may may have returned undefined.' with 'You may have returned undefined.'

* Replaced truthy partialState checks with != null

* Call getDerivedStateFromProps via .call(null) to prevent type access

* Move shallow-renderer didWarn* maps off the instance

* Only call getDerivedStateFromProps if props instance has changed

* Avoid creating new state object if not necessary

* Inject state as a param to callGetDerivedStateFromProps
This value will be either workInProgress.memoizedState (for updates) or instance.state (for initialization).

* Explicitly warn about uninitialized state before calling getDerivedStateFromProps.
And added some new tests for this change.

Also:
* Improved a couple of falsy null/undefined checks to more explicitly check for null or undefined.
* Made some small tweaks to ReactFiberClassComponent WRT when and how it reads instance.state and sets to null.

* Improved wording for deprecation lifecycle warnings

* Fix state-regression for module-pattern components

* Bump deps to Jest 22

* Prevent jsdom from logging intentionally thrown errors

This relies on our existing special field that we use to mute errors.
Perhaps, it would be better to instead rely on preventDefault() directly.
I outlined a possible strategy here: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11098#issuecomment-355032539

* Update snapshots

* Mock out a method called by ReactART that now throws

* Calling .click() no longer works, dispatch event instead

* Fix incorrect SVG element creation in test

* Render SVG elements inside <svg> to avoid extra warnings

* Fix range input test to use numeric value

* Fix creating SVG element in test

* Replace brittle test that relied on jsdom behavior

The test passed in jsdom due to its implementation details.

The original intention was to test the mutation method, but it was removed a while ago.

Following @nhunzaker's suggestion, I moved the tests to ReactDOMInput and adjusted them to not rely on implementation details.

* Add a workaround for the expected extra client-side warning

This is a bit ugly but it's just two places. I think we can live with this.

* Only warn once for mismatches caused by bad attribute casing

We used to warn both about bad casing and about a mismatch.
The mismatch warning was a bit confusing. We didn't know we warned twice because jsdom didn't faithfully emulate SVG.

This changes the behavior to only leave the warning about bad casing if that's what caused the mismatch.
It also adjusts the test to have an expectation that matches the real world behavior.

* Add an expected warning per comment in the same test"

* Call and Return components should use ReactElement

ReactChildFiber contains lots of branches that do the same thing for
different child types. We can unify them by having more child types be
ReactElements. This requires that the `type` and `key` fields are
sufficient to determine the identity of the child.

The main benefit is decreased file size, especially as we add more
component types, like context providers and consumers.

This updates Call and Return components to use ReactElement. Portals are
left alone for now because their identity includes the host instance.

* Move server render invariant for call and return types

* Sort ReactElement type checks by most likely

* Performance timeline should skip over call components

Don't think these were intentionally omitted from the blacklist of
component types.

I went ahead and updated getComponentName to include special types, even
though I don't think they're used anywhere right now.

* Remove surrounding brackets from internal display names"

* Harden tests around init/addition/update/removal of aliased attributes

I noticed some patterns weren't being tested.

* Call setValueForProperty() for null and undefined

The branching before the call is unnecessary because setValueForProperty() already
has an internal branch that delegates to deleteValueForProperty() for null and
undefined through the shouldIgnoreValue() check.

The goal is to start unifying these methods because their separation doesn't
reflect the current behavior (e.g. for unknown properties) anymore, and obscures
what actually happens with different inputs.

* Inline deleteValueForProperty() into setValueForProperty()

Now we don't read propertyInfo twice in this case.

I also dropped a few early returns. I added them a while ago when we had
Stack-only tracking of DOM operations, and some operations were being
counted twice because of how this code is structured. This isn't a problem
anymore (both because we don't track operations, and because I've just
inlined this method call).

* Inline deleteValueForAttribute() into setValueForAttribute()

The special cases for null and undefined already exist in setValueForAttribute().

* Delete some dead code

* Make setValueForAttribute() a branch of setValueForProperty()

Their naming is pretty confusing by now. For example setValueForProperty()
calls setValueForAttribute() when shouldSetAttribute() is false (!). I want
to refactor (as in, inline and then maybe factor it out differently) the relation
between them. For now, I'm consolidating the callers to use setValueForProperty().

* Make it more obvious where we skip and when we reset attributes

The naming of these methods is still very vague and conflicting in some cases.
Will need further work.

* Rewrite setValueForProperty() with early exits

This makes the flow clearer in my opinion.

* Move shouldIgnoreValue() into DOMProperty

It was previously duplicated.

It's also suspiciously similar in purpose to shouldTreatAttributeValueAsNull()
so I want to see if there is a way to unify them.

* Use more specific methods for testing validity

* Unify shouldTreatAttributeValueAsNull() and shouldIgnoreValue()

* Remove shouldSetAttribute()

Its naming was confusing and it was used all over the place instead of more specific checks.
Now that we only have one call site, we might as well inline and get rid of it.

* Remove unnecessary condition

* Remove another unnecessary condition

* Add Flow coverage

* Oops

* Fix lint (ESLint complains about Flow suppression)

* Fix treatment of Symbol/Function values on boolean attributes

They weren't being properly skipped because of the early return.
I added tests for this case.

* Avoid getPropertyInfo() calls

I think this PR looks worse on benchmarks because we have to read propertyInfo in different places.
Originally I tried to get rid of propertyInfo, but looks like it's important for performance after all.

So now I'm going into the opposite direction, and precompute propertyInfo as early as possible, and then just pass it around.
This way we can avoid extra lookups but keep functions nice and modular.

* Pass propertyInfo as argument to getValueForProperty()

It always exists because this function is only called for known properties.

* Make it clearer this branch is boolean-specific

I wrote this and then got confused myself.

* Memoize whether propertyInfo accepts boolean value

Since we run these checks for all booleans, might as well remember it.

* Fix a crash when numeric property is given a Symbol

* Record attribute table

The changes reflect that SSR doesn't crash with symbols anymore (and just warns, consistently with the client).

* Refactor attribute initialization

Instead of using flags, explicitly group similar attributes/properties.

* Optimization: we know built-in attributes are never invalid

* Use strict comparison

* Rename methods for clarity

* Lint nit

* Minor tweaks

* Document all the different attribute types"

* Use defaultValue instead of setAttribute('value')

This commit replaces the method of synchronizing an input's value
attribute from using setAttribute to assigning defaultValue. This has
several benefits:

- Fixes issue where IE10+ and Edge password icon disappears (#7328)
- Fixes issue where toggling input types hides display value on dates
  in Safari (unreported)
- Removes mutationMethod behaviors from DOMPropertyOperations

* initialValue in Input wrapperState is always a string

* The value property is assigned before the value attribute. Fix related tests.

* Remove initial value tests in ReactDOMInput

I added these tests after removing the `value` mutation
method. However they do not add any additional value over existing
tests.

* Improve clarity of value checks in ReactDOMInput.postMountWrapper

* Remove value and defaultValue from InputWithWrapperState type

They are already included in the type definition for HTMLInputElement

* Inline stringification of value in ReactDOMInput

Avoids eagier stringification and makes usage more consistent.

* Use consistent value/defaultValue presence in postMountHook

Other methods in ReactDOMInput check for null instead of
hasOwnProperty.

* Add missing semicolon

* Remove unused value argument in ReactDOMInput test

* Address cases where a value switches to undefined

When a controlled input value switches to undefined, it reverts back
to the initial state of the controlled input.

We didn't have test coverage for this case, so I've added two describe
blocks to cover both null and undefined."

In the current implementation, pendingProps is null if there are no new
props since the last commit. When that happens, we bail out and reuse
the current props.

But it makes more sense to always set pendingProps to whatever the next
props will be. In other words, pendingProps is never null: it points to
either new props, or to the current props. Modeling it this way lets us
delete lots of code branches and is easier to reason about bail outs:
just compare the pending props to the current props."

API for batching top-level updates and deferring the commit.

- `root.createBatch` creates a batch with an async expiration time
  associated with it.
- `batch.render` updates the children that the batch renders.
- `batch.then` resolves when the root has completed.
- `batch.commit` synchronously flushes any remaining work and commits.

No two batches can have the same expiration time. The only way to
commit a batch is by calling its `commit` method. E.g. flushing one
batch will not cause a different batch to also flush."

* Add yarn test-bundles and yarn test-prod-bundles

Only files ending with -test.public.js are opted in (so far we don't have any).

* Fix error decoding for production bundles

GCC seems to remove `new` from `new Error()` which broke our proxy.

* Build production version of react-noop-renderer

This lets us test more bundles.

* Switch to blacklist (exclude .private.js tests)

* Rename tests that are currently broken against bundles to *-test.internal.js

Some of these are using private APIs. Some have other issues.

* Add bundle tests to CI

* Split private and public ReactJSXElementValidator tests

* Remove internal deps from ReactServerRendering-test and make it public

* Only run tests directly in __tests__

This lets us share code between test files by placing them in __tests__/utils.

* Remove ExecutionEnvironment dependency from DOMServerIntegrationTest

It's not necessary since Stack.

* Split up ReactDOMServerIntegration into test suite and utilities

This enables us to further split it down. Good both for parallelization and extracting public parts.

* Split Fragment tests from other DOMServerIntegration tests

This enables them to opt other DOMServerIntegration tests into bundle testing.

* Split ReactDOMServerIntegration into different test files

It was way too slow to run all these in sequence.

* Don't reset the cache twice in DOMServerIntegration tests

We used to do this to simulate testing separate bundles.
But now we actually *do* test bundles. So there is no need for this, as it makes tests slower.

* Rename test-bundles* commands to test-build*

Also add test-prod-build as alias for test-build-prod because I keep messing them up.

* Use regenerator polyfill for react-noop

This fixes other issues and finally lets us run ReactNoop tests against a prod bundle.

* Run most Incremental tests against bundles

Now that GCC generator issue is fixed, we can do this.
I split ErrorLogging test separately because it does mocking. Other error handling tests don't need it.

* Update sizes

* Fix ReactMount test

* Enable ReactDOMComponent test

* Fix a warning issue uncovered by flat bundle testing

With flat bundles, we couldn't produce a good warning for <div onclick={}> on SSR
because it doesn't use the event system. However the issue was not visible in normal
Jest runs because the event plugins have been injected by the time the test ran.

To solve this, I am explicitly passing whether event system is available as an argument
to the hook. This makes the behavior consistent between source and bundle tests. Then
I change the tests to document the actual logic and _attempt_ to show a nice message
(e.g. we know for sure `onclick` is a bad event but we don't know the right name for it
on the server so we just say a generic message about camelCase naming convention)."

The other (FiberErrorLogger) is mocked to silence its output. I'll look if there's some other way to achieve this.

* Move Jest setup files to /dev/ subdirectory

* Clone Jest /dev/ files into /prod/

It fails because the config is now passed to Jest explicitly.
But the test doesn't know about the config.

To fix this, we just run it via `yarn test` (which includes the config).
We already depend on Yarn for development anyway.

* Add yarn test-prod to run Jest with production environment

This produces a bunch of errors:

* Remove production switches from ReactErrorUtils

The tests now run in production in a separate pass.

* Add and use spyOnDev() for warnings

This ensures that by default we expect no warnings in production bundles.
If the warning *is* expected, use the regular spyOn() method.

This currently breaks all expectDev() assertions without __DEV__ blocks so we go back to:

We started using spyOnDev() for console warnings to ensure we don't *expect* them to occur in production. As a consequence, expectDev() assertions on console.error.calls fail because console.error.calls doesn't exist. This is actually good because it would help catch accidental warnings in production.

To solve this, we are getting rid of expectDev() altogether, and instead introduce explicit expectation branches. We'd need them anyway for testing intentional behavior differences.

This commit replaces all expectDev() calls with expect() calls in __DEV__ blocks. It also removes a few unnecessary expect() checks that no warnings were produced (by also removing the corresponding spyOnDev() calls).

Some DEV-only assertions used plain expect(). Those were also moved into __DEV__ blocks.

ReactFiberErrorLogger was special because it console.error()'s in production too. So in that case I intentionally used spyOn() instead of spyOnDev(), and added extra assertions.

This gets us down to:

Test Suites: 21 failed, 100 passed, 121 total
Tests:       72 failed, 26 skipped, 2458 passed, 2556 total
Snapshots:   16 failed, 4 passed, 20 total

* Enable User Timing API for production testing

We could've disabled it, but seems like a good idea to test since we use it at FB.

* Test for explicit Object.freeze() differences between PROD and DEV

This is one of the few places where DEV and PROD behavior differs for performance reasons.
Now we explicitly test both branches.

* Run Jest via ""yarn test"" on CI

* Remove unused variable

* Assert different error messages

* Fix error handling tests

This logic is really complicated because of the global ReactFiberErrorLogger mock.
I understand it now, so I added TODOs for later.

It can be much simpler if we change the rest of the tests that assert uncaught errors to also assert they are logged as warnings.
Which mirrors what happens in practice anyway.

* Fix more assertions

* Change tests to document the DEV/PROD difference for state invariant

It is very likely unintentional but I don't want to change behavior in this PR.

When we're rendering work at a specific level, and a higher priority
update comes in, we interrupt the current work and restart at the
higher priority. The rationale is that the high priority update is
likely cheaper to render that the lower one, so it's usually worth
throwing out the current work to get the high pri update on the screen
as soon as possible.

Currently, we also interrupt the current work if an update of *equal*
priority is scheduled. The rationale here is less clear: the only reason
to do this is if both updates are expected to flush at the same time,
to prevent tearing. But this usually isn't the case. Separate setStates
are usually distinct updates that can be flushed separately, especially
if the components that are being updated are in separate subtrees.

An exception is in Flux-like systems where multiple setStates are the
result of a single conceptual update/event/dispatch. We can add an
explicit API for batching in the future; in fact, we'd likely need one
anyway to account for expiration accidentally causing consecutive
updates to fall into separate buckets."

* Update Flow

* Fix createElement() issue

The * type was too ambiguous. It's always a string so what's the point?

Suppression for missing Flow support for {is: ''} web component argument to createElement() didn't work for some reason.
I don't understand what the regex is testing for anyway (a task number?) so I just removed that, and suppression got fixed.

* Remove deleted $Abstract<> feature

* Expand the unsound isAsync check

Flow now errors earlier because it can't find .type on a portal.

* Add an unsafe cast for the null State in UpdateQueue

* Introduce ""hydratable instance"" type

The Flow error here highlighted a quirk in our typing of hydration.
React only really knows about a subset of all possible nodes that can
exist in a hydrated tree. Currently we assume that the host renderer
filters them out to be either Instance or TextInstance. We also assume
that those are different things which they might not be. E.g. it could
be fine for a renderer to render ""text"" as the same type as one of the
instances, with some default props.

We don't really know what it will be narrowed down to until we call
canHydrateInstance or canHydrateTextInstance. That's when the type is
truly refined.

So to solve this I use a different type for hydratable instance that is
used in that temporary stage between us reading it from the DOM and until
it gets refined by canHydrate(Text)Instance.

* Have the renderer refine Hydratable Instance to Instance or Text Instance

Currently we assume that if canHydrateInstance or canHydrateTextInstance
returns true, then the types also match up. But we don't tell that to Flow.

It just happens to work because `fiber.stateNode` is still `any`.

We could potentially use some kind of predicate typing but instead
of that I can just return null or instance from the ""can"" tests.

This ensures that the renderer has to do the refinement properly."

**what is the change?:**
Adding a document linking to the Facebook Open Source Code of Conduct,
for visibility and to meet Github community standards.

**why make this change?:**
Facebook Open Source provides a Code of Conduct statement for all
projects to follow.

React already links to this Code of Conduct in the README, which is
great!

Exposing the COC via a separate markdown file is a standard being
promoted by Github via the Community Profile in order to meet their Open
Source Guide's recommended community standards.

As you can see, adding this file will complete [React's Community Profile](https://github.com/facebook/react/community)
checklist and increase the visibility of our COC.

**test plan:**
Viewing it on my branch -
(Flarnie will insert screenshot)

* Fix dead code elimination for feature flags

Turning flags into named exports fixes dead code elimination.

This required some restructuring of how we verify that flag types match up. I used the Check<> trick combined with import typeof, as suggested by @calebmer.

For www, we can no longer re-export `require('ReactFeatureFlags')` directly, and instead destructure it. This means flags have to be known at init time. This is already the case so it's not a problem. In fact it may be better since it removes extra property access in tight paths.

For things that we *want* to be dynamic on www (currently, only performance flag) we can export a function to toggle it, and then put it on the secret exports. In fact this is better than just letting everyone mutate the flag at arbitrary times since we can provide, e.g., a ref counting interface to it.

* Remove Task priority

The concept of Task priority was originally added as a way to avoid
reentrancy. Sync priority is for work that flushes synchronously, and
Task is for work that flushes at the end of the event loop.

But it turns out that in most cases, it's simpler to model Task and
Sync as the same priority level. For example, it's never correct to
flush Sync work from the update queue without flushing Task. Doing so
can lead to infinite update loops.

And using a separate priority level is not necessary to avoid
reentrancy. We already track when work is being rendered, and exit
before entering the render cycle again. That alone is sufficient.

This commit removes Task priority from the codebase. Now we use the
same level for both truly synchronous work and work that is deferred
until the end of the event loop.

This also enables us to remove DOM-specific legacy cases from the 
reconciler and lift them to the renderer.

* Remove isUnbatched from FiberRoot

Simpler to render unbatched roots immediately.

* Use a cyclic linked list for root schedule

Avoids the need for a separate `isScheduled` field."

This uncovered an interesting problem where ./b from package/src/a would resolve to a different instantiation of package/src/b in Jest.

Either this is a showstopper or we can solve it by completely fobbidding remaining /src/.

* Fix all tests

It seems we can't use relative requires in tests anymore. Otherwise Jest becomes confused between real file and symlink.
https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3830

This seems bad... Except that we already *don't* want people to create tests that import individual source files.
All existing cases of us doing so are actually TODOs waiting to be fixed.

So perhaps this requirement isn't too bad because it makes bad code looks bad.

Of course, if we go with this, we'll have to lint against relative requires in tests.
It also makes moving things more painful.

* Split performWork into renderRoot and commitRoot

It turns out that the scheduler is too coupled to how the DOM renderer
works. Specifically, the requestIdleCallback model, and how roots are
committed immediately after completing. Other renderers have different
constraints for when to yield and when to commit work.

We're moving towards a model where the scheduler only works on a single
root at a time, and the render phase and commit phase are split into
distinct entry points. This gives the renderer more control over when
roots are committed, coordinating multiple roots, deferring the commit
phase, batching updates, when to yield execution, and so on.

In this initial commit, I've left the renderers alone and only changed
the scheduler. Mostly, this involved extracting logic related to
multiple roots and moving it into its own section at the bottom of the
file. The idea is that this section can be lifted pretty much as-is
into the renderers. I'll do that next.

* Remove FiberRoot scheduleAt

Isn't actually used anywhere

* Make the root schedule a linked list again

Since this still lives inside the renderer, let's just use the
FiberRoot type. The FiberRoot concept will likely be lifted out
eventually, anyway.

* commitRoot should accept a HostRoot

This way it's less reliant on the alternate model

* Unify branches

* Remove dead branch

onUncaughtError is only called while we're working on a root.

* remainingWork -> remainingExpirationTime

I was wary of leaking NoWork but mixing numbers and null is worse so
let's just do it until we think of something better.

* Update build size

* [CS] Clone container instead of new root concept

The extra ""root"" concept is kind of unnecessary. Instead of having a
mutable container even in the persistent mode, I'll instead make the
container be immutable too and be cloned. Then the ""commit"" just becomes
swapping the previous container for the new one.

* Change the signature or persistence again

We may need to clone without any updates, e.g. when the children are changed.

Passing in the previous node is not enough to recycle since it won't have the
up-to-date props and children. It's really only useful to for allocation pooling.

* Implement persistent updates

This forks the update path for host fibers. For mutation mode we mark
them as having an effect. For persistence mode, we clone the stateNode with
new props/children.

Next I'll do HostRoot and HostPortal.

* Refine protocol into a complete and commit phase

finalizeContainerChildren will get called at the complete phase.
replaceContainer will get called at commit.

Also, drop the keepChildren flag. We'll never keep children as we'll never
update a container if none of the children has changed.

* Implement persistent updates of roots and portals

These are both ""containers"". Normally we rely on placement/deletion effects
to deal with insertions into the containers. In the persistent mode we need
to clone the container and append all the changed children to it.

I needed somewhere to store these new containers before they're committed
so I added another field.

* Commit persistent work at the end by swapping out the container

* Unify cloneOrRecycle

Originally I tried to make the recyclable instance nullable but Flow didn't
like that and it's kind of sketchy since the instance type might not be
nullable.

However, the real difference which one we call is depending on whether they
are equal. We can just offload that to the renderer. Most of them won't
need to know about this at all since they'll always clone or just create
new.

The ones that do know now have to be careful to compare them so they don't
reuse an existing instance but that's probably fine to simplify the
implementation and API.

* Add persistent noop renderer for testing

* Add basic persistent tree test

* Test bail out

This adds a test for bailouts. This revealed a subtle bug. We don't set the
return pointer when stepping into newly created fibers because there
can only be one. However, since I'm reusing this mechanism for persistent
updates, I'll need to set the return pointer because a bailed out tree
won't have the right return pointer.

* Test persistent text nodes

Found another bug.

* Add persistent portal test

This creates a bit of an unfortunate feature testing in the unmount
branch.

That's because we want to trigger nested host deletions in portals in the
mutation mode.

* Don't consider container when determining portal identity

Basically, we can't use the container to determine if we should keep
identity and update an existing portal instead of recreate it. Because
for persistent containers, there is no permanent identity.

This makes it kind of strange to even use portals in this mode. It's
probably more ideal to have another concept that has permanent identity
rather than trying to swap out containers.

* Clear portals when the portal is deleted

When a portal gets deleted we need to create a new empty container and
replace the current one with the empty one.

* Add renderer mode flags for dead code elimination

* Simplify ReactNoop fix

* Add new type to the host config for persistent configs

We need container to stay as the persistent identity of the root atom.
So that we can refer to portals over time.

Instead, I'll introduce a new type just to temporarily hold the children
of a container until they're ready to be committed into the permanent
container. Essentially, this is just a fancy array that is not an array
so that the host can choose data structure/allocation for it.

* Implement new hooks

Now containers are singletons and instead their children swap. That way
portals can use the container as part of their identity again.

* Update build size and error codes

* Address comment

* Move new files to new location"

* Put FB entry point for react-dom into packages/*

* Move src/renderers/testing/* into packages/react-test-renderer/src/*

Note that this is currently broken because Jest ignores node_modules,
and so Yarn linking makes Jest skip React source when transforming.

* Remove src/node_modules

* Add a hacky workaround for Jest/Workspaces issue

Jest sees node_modules and thinks it's third party code.

This is a hacky way to teach Jest to still transform anything in node_modules/react*
if it resolves outside of node_modules (such as to our packages/*) folder.

I created a separate test specifically for scryRenderedComponentsWithType() though because that was the only one.

Today, the only remaining special behavior for Jest mocks is we let them render undefined.

We don't plan to introduce any other special behavior for them in the future.
(In fact, we already decided against replicating this special behavior for functional components.)

Therefore, we can remove dependency on Jest automocking mechanism in these tests completely,

* Deterministic updates

High priority updates typically require less work to render than
low priority ones. It's beneficial to flush those first, in their own
batch, before working on more expensive low priority ones. We do this
even if a high priority is scheduled after a low priority one.

However, we don't want this reordering of updates to affect the terminal
state. State should be deterministic: once all work has been flushed,
the final state should be the same regardless of how they were
scheduled.

To get both properties, we store updates on the queue in insertion
order instead of priority order (always append). Then, when processing
the queue, we skip over updates with insufficient priority. Instead of
removing updates from the queue right after processing them, we only
remove them if there are no unprocessed updates before it in the list.

This means that updates may be processed more than once.

As a bonus, the new implementation is simpler and requires less code.

* Fix ceiling function

Mixed up the operators.

* Remove addUpdate, addReplaceState, et al

These functions don't really do anything. Simpler to use a single
insertUpdateIntoFiber function.

Also splits scheduleUpdate into two functions:

- scheduleWork traverses a fiber's ancestor path and updates their
  expiration times.
- scheduleUpdate inserts an update into a fiber's update queue, then
  calls scheduleWork.

* Remove getExpirationTime

The last remaining use for getExpirationTime was for top-level async
updates. I moved that check to scheduleUpdate instead.

* Move UpdateQueue insertions back to class module

Moves UpdateQueue related functions out of the scheduler and back into
the class component module. It's a bit awkward that now we need to pass
around createUpdateExpirationForFiber, too. But we can still do without
addUpdate, replaceUpdate, et al.

* Store callbacks as an array of Updates

Simpler this way.

Also moves commitCallbacks back to UpdateQueue module.

* CS renderer

Because we didn't have enough RN experiments. I want to add one more.

* Split out hydration from the host config object

This makes it easier to do feature detection on the configuration.

* Move mutation host config to separate optional object

* Refs and life-cycles should happen even in immutable mode

* Unmount components even in non-mutation mode

This is the same as committing deletions but instead of finding host
components to delete, it only invokes componentWillUnmount and detaching
of refs.

* Add persistent updates API

This mode will use a clone based API instead of mutating host instances.

Needs implementation still.

It's awkward that there can be more than one child inserted into the root.
So we need a new API to create a ""root"" instance so that we can update it
atomically. Alternatively we could keep the mutable API for containers

In sync mode, we downgrade sync priority work to task work when we're in
the commit phase, but not in the render phase. That means if you
schedule updates in both phases, the render phase update will flush
first, and the commit phase update will flush after that. What should
really happen is that both updates flush at the same time.

To solve this, updates in the commit phase are now given sync priority.
The distinction between task and sync really only exists to account for
a historical quirk in the behavior of top-level mounts. (Refer to the
test case titled ""initial mount is sync inside batchedUpdates"".)

Ideally, there would only be one priority for both sync and task. This
gets us closer to that model, while still accounting for
top-level mounts."

* [Work-in-progress] Assign expiration times to updates

An expiration time represents a time in the future by which an update
should flush. The priority of the update is related to the difference
between the current clock time and the expiration time. This has the
effect of increasing the priority of updates as time progresses, to
prevent starvation.

This lays the initial groundwork for expiration times without changing
any behavior. Future commits will replace work priority with
expiration times.

* Replace pendingWorkPriority with expiration times

Instead of a priority, a fiber has an expiration time that represents
a point in the future by which it should render.

Pending updates still have priorities so that they can be coalesced.

We use a host config method to read the current time. This commit
implements everything except that method, which currently returns a
constant value. So this just proves that expiration times work the same
as priorities when time is frozen. Subsequent commits will show the
effect of advancing time.

* Triangle Demo should use a class

shouldComponentUpdate was removed from functional components.

Running the demo shows, now that expiration is enabled, the demo does
not starve. (Still won't run smoothly until we add back the ability to
resume interrupted work.)

* Use a magic value for task expiration time

There are a few cases related to sync mode where we need to distinguish
between work that is scheduled as task and work that is treated like
task because it expires. For example, batchedUpdates. We don't want to
perform any work until the end of the batch, regardless of how much
time has elapsed.

* Use current time to calculate expiration time

* Add unit tests for expiration and coalescing

* Delete unnecessary abstraction

* Move performance.now polyfill to ReactDOMFrameScheduling

* Add expiration to fuzz tester

* Expiration nits

* Ignore SSR warning using explicit suppressHydrationWarning option

This lets you ignore the warning on a single element and its direct child
content. This is useful for simple fields that you're expecting to fail

Note that this still won't patch up such content so it'll remain
inconsistent. It's also not suitable for nested complex content that may
change.

want to do that in the normal hydrateTextInstance hooks since this is
only used in DEV. This is also in line with what happens if there is no
text instance at all and we invoke didNotFindHydratableTextInstance.

We heard from Chrome engineers that creating too many Range objects slows down Chrome because it needs to keep track of all of them for the case that anchor/focus nodes get removed from the document. We can just implement this calculation without ranges anyway.

jsdom doesn't support Range objects, but I copied the fuzz test code into my browser and manually compared it against our old implementation https://gist.github.com/sophiebits/2e6d571f4f10f33b62ea138a6e9c265c; with 200,000 trials no differences were found."

* [Gatsby docs a11y] Add `aria-label` to search input

**what is the change?:**
See title.

**why make this change?:**
There was no label on this input, and screen readers might not have been
able to identify it's purpose.
[The `placeholder` doesn't count as a label.](http://a11yproject.com/posts/placeholder-input-elements/)

**test plan:**
Manually inspected the HTML in the devtools, and ran the aXe a11y audit
tool, and the warning generated by aXe was gone.

**issue:**

* [Gatsby Docs a11y] Increase contrast of 'installation' page tabs

**what is the change?:**
Change the dark blue used for the text/background of the tabs on the
'installation' page to a slightly darker blue, which we were already
using for the 'focus' style of the tabs. It looked a bit weird before,
imo, when the 'focus' was darker.

Now the 'focus' style just lightens the border to the new signature
blue.

**why make this change?:**

To add enough contrast that folks who see colors differently can still
decipher the writing on the tabs on this page.

We plan to refactor this page and remove the tabs soon, so not too
worried about making this fix perfect.

**test plan:**
Manual testing - loaded the page and it looks ok, and ran aXe a11y
audit, no more warnings about contrast. :)

* Add a failing test that prints ""null"" in the warning instead of the stack

* Don't reset the current fiber during reconciliation

It should only be reset when we stop doing work.
Otherwise, any warnings after the reset will lose the component stack.

The reset in getMaskedContext() was completely unnecessary.
It is always called with the same fiber as the current work in progress.
Therefore, I add a DEV-only warning assertion to ensure we don't regress, and remove the reset.

The reset in processChildContext() is necessary because it can be called outside of reconciliation.
Unfortunately, we have to keep this hack in until we can remove unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer().
To work around it, I restore the previous fiber instead of resetting.

* Decouple setting the current fiber and phase

These are two distinct actions.
This helps make it clearer when we're actually changing the current pointer.

I'm also removing an overengineered hack I previously added for unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer. It's not necessary now that we don't null the pointer all the time.
This makes the code more straightforward.

`allowtransparency` is an Internet Explorer-only attribute that
controls the background transparency of an iFrame. When set to true,
it respects the background color of the iFrame. When set to false, it
sets the background color to that of the document.

This feature was removed in IE9 - falling out of React's support
commitment.

Developers that have somehow figured out how to get IE8 to work with
React 16.x can still use `allowtransparency=""true""`, since React now
supports unrecognized attributes.

Correct some grammar to be more explicit and clear. Update example CodePen to better match code found in documentation. Update code example styles to match other code examples (ie. 'State and Lifecycle', 'Handling Events').

* Clean up comment to be accurate to example

There was a small comment overlooked when reviewing the documentation. This fixes it to be accurate to the example as well as grammatically correct.

* Update portals.md

* First shot at updating changelog for 16.0

**what is the change?:**
Added an 'unreleased' section to the changelog with info from https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10294

**why make this change?:**
To get things set for the 16.0 release.

**test plan:**
Visual inspection

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Fix typos and formatting errors in changelog

* Add requestAnimationFrame and remove ""New helpful warnings""

**what is the change?:**
In response to helpful code review -
- Add mention of dependency on `requestAnimationFrame` and need to
  polyfill that as well as `Map` and `Set`
- Remove ""New helpful warnings"" section; it was incomplete, and there
  are so many new and updated warnings that it might not be reasonable
  to cover them in the changelog.

**why make this change?:**
Accuracy

**test plan:**
Visual inspection

**issue:**
issue #8854

* Improve wording

* Improve wording and fix missing links

* Add backticks to file names & code; wording tweak

* Break ""Major Changes"" into ""New Feature"" and ""Breaking Changes""

* Add server side render changes to 16.0 changelog

* Change gist link from mine to gaearons

* Add note about returning fragments

* fix misc nits

* Misc. formatting/wording fixes to changelog

**what is the change?:**
Thanks to the kind code review comments of @gaearon and @nhunzaker we
have
- removed the non-deterministic bold styling on some bullet points
- improved wording of the bullet points for portals, attribute whitelist
  changes, and server rendering changes
- Add note about error boundaries including a breaking change to error
  handling behavior.
- punctuation and capitalization fixes

**why make this change?:**
Clarity and correctness

**test plan:**
Visual inspection

After realizing this was the second time I've visited this exact page within a year and second guessing myself that the `textInput` ref isn't actually the `<input />` element. I decided to attempt to make this a little more explicit; you are actually accessing the method on the child class and not the `focus` method on the dom input element. Having them named the same caused some confusion."

* WIP

* WIP Add the rest of the tests for what we expect re: unknown attributes

**what is the change?:**
Adds tests for the following behavior -

- Numbers and booleans should be converted to strings, and not warn
- NaN, Symbols, functions, and objects should be converted to strings,
  and *should* warn

Going to add tests for the not-warning behavior in a follow-up.

These tests are not entirely passing - we either need to change what we
expect or change the behavior.

**why make this change?:**
Gets everyone on the same page about expected behavior, and codifies it
in a maintainable way

**test plan:**
`yarn test src/renderers/dom/shared/__tests__/ReactDOMAttribute-test.js`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10399

* WIP Add check that we *don't* warn when handling some unknown attributes

**what is the change?:**
We are testing the behavior of unknown attributes, which has changed
since React 15.

We want to *not* warn for the following cases -
- null
- undefined
- missing
- strings
- numbers
- booleans

**why make this change?:**
We want to verify that warnings don't get fired at the wrong time.

**test plan:**
`yarn test src/renderers/dom/shared/__tests__/ReactDOMAttribute-test.js`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10399

* ran prettier

* Symbols and functions passed to unknown attributes should remove and warn

* Abstract tests a bit to make them easier to read

* Remove Markdown from test names

I don't think we use this convention anywhere.

* Add an assertion for NaN warning message

* Update ReactDOMAttribute test based on attribute fixture

**what is the change?:**
- booleans don't get stringified
- some warnings have changed since we originally wrote this

**why make this change?:**
The attribute behavior is finalized and now we can test it :D

I also found it handy to have a row with a truly unknown attribute, so
added ""imaginaryFriend"".

**test plan:**
`yarn test src/renderers/dom/shared/__tests__/ReactDOMAttribute-test.js`
and comparing the tests to the attribute table

**issue:**

**why make this change?:**

**what is the change?:**
- switched from `Object.defineProperties` to `Object.defineProperty`
- set some undefined properties to get flow to pass

**why make this change?:**
- Flow doesn't seem to play nicely with `Object.defineProperty/ies`
  calls, specifically when you implement `get` and `set` methods.
  See https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/1336
- Switched from `properties` to `property` because it seems more
  conventional in our codebase to use `property`, and I'm only setting
  one anyway.

**test plan:**
`flow`

**issue:**
no issue

* More flow type tweaking

**what is the change?:**
Forced the typing of an argument to 'Object.defineProperty' to be

* Throw error to warn of mistaken loading of prod + dev React bundles

**what is the change?:**
Credit to @gaearon for coming up with a clever way to check for this. :)

I mainly just did the manual testing and fixed a couple of typos in his
idea.

I'd like to do a follow-up PR to add a link and a page explaining this
issue more and suggesting how to fix it.

**why make this change?:**

We want to warn for an unfortunate gotcha for
the following situation -
1. Wanting to shrink their JS bundle, an engineer runs it through
   'uglifyjs' or some other minifier. They assume this will also do
   dead-code-elimination, but the 'prod' and 'dev' checks are not
   envified yet and dev-only code does not get removed.
2. Then they run it through browserify's 'envify' or some other tool to
   change all calls to 'process.env.NODE_ENV' to ""production"". This
   makes their code ready to ship, except the 'dev' only dead code is
   still in the bundle. Their bundle is twice as large as it needs to
   be, due to the dead code.

This was a problem with the old build system before, but with our new
build system output it's possible to detect and throw an informative
error in this case.

**test plan:**
1. run the build in react as usual; `yarn build`
2. manually run 'uglifyjs -mt' on 'build/packages/react/index.js' to
   simulate mistakenly minifying React before env variables are
   resolved, which skips dead code elimination.
3. run the fixtures build - `cd fixtures/packaging && node
   ./build-all.js && serve ../..`
4. Visit just the production browserify fixture -
   http://localhost:5000/fixtures/packaging/browserify/prod/
5. You should see the error thrown indicating this problem has occurred.
(Flarnie will insert a screenshot)
6. Do the above steps with NO uglifyjs step, and verify that no error is
   thrown. When there is no minification applied, we don't assume that
   this mix-up has occurred.
(Flarnie will insert a screenshot)

**issue:**
fixes #9589

* Remove extra 'prod' env. check and add link to docs in error message

**what is the change?:**
Based on helpful feedback from @gaearon
- removed outer check that `process.env.NODE_ENV` is ""production"" since
  we are only calling the `testMinification` method inside of another
  check for ""production"" environment.
- Added an fburl that points to [our current docs on using the production version of React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build)

**why make this change?:**
To save an extra layer of conditionals and to make the error message
more clear.

**test plan:**
Same test plan as earlier -

1. run the build in react as usual; yarn build
2. manually run 'uglifyjs -mt' on 'build/packages/react/index.js' to
   simulate mistakenly minifying React before env variables are
   resolved, which skips dead code elimination.
3. run the fixtures build - cd fixtures/packaging && node ./build-all.js && serve ../..
4. Visit just the production browserify fixture -
   http://localhost:5000/fixtures/packaging/browserify/prod/
   You should see the error thrown indicating this problem has occurred.
   (Flarnie will insert a screenshot in comments on the PR)
6. Do the above steps with NO uglifyjs step, and verify that no error is thrown. When there is no minification applied, we don't assume that this mix-up has occurred.

* WIP fix and test 'testMinificationUsedDCE' method

**what is the change?:**
- Instead of looking for one match when having the method inspect it's
  own source, we look for two matches, because the search itself will be
  a match.
- WIP moving this method into another file and testing it.

Next steps:
- Figure out why the babel.transform call is not actually minifying the
  code
- Add tests for uglifyjs
- Update build process so that this file can be accessed from
  `packages/react/index.js`

**why make this change?:**
- We had a bug in the 'testMinification' method, and I thought the name
  could be more clear. I fixed the code and also changed the name.
- In order to avoid other bugs and keep this code working in the future
  we'd like to add a unit test for this method. Using the npm modules
  for 'uglifyjs' and 'babel'/'babili' we should be able to actually test
  how this method will work when minified with different configurations.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9589

* Add babeli and uglifyjs as dev-only dependencies

**what is the change?:**
See commit title

**why make this change?:**
In order to test that we are correctly detecting different minification
situations, we are using these modules in a test.

**test plan:**
NA

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9589

* Fix typo and add 'uglifyjs' tests

**what is the change?:**
There was a mix-up in the conditional in 'testMinificationUsedDCE' and
this fixes it.

The great new tests we added caught the typo. :)

Next steps:
- get the tests for 'babili' working
- update build scripts so that this the 'testMinificationUsedDCE'
  module is available from 'packages/react/index.js'

**why make this change?:**
We want to modularize 'testMinificationUsedDCE' and test it.

This verifies that the method warns when `uglifyjs` is used to minify
but dead code elimination is not done, in a production environment.
Generally this is a 'gotcha' which we want to warn folks aboug.

**test plan:**
`yarn test src/shared/utils/__tests__/testMinificationUsedDCE-test.js`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9589

* Run prettier

* var -> const/let

* Require specific version of `uglify-js`

**what is the change?:**
Removed the '^' from the npm package requirement

**why make this change?:**
I am seeing failures in CI that show `uglify-js` is returning different
output there from my local environment. To further debug this I'd like
to run CI with the exact same version of `uglify-js` that I am using
locally.

**test plan:**
push and see what CI does

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9589

* Add build step copying testMinificationUsedDCE into build/packages/react/cj

**what is the change?:**
This is a first step - we still need (I think) to process this file to
get it's contents wrapped in an 'iffe'.

Added a step to the build script which copies the source file for the
'testMinificationUsedDCE' module into the 'cjs' directory of our react
package build.

**why make this change?:**
We want this module to be available to the 'index.js' module in this
build.

**test plan:**
Will do manual testing once the build stuff is fully set up.

**issue:**

* Inline 'testMinificationUsedDCE' and remove unit test for now

What:
- Inlines the 'testMinificationUsedDCE' method into
  'packages/react/index.js'
- Removes unit test for 'testMinififcationUsedDCE'
- Puts dependencies back the way that they were; should remove extra
  dependencies that were added for the unit test.

Why:
- It would add complexity to the build process to add another file to
  the 'build/packages/react/cjs' folder, and that is the only way to
  pull this out and test it. So instead we are inlining this.

* Revert unintentional changes to dependency versions, variable placing

**what is the change?:**
- We had updated and added some dependencies, but ended up reverting
  this in a previous commit. The `yarn.lock` and `package.json` needed
  updated still though.
- There is a call to `Function.toString` which we wanted to wrap in a
  `try/catch` block.

**why make this change?:**
To remove unrelated dependency changes and increase the safety of the
`Function.toString` call.

**test plan:**
Manual testing again

The only module that uses FallbackCompositonState is BeforeInputEventPlugin. The way its structured means there can only be a single instance of FallbackCompositionState at any given time (stored in a local variable at the top-level) so we don't really need pooling here at all. Instead, a single object is now stored in FallbackCompositionState, and access (initializing, reseting, getting data) is gaurded by the exported helper object.

* Add DOM fixture for cross-origin errors

* Use a custom error object in place of cross-origin errors

Cross-origin errors aren't accessible by React in DEV mode because we
catch errors using a global error handler, in order to preserve the
""Pause on exceptions"" behavior of the DevTools. When this happens, we
should use a custom error object that explains what happened.

For uncaught errors, the actual error message is logged to the console
by the browser, so React should skip logging the message again.

* Add test case that demonstrates errors are logged even if they're caught

* Don't double log error messages in DEV

In DEV, the browser always logs errors thrown inside React components,
even if the originating update is wrapped in a try-catch, because of the
dispatchEvent trick used by invokeGuardedCallback. So the error logger
should not log the message again.

* Fix tests

* Change how error is printed in DEV and PROD

In DEV, we don't want to print the stack trace because the browser already always prints it.
We'll just print the component stack now.

In PROD, we used to omit the JS error message. However we *do* want to show it because
if the application swallows the error, the browser will *not* print it. In DEV it works
only because of the fake event trick. So in PROD we will always print the underlying error
by logging the error object directly. This will show both the message and the JS stack.

* Make the wording tighter and emphasize the real error is above

There's a few goals in the rewording:

* Make it tighter using line breaks between sentences.
* Make it slightly less patronizing (""You should fix it"" => ""You can find its details in an earlier log"")
* ^^ This also helps highlight that the real error message and stack is above
* Group subsections: intro (there's an error), component stack, and final addendum about error boundaries
* ^^ Otherwise people might think error boundaries are part of the reason they have an error
* Make it clear ""located at"" is not the stacktrace. Otherwise it feels confusing. This makes it clearer you should still look for stack trace (with other details) above and introduces the concept of component stack.

* Make the message shorter

* Unused variables

* Fix an error caused by fixing lint

* One more bikeshed

* Fix fixture

* Remove unused file

* Concise wording

invokeGuardedCallback is a function we use in place of try-catch
statement. It accepts a function, and if the function throws, it
captures the error. In production, the implementation is a normal try-
catch. In development, we swap out the prod implementation for a special
version designed to preserve ""Pause on all exceptions"" behavior of the
browser DevTools.

invokeGuardedCallbackDev works by dispatching an event to a dummy DOM
node and calling the provided function inside a handler for that event.
We also attach an error event handler to the window object. If the
function throws, the global event handler is called and we can access
the error.

The global event handler is added and removed right before and after the
fake event is dispatched. But if invokeGuardedCallbackDev is nested --
 that is, if it's invoked inside the body of another
invokeGuardedCallbackDev -- multiple error event handlers will attached
simultaneously. We only want the handler that corresponds to the deepest
level to handle the error. So we keep track of a depth counter, and
within the event handler, we only handle the error if the current depth
matches the depth at the time the function was invoked.

The problem that we discovered, and that this PR fixes, is that the
depth counter is local to each renderer. So if you nest separate copies
of invokeGuardedCallback from separate renderers, each renderer will
have its own depth counter, and multiple error handlers will fire for a
single, nested error."

* RFC Add warning for rendering into container that was updated manually

RFC because we still need to tidy this up and verify that all tests
pass.

**what is the change?:**
We want to warn when users render into a container which was manually
emptied or updated outside of React. This can lead to the cryptic error
about not being able to remove a node, or just lead to silent failures
of render. This warning should make things more clear.

Note that this covers the case where the contents of the root container
are manually updated, but does not cover the case where something was
manually updated deeper in the tree.

**why make this change?:**
To maintain parity and increase clarity before releasing v16.0 beta.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

last item under the '16 beta' checklist.

* Add test and tweak check for rendering into manually updated container

STILL TODO: figure out how to skip this warning when the component
renders to a portal.

Unfortunately 'ReactPortal.isPortal(children)' returns false, even in
the failing test where we are rendering to a portal.

**what is the change?:**
- added a test for the case where we call 'ReactDOM.render' with a new
  container, using a key or a different type, after the contents of the
  first container were messed with outside of React. This case throws,
  and now at least there will be an informative warning along with the
  error.
- We updated the check to compare the parent of the 'hostInstance' to
  the container; this seems less fragile
- tweaked some comments

**why make this change?:**
Continue improving this to make it more final.

* Skip warning in 'ReactDOMFiberEntry' when mounting to Comment node

**what is the change?:**
We have a warning for cases when the container doesn't match the parent
which we remembered the previously rendered content being rendered into.

We are skipping that warning when you render into a 'comment' node.

**why make this change?:**
Basically, if you render into a 'comment' node, then the parent of the
comment node is the container for your rendered content. We could check
for similarity there but rendering into a comment node seems like a
corner case and I'd rather skip the warning without knowing more about
what could happen in that case.

**what is the change?:**
Various changes to get this closer to being finished;
- Improved warning message (thanks @spicyj!!!)
- Removed dedup check on warning
- Remove mocking of 'console.error' in portals test

**why make this change?:**
- warning message improvement: communicates better with users
- Remove dedup check: it wasn't important in this case
- Remove mocking of 'console.error'; we don't want to ignore an
  inaccurate warning, even for an ""unstable"" feature.

**test plan:**

**issue:**
issue #8854

* Possible fix for issue of incorrect warning for portal re-render

**what is the change?:**
Add a property to a container which was rendered into using
`ReactDOM.unstable_createPortal`.

**why make this change?:**
We don't want to warn for mismatching container nodes in this case - the
user intentionally rendered into the portal container instead of the
original container.

concerns;
- will this affect React Native badly?
- will this add bloat to the portal code? seems small enough but not
  sure.

* Fix logic for checking if the host instance container is a portal

**what is the change?:**

* Add 'unmountComponentAtNode' call in test for reconciling pre-rendered markup

**what is the change?:**
We have a test that verifies React can reconcile text from pre-rendered
mark-up. It tests React doing this for three strings and three empty
strings.

This adds a call to 'unmountComponentAtNode' between the two
expectations for strings and empty strings.

**why make this change?:**
We now warn when someone messes with the DOM inside of a node in such a
way that removes the React-rendered content. This test was doing that. I
can't think of a situation where this would happen with server-side
rendering without the need to call 'unmountComponentAtNode' before
inserting the server-side rendered content.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

Only one more failing test, will fix that in the next commit.

* remove unused variable

* Fix type error and improve name of portal container flag

**NOTE:** I am still looking for a good place to move this flag
assignment to, or a better approach. This does some intermediate fixes.

**what is the change?:**
- fixed flow error by allowing optional flag on a DOMContainer that
  indicates it was used as a portal container.
- renamed the flag to something which makes more sense

**why make this change?:**
- get Flow passing
- make this change make more sense

We are still not sure about adding this flag; a follow-up diff may move
it or take a different approach.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Add flag to portalContainer on mount instead of in `createPortal`

**what is the change?:**
We add a flag to the container of a 'portal' in the 'commit work' phase
in Fiber. This is right before we call `appendChildToContainer`.

**why make this change?:**
- Sometimes people call `ReactDOM.render(... container)`, then manually
clear the content of the `container`, and then try to call another
`ReactDOM.render(... container)`.
- This leads to cryptic errors or silent failure because we hold a
  reference to the node that was rendered the first time, and expect it
  to still be inside the container.
- We added a warning for this issue in `renderSubtreeIntoContainer`, but
  when a component renders something returned by
  `ReactDOM.unstable_createPortal(<Component />, portalContainer);`,
  then the child is inside the `portalContainer` and not the `container,
  but that is valid and we want to skip warning in that case.

Inside `renderSubtreeIntoContainer` we don't have the info to determine
if a child was rendered into a `portalContainer` or a `container`, and
adding this flag lets us figure that out and skip the warning.

We originally added the flag in the call to
`ReactDOM.unstable_createPortal` but that seemed like a method that
should be ""pure"" and free of side-effects. This commit moves the
flag-adding to happen when we mount the portal component.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**

* Force an 'any' type for the `hostInstance.parentNode` in warning check

**what is the change?:**
This is awful. :(
I'm not sure how else to let Flow know that we expect that this might be
a sort of `DOMContainer` type and not just a normal `Node` type.

To at least make the type information clear we added a comment.

**why make this change?:**
To get `flow` passing. Looks like we have `any` types sprinkled
throughout this file. phooey. :(

**test plan:**
`yarn flow`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Ignore portals in `DOMRenderer.findHostInstance`

**what is the change?:**
We want to ignore portals when firing a certain warning.

This allows us to get the host instance and ignore portals.

Also added a new snapshot recording while fixing things.

**why make this change?:**
Originally we had added a flag to the DOM node which was used for

rendering the portal, and then could notice and ignore children rendered
into those nodes.

However, it's better to just ignore portals in
`DOMRenderer.findHostInstance` because
 - we will not ignore a non-portal second child with this approach
 - we meant to ignore portals in this method anyway (according to a
   'TODO' comment)
 - this change only affects the DOM renderer, instead of changing code
   which is shared with RN and other renderers
 - we avoid adding unneeded expandos

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Ran prettier

* Remove error snapshot test

I think there is a bug where an empty snapshot is treated as an 'outdated snapshot'.

If I delete the obsolute snapshot, and run ReactDOMFiber-test.js it generates a new snapshot.
But then when I run the test with the newly generated snapshot, it says ""1 obsolete snapshot found"",
At some point I will file an issue with Jest. For now going to skip the snapshot generation for the error message in the new test.

* Remove expando that we were adding to portal container

**what is the change?:**
see title

**why make this change?:**
this is part of an old approach to detecting portals, and we have
instead added a check in the `findHostInstance` method to filter out
portals.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Fork `findHostInstance` to make `findHostInstanceWithNoPortals`

**what is the change?:**
We need to get host instances, but filter out portals. There is not
currently a method for that.

**why make this change?:**
Rather than change the existing `findHostInstance` method, which would
affect the behavior of the public `findDOMNode` method, we are forking.

Allows us to run both in the same jest run. The setupMocks file is forked into
specific environment configuration for each project. This replaces the
environment variable.

I used copy pasta here to make it clear. We can abstract this later. It's clear
to me that simply extracting shared stuff is not the best way to abstract this.
setupMocks for example didn't need all the code in both branches.

I think that some of the stuff that is shared such as error message extracting
etc. should probably be lifted out into a stand-alone jest project instead of
being shared.

* Use performFailedUnitOfWork

instead of beginFailedWork and completeUnitOfWork separately. Also, we
unwind the context stack *before* beginning work again.

* Only use error loop directly after a commit

We have a special, forked version of work loop that checks if a fiber is
in a failed state (needs to be unmounted). This is only relevant right
after a commit -- begin phase errors are handled differently, by
unwinding the stack.

Also renamed findNextUnitOfWork to resetNextUnitOfWork and made it a
void function to signal that it's impure.

* Reset nextUnitOfWork after every commit

* Include the error boundary when unwinding a failed subtree

Also added a warning to the error boundary to show that it failed.

* Push context providers in beginFailedWork to avoid push/pop mismatch

Added a test that demonstrates how an error boundary that is also a
context provider could pop its context too many times if you neglect
to push it in beginFailedWork. This happens because we've already
popped the context once in unwindContext.

The solution is a code smell. I don't like how we push/pop context in
so many places. Shouldn't they all happen in the same location?

* Refactor work loop

- Optimizes the normal, non-error path by reducing the number of checks
needed to begin performing work.
- Prevents control flow from oscillating between fast normal loop and
slower error loop.

* Improve context unwinding test

Tests that we correctly unwind an error boundary that is also a
context provider.

* Triangle tester should assert the tree is consistent after every action

...not just at the end.

* Better implementation of infinite loop error

Infinite loops should only be possible if a while loop never terminates.
Now that we've refactored to avoid oscillation between different
work loops, we can count updates local to each loop.

The two loops that could infinite loop are the sync work loop and the
loop that surrounds the body of the render phase catch block. The
async loop could also fall into an infinite loop if the deadline never
terminates, but we'll assume that it always eventually does.

This change also creates better error stack traces because the error is
thrown from inside the first setState that exceeds the limit.

Added a test case for an error boundary whose parent remounts it
on recovery.

* Add a regression test that passes in Stack but fails in Fiber

The failure happens because trackValueOnNode() can exit early if it detects an existing descriptor on node, or if it sees a ""broken"" Safari descriptor (which is how we encountered this bug in the wild).

As a result, the tracker field was not set, and subsequent updateValueIfChanged() call went into the branch that initializes the tracker lazily. That branch has a bug in Fiber mode where it passes the wrong type.

We did not see this issue before because that branch is relatively hard to hit (you have to either run it in Safari or define a custom DOM value descriptor which is what I did in the test).

In the future, we will likely remove the lazy branch altogether since if we bailed out of setting up the tracker once, we will likely bail out every time. But for now I'm just focused on a minimal fix to unbreak master.

* Fix updateValueIfChanged() lazy path to work with DOM argument

* Slightly reorder lines for clarity and record tests

* Extract the top element frame from ReactDebugCurrentFrame

This is part of a larger refactor to decouple stack addendums. All
renderers have their own way of getting the stack of the currently
executing components.

There is one special case in Element Validator that adds an additional line
for the element being validated. This commit moves that special case in
into the validator.

There is another case where it looked like this was used in shallow
renderer but this is actually something different. It is part of the
component stack. It just happens to be that shallow renderer has a simpler
implementation of the component stack that just happens to be a single
element.

This will let us decouple the implementation to get a stack from
ReactDebugCurrentFrame and put that in each renderer.

* Stop using ReactComponentTreeHook for Fiber

Currently we fall back to ReactCurrentOwner in ReactComponentTreeHook for
stack addendums. We shouldn't need to because we should use
ReactDebugCurrrentFiber.

Ensure we always set both ReactDebugCurrentFiber and ReactDebugCurrentFrame
so that we can rely on these for all stacks.

* Make ReactDebugCurrentFrame implementation independent

Introduced ReactDebugCurrentStack for the Stack renderer which does the
same thing as ReactDebugCurrentFiber.

ReactDebugCurrentFrame no longer keeps track of the current fiber/debug id.
That's handled by the individual renderers.

Instead, it is now used to keep track of the current *implementation* of
the current stack frame. That way it is decoupled from the specifics of
the renderers. There can be multiple renderers in a context. What matters
is which one is currently executing a debuggable context (such as a render
function).

* Add debug frames to ReactPartialRenderer (ssr)

Basic functionality.

* Add shared modules to shallow renderer

This is now needed because we share describeComponentFrame."

* Limit the number of nested synchronous updates

In Stack, an infinite update loop would result in a stack overflow. This
gives the same behavior to Fiber.

Conceptually, I think this check belongs in findNextUnitOfWork, since
that is what we call right before starting a new stack. I've put it
in scheduleUpdate for now so I have access to the component that
triggered the nested update. But we could track that explicitly instead.

I've chosen 1000 as the limit rather arbitrarily. Most legit use cases
should really have a much smaller limit, but a smaller limit could break
existing code. For now I'm only concerned with preventing an infinite
loop. We could add a warning that fires at the smaller limit.

* Move check to findNextUnitOfWork

Including the name of the component in the message probably isn't
necessary. The JS stack will include either componentDidUpdate or
componentWillUpdate. And the component that's updating won't
necessarily be the component whose lifecycle triggered it.

So let's move the infinite loop check to findNextUnitWork as I
originally wanted to."

**what is the change?:**
Adding an 'invariant' with detailed error message for the problem that
occurs when you load two copies of React with the Fiber reconciler.

WIP:
 - Is there any other likely cause for this error besides two copies of
   React?
 - How can we make the message more clear?

Still TODO:
 - Write a unit test
 - Write a documentation page and create the link to the page, similar
   to https://facebook.github.io/react/warnings/refs-must-have-owner.html

It would also be nice to have a page with instructions on how to fix
common cases of accidental double-loading of React, but we can open a
separate issue on that and let the community do it.

**why make this change?:**
This error comes up relatively often and we want to make things clear
when it happens in v16.0+

**test plan:**
WIP

**issue:**
Fixes #9962

* Add improved warning and docs for 'refs must have owner' in Fiber

**what is the change?:**
 - Added warning in the place where this error is thrown in Fiber, to
   get parity with older versions of React.
 - Updated docs to mention new error message as well as old one.

I started to write a new docs page for the new error, and realized the
content was the same as the old one. So then I just updated the existing
error page.

**why make this change?:**
We want to avoid confusion when this error is thrown from React v16.

**test plan:**
- manually inspected docs page
- manually tested in a CRA to trigger the error message

This fixes the copy-paste error and we now are actually running the
tests with fiber enabled locally.

* Warn for text content

* Warn for different attributes/properties values

Warns if there are unknown extra attributes in the hydrated node.

It also tries to compare the existing property or attribute against the
expected value. It does this by reading the property and comparing it to
the prop. Except it's not that simple because multiple prop values can
yield the same output. For this we pass an extra expected value that is
a hint as to which one was used. This is a bit weird but I'm not sure the
alternatives were much better.

* Warn when there is an insertion or deletion during hydration

This warns if there is ever an insertion or deletion due to hydration
failing to find a match.

Currently we can't warn for insertions required into the root because
that's how we do all non-hydrating renders atm. Left a todo.

This strategy is a bit unfortunate that it leads to so much plumbing code.
And we have to add three extra methods to the HostConfig that are only used
in DEV and not for anything else. I don't really have a better idea.

* Don't try to delete children of a textarea

Textareas are special cases. The initial mount inserts children
as the default value, but we should leave that untouched. This is the same
as the special case where we set text content of children so I'll use that
mechanism.

* Change expected format for text differences

In Stack this is presented as HTML which needs to have normalized escaping
rules. In Fiber it is currently not presented as HTML but a raw string
so we don't escape it.

* Unmount component in between tests

In Fiber, the second warning isn't issued because it's considered an update
not a new initial render and we don't fire the warning for those.

* Change expectation of white space text behavior in Fiber

In Fiber we don't expect empty strings to be different from rendering null.
In fact, in a follow up I plan on formalizing this by never creating text
Fibers for empty strings.

* Warn for different dangerouslySetInnerHTML

We can't just compare the raw innerHTML value because it will have been
normalized. Instead, we'll create another element, set its innerHTML and
read it back.

Since there can be custom elements registered with this document, we want
to avoid any side-effects they might cause. So I do this in a fresh new
document.

I'm not sure how this would affect controlled components and other stuff
that could have changed after runtime. I think for those cases maybe we
just need a general way of opting out of the diff."

Simplifies markup generation by only inserting a simple comments between

efficient but will also be needed by hydration validator.

When a user types an emoji via Touch keyboard in IE, React's fallback logic
creates the `BeforeInput` event based on the `keypress`.  However, the length
of an emoji character (e.g. `\uD83D\uDE0A`) is two, so the `which` property
does not represent an emoji correctly.

Because IE's KeyboardEvent has the `char` property holding an entire emoji,
we can use it directly instead of converting from the `which`."

The tests only assert that the output of the tree is consistent after

the expected value. It does not assert how work is reused, which means
it can't detect starvation issues. However, this also means that it
is fairly resilient to changes in our incremental algorithm."

* Add check for string and null 'rootElement' in ReactDOMFiber

**what is the change?:**
Before we call 'rootElement.getAttribute' we check that the method is
defined.

**why make this change?:**
There is an internal use case I found where 'rootElement' is a string
and null at different points as the page is rendered.

It looks like this method was added as part of support for re-hydration
of server-side rendered content. I can't imagine we would want to reuse
content if the rootnode is a string or null. Not sure if we want an
earlier check that it's an element before this point.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`
and I manually tested this fix in the internal case where it was
breaking

* Add test and improve check for non-element rootElement

**what is the change?:**
We use the nodeType to check that we have the correct type of
rootElement, and we added a unit test.

**why make this change?:**
Improve this solution to the problem.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

* Don't hydrate any properties other than event listeners and text content

This strategy assumes that the rendered HTML is correct if the tree lines
up. Therefore we don't diff any attributes of the rendered HTML.

However, as a precaution I ensure that textContent *is* updated. This
ensures that if something goes wrong with keys lining up etc. at least
there is some feedback that the event handlers might not line up. With
what you expect. This might not be what you want e.g. for date formatting
where it can different between server and client.

It is expected that content will line up. To ensure that I will in a follow
up ensure that the warning is issued if it doesn't line up so that in
development this can be addressed.

The text content updates are now moved to the commit phase so if the tree
is asynchronously hydrated it doesn't start partially swapping out. I use
the regular update side-effect with payload if the content doesn't match up.

Since we no longer guarantee that attributes is correct I changed the
bad mark up SSR integration tests to only assert on the textContent
instead.

* Hydrate text node if possible

Currently we're never matching text nodes so we need to properly branch."

This is a follow-up on
https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9584#discussion_r115642293. There
is no need to assign the value property of an input if the value
property of the React component changes types, but stringifies to the
same value. For example:

```javascript
DOM.render(<input value=""true"" />, el)
DOM.render(<input value={true} />, el)
```

In this case, the assignment to `input.value` will always be
cast to the string ""true"". There is no need to perform this
assignment. Particularly when we already cast the value to a string
later:

```javascript
// Cast `value` to a string to ensure the value is set correctly. While
// browsers typically do this as necessary, jsdom doesn't.
node.value = '' + value;

This is not super easy to test unless we are doing a sync with FB afaik. I plan on running a sync in the next few days, or next week at latest, for the sake of not landing big things on a Friday. That will be the actual test of this.

* Add 'Test Utils' docs back to main navigation

**why make this change?:**
We accidentally removed this - still supporting the use of Test Utilities, so we should have them in the docs.

**test plan:**
Manually tested the website - will insert a screenshot.

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9651

* Move test-utils docs to reference section

**what is the change?:**
Moved from 'advanced guides' to 'reference'

**why make this change?:**
It makes more sense as a reference

**test plan:**
Visual inspection (flarnie may add a screenshot)

**issue:**

* Add back the shallow renderer docs and remove outdated docs

**what is the change?:**
- Remove outdated 'shallow renderer' docs on 'test utils' page, and point to the updated 'shallow renderer' docs.
- Re-add a link to the updated 'shallow renderer' docs on the main navigation.

**why make this change?:**
This was already approved in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9331 which was then cherry-picked to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9359/commits and landed on master.

I'm not sure why some of these changes didn't persist. For now just adding back the changes we need.

**test plan:**
Manually inspected website - will insert screenshots.

**issue:**

* Further improvements to 'shallow rendering' and 'test utils' docs

Thanks @gaearon for the improvements!

**what is the change?:**
- Remove <hr/> from end of 'shallow rendering' docs
- 'documents' -> 'documentation'
- Move 'shallow rendering' redirection section to top of 'test utils' docs
- Add intro sentence about testing to 'shallow rendering' docs

**why make this change?:**
Documentation helps people learn.

* Update 2015-12-16-ismounted-antipattern.md

In case anybody else stumbles across this old blog post, I wanted to submit a patch to help with unhandled rejections.  

`#then` and `#catch` each return new Promise instances, so here we actually create two new promises (that aren't assigned).  If the argument promise to `#makeCancelable` rejects, the promise created by `#then` will be an unhandled rejection, which in Node 7 will be an uncaught error.  

By using the second argument of `#then` to handle rejections instead, we don't need to worry about the runtime finding any unhandled rejections here.

* Don't double validate the DOM container

The warnings need to check a valid container but that should happen in
unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer too so might as well move it in.

* Hydrating DOM

Hydrates a server-rendered DOM tree by traversing it and connecting up the nodes if they match. Attributes are not diffed. They're assumed to be accurate on matching nodes.

* Remove meta data filtering from test

Because the current server renderer includes the meta data, it remains in a revived tree.

* Annotate because Flow

* Don't track insertion effects if we're going to hydrate

During initial mount, we should not track Placement

* Fix up test cases to ignore errors that we no longer throw

TODO make these warnings instead.

* Correctly track hydration state inside a newly inserted tree

When we don't match the first hydration node, we'll do an insertion.
Currently we keep the next hydratable sibling so that we know where to
pick up once we're done with the insertion. Unfortunately this makes the
nodes inside the insertion think that there's a node to hydrate.

I used to check for the direct parent but that doesn't work on nested host components.

We need to instead keep track of that we're in an hydration context but
we're not currently hydrating. Once we pop passed the inserted node can
we resume hydrating.

* Hacky fix to isMounted

isMounted checks whether a component is inside a Placement. During
hydration we ideally don't do any Placements if hydration matches the tree.

To work around this I use the Placement flag on the root, which isn't used
for anything else. But only temporarily while we're hydrating. Then reset
it before committing.

Since stripEnvVariables was used to replace __DEV__ references, I assumed it (and other plugins) we run before requires statements were processed. Obviously I was wrong 😬 and as a result, the RN Stack and Fiber builds were way too large. This is an attempt to mimic the approach taken with DOM renderer and stub out modules that we explicitly don't want to include.

The alternative to this would have been to fork findNodeHandle, NativeMethodsMixin, ReactNativeBaseComponent, etc. and essentially avoid using the feature flag. That didn't seem tenable. The previous injection approach also doesn't work here because the circular references it resulted in caused Rollup to choke when creating the modules."

* Split ReactNativeFiber into separate ReactNativeFiberRenderer module
Hopefully this is sufficient to work around Rollup circular dependency problems. (To be seen in subsequent commits...)

* Split findNodeHandle into findNodeHandleFiber + findNodeHandleStack
This allowed me to remove the ReactNative -> findNodeHandle injections, which should in turn allow me to require a fully-functional findNodeHandle without going through ReactNative. This will hopefully allow ReactNativeBaseomponent to avoid a circular dependency.

* Un-forked findNodeHandle in favor of just inlining the findNode function impl

* takeSnapshot no longer requires/depends-on ReactNative for findNodeHandle
Instead it uses the new, renderer-specific wrappers (eg findNodeHandleFiberWrapper and findNodeHandleStackWrapper) to ensure the returned value is numeric (or null). This avoids a circular dependency that would trip up Rollup.

* NativeMethodsMixin requires findNodeHandler wrapper(s) directly rather than ReactNative
This works around a potential circular dependency that would break the Rollup build

* Add RN_* build targets to hash-finle-name check

* Strip @providesModule annotations from headers for RN_* builds

* Added process.env.REACT_NATIVE_USE_FIBER to ReactNativeFeatureFlags
This is kind of a hacky solution, but it is temporary. It works around the fact that ReactNativeFeatureFlag values need to be set at build time in order to avoid a mismatch between runtime flag values. DOM avoids the need to do this by using injection but Native is not able to use this same approach due to circular dependency issues.

* Moved a couple of SECRET exports to dev-only. Removed SyntheticEvent and PooledClass from SECRET exports. Converted Rollup helper function to use named params.

* Split NativeMethodsMixins interface and object-type

* Add @noflow header to flat-bundle template to avoid triggering Flow problems
When Flow tries to infer such a large file, it consumes massive amounts of CPU/RAM and can often lead to programs crashing. It is better for such large files to use .flow.js types instead.

* NativeMethodsMixin and ReactNativeFiberHostComponent now share the same Flow type

* Collocated (externally exposed) ReactTypes and ReactNativeTypes into single files to be synced to fbsource. ReactNativeFiber and ReactNativeStack use ReactNativeType Flow type

* Build script syncs RN types and PooledClass automatically

* Initial regeneration of results.json

**what is the change?:**
We ran `yarn build` and updated the perf. stats record.

**why make this change?:**
Some commits have landed without updating this. By getting an initial update, I can run the build script again after my changes and see any size regressions.

* Downgrade deprecation warnings from errors to warnings

**what is the change?:**
Swapping out `warning` module for a fork that uses `console.warn`.
It looks like we were using the `warning` module for deprecation notices, *but* there is also a 'deprecated' module designed specifically for deprecation notices.

However, we could not find any place that it was currently used.

Since React's build process is not 100% clear to me, I assume it could still be used somewhere by something and just updated it along with other deprecation notices.

We might consider a follow-up diff that does some clean up here;
 - remove 'deprecated' module if it's unused, OR
 - use 'deprecated' module for all our current deprecation warnings

**why make this change?:**
- We have had complaints about noisy warnings, in particular after introducing new deprecations
- They potentially cause CI failures
- Deprecations are not really time-sensitive, can ship without breaking your app, etc.

For more context - https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9395

**test plan:**
`npm run test`
and unit tests for the new modules
and manual testing (WIP)

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9395

* Add 'lowPriorityWarning' to ReactExternals

**what is the change?:**
We won't bundle 'lowPriorityWarning' with the rest of React when building for Facebook.
NOTE: A parallel commit will introduce an internal implementation of 'lowPriorityWarning' in Facebook's codebase, to compensate. Will post a comment with the diff number once that is up.

**why make this change?:**
So that the sync between github and Facebook can go more smoothly!

**test plan:**
We will see when I run the sync! But this is a reasonable first step imo.

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9398

* Make state mutations an error, not low-pri warning

**what is the change?:**
Even though this is a ""deprecation"" warning, we still want to use 'console.error' for it.

**why make this change?:**
- It's not likely to come up now, hopefully, because this warning has been present for some time
- This will cause real issues in production if ignored

**test plan:**
`yarn test` - we did fix one test which failed bc of this change

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9398

* Fix test of assigning to this.state that was only passing in fiber

**what is the change?:**
updated a unit test for assigning directly to state; it once again raises an error and not a warning.

**why make this change?:**
So that tests pass

**test plan:**

* Revert ReactDOMServer.js and the fiber tests per Sebastian

This also reverts the changes I made to ReactDOMComponent-test.js which removed the stack which is missing in the new server renderer""

* Rename files based on feedback

Moving src/renderers/dom/server/ReactDOMServerRendering.js to src/renderers/server/ReactServerRenderer.js and add src/renderers/server/ReactServer.js which makes this new codepath completely separate.

* Change throw to invariant, even though we probably need to remove this at some point

**what is the change?:**
See title.

**why make this change?:**
Both these dependencies were causing issues when working on React internally at
FB.

'lighthouse' requires node >=6 and we don't want to folks working on React to
using that version of node.
https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/package.json#L11

'nodegit' for me throws an error related to libssh2 and it's annoying to make
this work in every OS. See https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/issues/1266

**test plan:**
`npm/yarn install`
Runs with no errors on my CentOS machine and also on MacOSX laptop.

**issue:**
This is blocking work related to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9398"

**what is the change?:**
A test was added for a change to Fiber's behavior in #9608, and because of a
bug in our CirclCI script it landed when failing for non-fiber runs of the
tests.

This just wraps the test in a feature flag because it seems clear it was
only intended to test the new fiber behavior.

Thanks to @gaearon for pairing on this! :)

**why make this change?:**
So that tests are passing on master.

numeric text entry.

Adding a section to the change log where we start accumulating

* Update Changelog for v15.5.1-15.5.4

This could really use extra code review attention since the history of
these changes was a bit convoluted to follow.

After talking to @bvaughn and @acdlite, we thought it might make sense
to put the 'add-ons' changes in a separate change log. The other option,
of including them in the main React change log, seemed the more
confusing of the two.

Also this commit is related to and somewhat blocked by
https://github.com/reactjs/prop-types/pull/40

**what is the change?:**
Adding the change log for recent patch versions of React.

**why make this change?:**
We missed this step in the flurry of releasing patches, and it's useful
for folks who want info about what version to use.

**test plan:**
Visual inspection of the change log.

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9443

* Further improve CHANGELOG entries for v15.5.1-15.5.4

**what is the change?:**
- Use the '[@author] in [#PR/commit]' format for annotations
- Make annotations less technical, more clear
- Move 'React Addons' updates into main changelog
- Remove separate 'React Addons' changelog

**why make this change?:**
These changes each make things more clear and accurate.

**test plan:**
Visual inspection

**issue:**

* Fix final nits in CHANGELOG

**what is the change?:**
- Put backticks around package names
- Reformat link to to commit in '([@user](...) in [#NNNN](...))' format
- Remove newlines after subheaders; in the past we sometimes have
  included a newline after the subheader, but most recently it looks
  like we do not.
- Add some missing punctuation.

**why make this change?:**
Consistency and aesthetics

**test plan:**
Visual inspection

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9443

* Add deprecation notice to v15.5.0-15.5.3

**what is the change?:**
Adding deprecation notice to some recent React versions.

**why make this change?:**
These versions of React use a version of `prop-types` that had a
critical bug. We updated the dependency in React 15.5.4, and hopefully
people will see this notice and update.

**test plan:**
Visual inspection

**issue:**

Adds a server-rendering fixture based on create-react-app without ejecting.

This is using the full-page strategy because I wanted to flush out any issues with it. Turns out there's a lot of little things that are fixable and some non-fixable. This actually surfaced some differences between the current strategy and the one I had in mind.

This uses the asset manifest from webpack to pass the final URLs to the client. This ensures that we can render the same exact mark up on the client - including the URL to our own script that we're running in.

Doing full document renders work with 15.x as long as the checksum matches. However, with the patch up reviving strategy I had in mind it would end up removing the CSS tags that webpack injects before running our render call. This is a behavior change.

In dev mode the server runs a proxy in front of the normal CRA webpack server so that we can replace the HTML request for the root page.

I don't know what the best way to link in the react and react-dom packages. Each fixture has a different strategy so here's another one. Just add NODE_PATH=../../build/packages in front of all commands."

Shallow renderer and test utils bundles

Adds new bundles introduced with React 15.5 release to master (and 16 alpha)

react-dom/test-utils:

This new bundle contains what used to be react-addons-test-utils. This bundle shares things from react-dom rather than duplicates them.

A temporary createRenderer method has been left behind as a way to access the new shallow renderer. This is for the ReactNative release cycle only and should be going away before the final release.

react-test-renderer/shallow:

This new shallow renderer is almost entirely stand-alone (in that it doesn't use the React reconciler or scheduler). The only touch points are ReactElement and prop/context validation. This renderer is stack and fiber compatible."

* Fix tests to pass when we warn for missing keys in fragments

In most cases we just needed to add the 'key' prop.

This ignores the tests which are already failing on master when running
with ` REACT_DOM_JEST_USE_FIBER=1` - there are 8.

All tests should now pass with `npm run test`, and the 8 which fail when
running `REACT_DOM_JEST_USE_FIBER=1 npm run test` are the same 8 which
are failing on master.

* Added missing key warning for children in array fragments

After trying twice to reuse the code between the ReactChildFiber and
ReactElementValidator, I am thinking that it's simpler to just have some
duplication of code. The parts that are shared are interleaved with
parts which cannot be shared, either because of singleton modules that
must be required differently in 'isomorphic' and the 'renderers', or the
fact that 'warning' requires a hard coded string.

Test Plan:

- Added test to ReactChildren-test
- Manually tested via fixture that was not committed.

* commit updated ""scripts/rollup/results.json""

* Make 'ReactChildren-test' more specific, and remove unneeded nesting

Based on helpful tips from @spicyj and @aweary's review
 - Made the unit test for the warning on missing keys more specific
 - Removed unneeded nesting in the code which generates missing key
   warning
 - Change test syntax to use JSX to be more consistent

Also fixes flow warning.

* Commit update of scripts/rollup/results.json

* `react-addons-test-utils` -> `react-dom/test-utils`

Updating all references and docs on the `React.addons.TestUtils` and the
shallow renderer to refer to the correct targets.

Instead of:
```
const React = require('react');

// ...
React.addons.Testutils
// or

const ReactTestUtils = require('react-addons-test-utils');
```
we now show:
```
const ReactTestUtils = require('react-dom/test-utils');
```

And for shallow renderer, instead of:
```
const shallowRenderer = TestUtils.createRenderer();
```

we now show:
```
const shallowRenderer = require('react-test-renderer/shallow');
```

* Update the 'prev' and 'next' attributes of 'add-ons' docs

These flags are used to set arrow links to easily navigate through the
documents. They were wrong or missing in some of the 'add-ons' pages and
this bothered me when manually testing the updates from the previous
commit.

* Update syntax for instantiating shallow renderer

Missed this when updating the docs for the changes to shallow-renderer
in React 15.5.

* Fix pointers in addons docs

Thanks @bvaughn for catching this

* Make example of shallow renderer more consistent

We should show using the same variable names between code samples.

* Make names in example even more consistent

We should use the same variable name for the same thing across examples.
`renderer` -> `shallowRenderer`.

* Update docs to deprecate React<CSS>TransitionGroup

 - removes link to the docs about `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` and
   `ReactTransitionGroup` from the main navigation
 - updates 'prev' and 'next' pointers to skip this page
 - adds deprecation warning to the top of the page
 - remove references to these modules from the packages README
 - updates 'add-ons' main page to list this as a deprecated add-on

* Update `React.createClass` to `createReactClass` in the docs

The `React.createClass` method is being deprecated in favor of
`createReactClass`.

* Remove 'React.createClass' from top level API docs

It no longer makes sense to have a section for the 'createClass' method
in this page, since it won't be available as a top level method on
'React'.

I initially was going to pull the section about 'createClass' into a
separate page to add under 'addons' but it was short and duplicative of
the 'react-without-es6' docs. So I just linked to those.

* Remove *most* `React.PropTypes` from the docs

I am doing the docs for `context` in a separate commit because that case
was a bit less clear-cut.

We will no longer support `React.PropTypes` as a built-in feature of
React, and instead should direct folks to use the `PropTypes` project
that stands alone.

Rather than retaining the `React.PropTypes` examples and just revamping
them to show the use of the stand-alone `PropTypes` library with React,
it makes more sense to direct people to that project and reduce the
perceived API area and complexity of React core. The proper place to
document `PropTypes` is in the README or docs of that project, not in
React docs.

* Update `context` docs to not use `React.PropTypes`

We use `React.PropTypes` to define the `contextType` for the `context`
feature of React. It's unclear how this will work once `React.PropTypes`
is replaced by the external `PropTypes` library. Some options;

a) Deprecate `context`, either in v16 or shortly after. Seems reasonable
based on the intense warnings against using context that we have in the
docs -
https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html#why-not-to-use-context
**Except** that probably some widely used libraries depend on it, like
`React-Router`.

b) Expect users will use external `PropTypes` library when defining
`contextTypes` and just don't do our `checkReactTypeSpec` against them
any more in v16.

c) Stop masking context and pass the whole context
unmasked everywhere. Worst option, do not recommend.

I went with `b` and assume that, for now, we will get users to use the
external `PropTypes` when defining context. I will update this PR if we
want a different approach.

* Remove 'addons' items from left nav, and deprecate 'addons' doc page

The plan:
[X] Remove links to 'addons' items from main navigation
[X] Add deprecation notices where appropriate, and update syntax to show
using the separate modules.
[ ] Update other references to 'React.addons' in docs. Coming in next
commit.
--- blocked but coming in future PRs
[ ] Link to a blog post describing the new locations of add-ons in the
deprecation notice on the '/docs/addons.html' page. Blocked until we
actually publish that blog post.
[ ] Move the docs for each add-on to the actual github repo where it now
lives.
[ ] Redirect the old add-ons doc permalinks to the docs in the separate

I can’t explain the exact grammatical principle this violates, but it sounds wrong to my native English ears that “feature” is plural here. Another way to check if the grammar sounds right is to change the order of the clauses: ”They should be used in moderation, like any powerful feature“ sounds right, whereas “They should be used in moderation, like any powerful features” does not."

During the course of the number input fix, we uncovered many edge
cases. This commit adds browser test fixtures for each of those instances.

* Address edge case preventing number precision lower than 1 place

0.0 coerces to 0, however they are not the same value when doing
string comparision. This prevented controlled number inputs from
inputing the characters `0.00`.

Also adds test cases.

* Accommodate lack of IE9 number input support

IE9 does not support number inputs. Number inputs in IE9 fallback to
traditional text inputs. This means that accessing `input.value` will
report the raw text, rather than parsing a numeric value.

This commit makes the ReactDOMInput wrapper check to see if the `type`
prop has been configured to `""number""`. In those cases, it will
perform a comparison based upon `parseFloat` instead of the raw input
value.

* Remove footnotes about IE exponent issues

With the recent IE9 fix, IE properly inserts `e` when it produces an
invalid number.

* Address exception in IE9/10 ChangeEventPlugin blur event

On blur, inputs have their values assigned. This is so that number
inputs do not conduct unexpected behavior in
Chrome/Safari. Unfortunately, there are cases where the target
instance might be undefined in IE9/10, raising an exception.

* Migrate over ReactDOMInput.js number input fixes to Fiber

Also re-record tests

* Update number fixtures to use latest components

* Add number input test case for dashes and negative numbers

* Replace trailing dash test case with replace with dash

* Removed optimization for events without target in ReactNativeEventEmitter

This PR fixes the problem originally introduced in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6590
The problem is that `ResponderEventPlugin` (and `ResponderTouchHistoryStore`) relies on that fact that touch events are balanced.
So if one `startish` event happened, should be coming `endish` event. Otherwise there is no way to maintain internal `trackedTouchCount` counter. So, if we drop some events, we break this logic.

Moreover, that optimization clearly contradict with this statement from `ResponderEventPlugin`:
```
We must be resilient to `targetInst` being `null` on `touchMove` or
`touchEnd`. On certain platforms, this means that a native scroll has
assumed control and the original touch targets are destroyed.
```

This issue causes several major problems in React Native, and one of them (finally!) is easy to reproduce: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/12976 .

The test also illustrates this problem.

* Update Lifting State Up not to mix up DOM value with component state

A few weeks ago when teaching my friend, she got stuck on
`this.state.value` vs. `event.target.value`. As the documentation
talked a lot about ""values"", and the term value could mean three
different things (values in general, the ""value"" prop / DOM value of
the <input> component and the value in state/props), it was not weird
that she got a bit confused.

* Rename Lifting State Up onChange props to onTemperatureChange

This is in-line with how the temperature is provided as a prop named `temperature`

* Fix one value prop not being renamed to temperature

* Update codepen examples in Lifting state up documentation

This is currently used by both isomorphic and the renderer. I think that
we can probably split these up. The isomorphic type should actually be
different. It has to do with that the caller needs to know exactly which
type of element it is but this is never needed in the renderer which only
needs to know that the type is internally consistent.

The owner type is renderer dependent so it can literally be anything."

Coroutines was kind of broken because it tried to do reparenting and
enabling state preservation to be passed along the coroutine. However,
since we couldn't determine which Fiber was ""current"" on a reified yield
this was kind of broken.

This removes the ""continuation"" part of yields so they're basically just
return values. It is still possible to do continuations by just passing
simple functions or classes as part of the return value but they're not
stateful.

This means that we won't have reparenting, but I actually don't think we
need it. There's another way to structure this by doing all the state in
the first phase and then yielding a stateless representation of the result.
This stateless representation of the tree can then be rendered in different
(or even multiple) locations.

Because we no longer have a stateful continuation, you may have noticed
that this really no longer represent the ""coroutine"" concept. I will
rename it in a follow up commit."

I introduce the ReactDOMFrameScheduling module which just exposes
rIC and rAF.

The polyfill works by scheduling a requestAnimationFrame, store the time
for the start of the frame, then schedule a postMessage which gets
scheduled after paint. The deadline is set to time + frame rate.
By separating the idle call into a separate event tick we ensure that
layout, paint and other browser work is counted against the available time.

The frame rate is dynamically adjusted by tracking the minimum time between
two rAF callbacks. This is not perfect because browsers can schedule
multiple callbacks to catch up after a long frame. To compensate for this
we only adjust if two consecutive periods are faster than normal.

This seems to guarantee that we will hit frame deadlines and we don't end
up dropping frames. However, there is still some lost time so we risk
starving by not having enough idle time.

Especially Firefox seems to have issues keeping up on the triangle demo
However, that is also true for native rIC in Firefox. It seems like more
render work is scheduled on the main thread pipeline and also that JS
execution just generally has more overhead."

* Allow renderers to return an update payload in prepareUpdate

This then gets stored on updateQueue so that the renderer doesn't need to
think about how to store this.

It then gets passed into commitUpdate during the commit phase.

This allows renderers to do the diffing during the time sliced path,
allocate a queue for changes and do only the absolute minimal work to
apply those changes in the commit phase.

If refs update we still schedule and update.

* Hack around the listener problem

* Diff ReactDOMFiber properties in prepareUpdate

We now take advantage of the new capability to diff properties early.
We do this by generating an update payload in the form of an array with
each property name and value that we're about to update.

* Add todo for handling wasCustomComponentTag

* Always force an update to wrapper components

Wrapper components have custom logic that gets applied at the commit phase
so we always need to ensure that we schedule an update for them.

* Incorporate 8652 into new algorithm

* Add failing test for flipping event handlers

This illustrates the problem that happens if we store a pointer to the
Fiber and then choose not to update that pointer when no properties change.
That causes an old Fiber to be retained on the DOM node. Then that Fiber
can be reused by the pooling mechanism which then will mutate that Fiber
with new event handlers, which makes them active before commit.

* Store current props in the RN instance cache and on the DOM node

This represents the current set of event listeners. By not relying on the
Fiber, it allows us to avoid doing any effects in the commit phase when
nothing changes.

This is a bit ugly. Not super happy how this all came together."

By moving memoization to the begin phase, we can do a shallow bailout,
reusing a unit of work even if there's still work to do in its children.

Memoization now happens whenever a fiber's `child` property is updated;
typically, right after reconciling. It's also updated when
`shouldComponentUpdate` returns false, because that indicates that the
given state and props are equal to the memoized state and props."

- Clarify and explain that during render, if the ref callback is provided, it will get called twice, first with `null` and then with the rendered DOM element. Discussed in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4533 and first proposed docs change in PR #8333.

I've also planned on adding an example for passing the refs up the component chain based on something I've needed to solve myself (e.g. you want to connect two dynamic components by line in React, so you need to both use refs and propagate them up the chain), and while it would be great to read up on this in the docs, it may be too specific for this section; I'd be happy to hear any recommendations.

* Adds more specific information about the callback

* Moved the ref callback description to the Caveats section

* Fixed suggested nits

* Replace 'each render pass' with 'updates'

* Tweak the wording"

* Verify that functional component ref warning is deduplicated

It's not a big problem for string refs because the ref stays the same and the warning code path runs once per mount.

However, it is super annoying for functional refs since they're often written as arrows, and thus the warning fires for every render.

Both tests are currently failing since we're mounting twice, so even the string ref case prints warnings twice.

* Extract the warning condition to the top level

We don't want to run getStackAddendumByID() unless we actually know we're going to print the warning.

This doesn't affect correctness. Just a performance fix.

* Deduplicate warnings about refs on functional components

This fixes the duplicate warnings and adds an additional test for corner cases.

Our goal is to print one warning per one offending call site, when possible.

We try to use the element source for deduplication first because it gives us the exact JSX call site location.

If the element source is not available, we try to use the owner name for deduplication.

If even owner name is unavailable, we try to use the functional component unique identifier for deduplication so that at least the warning is seen once per mounted component."

* Fiber stateless comp ref warning should only do work when necessary

* ReactDebugCurrentFiber maybe FunctionalComponents should act this way instead

* (chore) scripts/fiber/record-tests

* Add component._compositeType to ReactInstance Flow definition

* Don't handle 'stack inside fiber' case in the warning

We don't have a test for it. It's easy to mess it up and print the wrong thing so instead of verifying it I'll just remove this bit.

* Revert the change to getCurrentFiberOwnerName

This happened to work, but it is just a coincidence. This change didn’t really match what the function was supposed to be doing.

I’m not sure what the correct fix would be yet so this commit breaks tests.

* Add component indirection to the tests using owner name

This passes in Stack. It helps ensure we supply the correct owner name.

* Invalid type invariant should read owner from element

This brings the Fiber behavior in line with how Stack does it. The Fiber test was passing accidentally but broke down in more complicated cases (such as when we have an <Indirection> between the owner and the failing element).

Now we can also remove the weird cases from getCurrentFiberOwnerName() that didn't really make sense but helped get the (incomplete) tests pass in the past.

* Fiber should throw on a string ref inside functional component"

This moves the current fixture architecture to one based around create-react-app. There are a few important things to note:

* The react-loader.js script is always loaded before the bundle and will populate React and ReactDOM on the window. It is then read from the window by all components.
* The UI for the ""React Sandbox"" or ""React Fixtures App"" is also rendered with whatever version of React the user has selected. This means we dont have to deal with iframes or worry about multiple versions of React potentially interferring. But it also means that all components must be written using createClass to be fully backwards compatable. I tested back to 0.13.1 and it works fine."

* Add manual build fixtures

* Inject ReactDOM into ReactWithAddons from ReactWithAddons

We used to read ReactDOM as a global inside ReactAddonsDOMDependenciesUMDShim.
This didn't work in AMD environments such as RequireJS and SystemJS.

Instead, I changed it so that ReactDOM gets injected into ReactWithAddons by ReactDOM itself.
This way we don't have to try to require it (which wouldn't work because AMD doesn't handle circular dependencies well).

This means you have to load ReactDOM first before using ReactDOM-dependent addons, but this was already the case before.

This commit makes all build fixtures pass.

* Memoize ReactDOM to avoid going into require on every access

* Add Brunch fixture

* Inline requires to work around Brunch bug

See #8556 and https://github.com/brunch/brunch/issues/1591#issuecomment-270742503 for context.
This appears to be a Brunch bug but we can keep a temporary fix until the next major."

However, to support the use of syncUpdates as an opt-in to forced-

recursively.

At the beginning of performWork, the state of the scheduler is saved;
before exiting, that state is restored, so that the scheduler can
continue where it left off. I've decided to use local variables to stash
the previous state. We could also store them in a record and push it to

* Push class context providers early

Previously we used to push them only after the instance was available. This caused issues in cases an error is thrown during componentWillMount().

In that case we never got to pushing the provider in the begin phase, but in complete phase the provider check returned true since the instance existed by that point. As a result we got mismatching context pops.

We solve the issue by making the context check independent of whether the instance actually exists. Instead we're checking the type itself.

This lets us push class context early. However there's another problem: we might not know the context value. If the instance is not yet created, we can't call getChildContext on it.

To fix this, we are introducing a way to replace current value on the stack, and a way to read the previous value. This also helps remove some branching and split the memoized from invalidated code paths.

* Add a now-passing test from #8604

Also rename another test to have a shorter name.

* Move isContextProvider() checks into push() and pop()

All uses of push() and pop() are guarded by it anyway.

This makes it more similar to how we use host context.

There is only one other place where isContextProvider() is used and that's legacy code needed for renderSubtree().

* Clarify why we read the previous context

* Use invariant instead of throwing an error

* Fix off-by-one in ReactFiberStack

* Manually keep track of the last parent context

The previous algorithm was flawed and worked by accident, as shown by the failing tests after an off-by-one was fixed.

The implementation of getPrevious() was incorrect because the context stack currently has no notion of a previous value per cursor.

Instead, we are caching the previous value directly in the ReactFiberContext in a local variable.

Additionally, we are using push() and pop() instead of adding a new replace() method."

* Implement component stack for some warnings in Fiber

* Keep Fiber debug source up to date

When an element changes, we should copy the source and owner again.
Otherwise they can get stale since we're not reading them from the element.

* Remove outdated TODOs from tests

* Explicitly specify Fiber types to include in the stack

Fixes an accidental omission when both source and owner are null but displayName exists.

* Fix mised Stack+Fiber test to not expect extra warnings

When we're in Fiber mode we don't actually expect that warning being printed.

* Warn on passing different props to super()

* Implement duplicate key warnings

We keep known keys in a set in development. There is an annoying special case where we know we'll check it again because we break out of the loop early.

One test in the tree hook regresses to the failing state because it checks that the tree hook works without a Set available, but we started using Set in this code. It is not essential and we can clean this up later when we decide how to deal with polyfills.

* Move ReactTypeOfWork to src/shared

It needs to be available both to Fiber and Isomorphic because the tree hook lives in Isomorphic but pretty-prints Fiber stack.

* Add dev-only ReactDebugCurrentFiber for warnings

The goal is to use ReactCurrentOwner less and rely on ReactDebugCurrentFiber for warning owner name and stack.

* Make Stack invariant messages more consistent

Fiber used a helper so two tests had the same phrasing.
Stack also used a helper for most invariants but hardcoded a different phrase in one place.
I changed that invariant message to use a helper which made it consistent with what it prints in Fiber.

* Make CSSPropertyOperations use getCurrentFiberOwnerName()

This gets mount-time CSS warnings to be printed.

However update-time warnings are currently ignored because current fiber is not yet available during the commit phase.

We also regress on HostOperation hook tests but this doesn't matter because it's only used by ReactPerf and it doesn't work with Fiber yet anyway. We'll have to think more about it later.

* Set ReactDebugCurrentFiber during the commit phase

This makes it available during updates, fixing the last failing test in CSSPropertyOperations.

* Add DOM warnings by calling hooks directly

It is not clear if the old hook system is worth it in its generic incarnation. For now I am just hooking it up to the DOMFiber renderer directly.

* Add client-side counterparts for some warning tests

This helps us track which warnings are really failing in Fiber, and which ones depend on SSR."

This matches what we do in Fiber -- and doing it this way is the only way we can prepare new views in the background before unmounting old ones.

In particular, this breaks this pattern:

```js
class Child1 extends React.Component {
  render() { ... }
  componentWillMount() {
    this.props.registerChild(this);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.props.unregisterChild();
  }
}

class Child2 extends React.Component {
  render() { ... }
  componentWillMount() {
    this.props.registerChild(this);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.props.unregisterChild();
  }
}

class Parent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      showChild1 ?
        <Child1
          registerChild={(child) => this.registered = child}
          unregisterChild={() => this.registered = null}
        /> :
        <Child2
          registerChild={(child) => this.registered = child}
          unregisterChild={() => this.registered = null}
        />
    );
  }
}
```

Previously, `this.registered` would always be set -- now, after a rerender, `this.registered` gets stuck at null because the old child's componentWillUnmount runs *after* the new child's componentWillMount.

A correct fix here is to use componentDidMount rather than componentWillMount. (In general, componentWillMount should not have side effects.) If Parent stored a list or set of registered children instead, there would also be no issue."

* Enable additional (failing) portal tests

* Fix portal unmounting

When unmount a portal, we need to unmount *its* children from itself.
This is similar to what we would do for a root if we allowed deleting roots.

* Skip portals when looking for host siblings

A portal is not part of that host tree despite being a child.

* Fix comment typo

* Add a failing test for portal child reconciliation

It is failing because portal bails out of update, seeing null in pendingProps.
It is null because we set pendingProps to nextPortal.children, which is null in this test.

* Fix the bug when switching to a null portal child

If pendingProps is null, we do a bailout in beginWork.
This prevents unmounting of the existing child when the new child is null.

We fix this by changing portal fiber's pendingProps to be the portal object itself instead of its children.
This way, it is never null, and thus doesn't cause a false positive in the bailout condition.

* Add a comment about HostPortal in getHostSibling

* Revert the fix because I don't know why it worked

unmountHostComponents() should have worked despite finding the wrong parent because it should have changed the parent when pushing and popping the portals.

* Don't call commitDeletion recursively

This leads to a ""Cannot find host parent"" bug because commitDeletion() clears the return field.
When we're inside the loop, we assign node.sibling.return to node.return but by this moment node.return has already been nulled.
As a solution we inline code from commitDeletion() without the nulling.

It still fails tests but for a different reason (unrelated bug).

* Skip portal children in commitNestedUnmounts()

We are currently already visiting them in commitUnmount() portal case since it's recursive.
This condition avoids visting them twice.

* Set node.child.return before going deeper

It doesn't seem to influence existing tests but we have this protection in all other similar places.
It protects against infinite loops.

* Revert ""Fix the bug when switching to a null portal child""

This reverts commit ed9747deedf11455ba3eb65648007ab99c26ea58.

I'll solve this by using an array in place of null instead.

* Use [] for empty Portal pendingProps

This avoids a false positive bailout with pendingProps == null when portal is empty."

* Test that SVG elements get created with the right namespace

* Pass root to the renderer methods

* Keep track of host instances and containers

* Keep instances instead of fibers on the stack

* Create text instances in begin phase

* Create instance before bailing on offscreen children

Otherwise, the parent gets skipped next time.
We could probably create it later but this seems simpler.

* Tweak magic numbers in incremental tests

I don't understand why they changed but probably related to us moving some work into begin phase?

* Only push newly created nodes on the parent stack

Previously I was pushing nodes on the parent stack regardless of whether they were already in current or not.
As a result, insertions during updates were duplicated, and nodes were added to existing parents before commit phase.
Luckily we have a test that caught that.

* Fix lint

* Fix Flow

I had to wrap HostContext API into a closure so that it's parameterizeable with I and C.

* Use the same destructuring style in scheduler as everywhere else

* Remove branches that don't seem to run anymore

I'm not 100% sure this is right but I can't get tests to fail.

* Be explicit about the difference between type and tag

I was confused by th HACK comment so I learned how DOM and SVG work with casing and tried to write a more descriptive comment.
It also seems like passing fiber.type into finalizeInitialChildren() is a potential problem because DOM code assumes tag is lowercase.
So I added a similar ""hack"" to finalizeInitialChildren() that is identical to the one we have prepareUpdate() so if we fix them later, we fix both.

* Save and restore host context when pushing and popping portals

* Revert parent context and adding children in the begin phase

We can address this later separately as it is a more hot path.
This doesn't affect correctness of SVG container behavior.

* Add a test for SVG updates

This tests the ""jump"" reuse code path in particular.

* Record tests

* Read ownerDocument from the root container instance

This way createInstance() depends on the innermost container only for reading the namespace.

* Track namespaces instead of creating instances early

While we might want to create instance in the begin phase, we shouldn't let DOM guide reconciler design.
Instead, we are adding a new concept of ""host context"". In case of ReactDOMFiber, it's just the current namespace.
We are keeping a stack of host context values, ignoring those that are referentially equal.
The renderer receives the parent context and type, and can return a new context.

* Pop child context before reading own context and clarify API

It wasn't quite clear from the API which context was being returned by the renderer. Changed the API to specifically ask for child context, and thus to pop it before getting the current context.

This fixes the case with <foreignObject> to which I intended to give SVG namespace.

* Give SVG namespace to <svg> itself

* Don't allocate unnecessarily when reconciling portals

We create stacks lazily so that if portal doesn't contain <svg>s, we don't need to allocate.
We also reuse the same object for portal host context state instead of creating a new one every time.

* Add more tests for edge cases

* Fix up math namespace

* Maintain a separate container stack

* Fix rebase mistakes

* Unwind context on errors

* Reset the container state when reusing the object

* Add getChildHostContext() to ReactART

* Record tests"

This uncovered a separate issue where some errors were being unscheduled
and rescheduled multiple times before flushing. Turns out we need to
check both a fiber and its alternate when determining if it represents a
failed unit of work. I didn't notice this before because we were
scheduling a new update on *every* boundary at the end of the commit
phase, not just the ones that captured an error during that commit. I
updated the unit tests to catch this in the future."

We still need tryComponentWillUnmount because deletion should be non-
interruptible.

Refactoring the commit phase to better handle errors also allows us
to switch between fast and slow versions of the work loop. The slower
version runs whenever there are captured errors; it must check each
unit of work to see if it has failed. The faster version runs in the
normal case where there are no errors. Whenever an error is thrown, we
switch from the fast work loop to the slow work loop."

This makes it easier to track when we enter and exit a batch of work.

Further steps needed in this refactor:
- Get rid of tryComponentDidMount, tryComponentDidUpdate, etc. in
favor of the try-catch blocks that wrap each pass of the commit phase.
- Need to be able to switch between performing work that is possibly
failed (slower because it requires an extra check on each iteration) and
work that we know for sure has no errors."

* Exit early in scheduleUpdate if a node's priority matches

This is a performance optimization and is unobservable. However, it
helps protect against regressions on the following invariants on which
it relies:

- The priority of a fiber is greater than or equal to the priority of
all its descendent fibers.
- If a tree has pending work priority, its root is scheduled.

* New error boundary semantics

- Recovering from an error boundary no longer uses Task priority by
default. The work is scheduled using whatever priority created the
error.
- Error handling is now a side-effect that happens during the
commit phase.
- The default behavior of an error boundary is to render null. Errors
do not propagate except when an boundary fails. Conceptually, this would
be like throwing an error from a catch block.
- A host container is treated like a no-op error boundary. The first
error captured by a host container is thrown at the end of the batch.
Like with normal error boundaries, the entire tree is unmounted.

* Fix broken setState callback test

* Add test for ""unwinding"" context when an error interrupts rendering

* Switch over primary effect types only

This avoids the need to create an export for every combination of bits.

* Only continue the work loop if the error was successfully captured

* Add more tests for incremental error handling

These tests are currently failing:

  ✕ catches render error in a boundary during partial deferred mounting
  ✕ catches render error in a boundary during animation mounting
  ✕ propagates an error from a noop error boundary during full deferred mounting
  ✕ propagates an error from a noop error boundary during partial deferred mounting
  ✕ propagates an error from a noop error boundary during animation mounting

The observed behavior is that unstable_handleError() unexpected gets called twice:

      ""ErrorBoundary render success"",
      ""BrokenRender"",
      ""ErrorBoundary unstable_handleError"",
  +   ""ErrorBoundary render success"",
  +   ""BrokenRender"",
  +   ""ErrorBoundary unstable_handleError"",
      ""ErrorBoundary render error""

* Verify batched updates get scheduled despite errors

* Add try/catch/finally blocks around commit phase passes

We'll consolidate all these blocks in a future PR that refactors the
commit phase to be separate from the perform work loop.

* NoopBoundary -> RethrowBoundary

* Only throw uncaught error once there is no more work to perform

* Remove outdated comment

It was fixed in #8451.

* Record tests

* Always reset nextUnitOfWork on error

This is important so that the test at the end of performAndHandleErrors() knows it's safe to rethrow.

* Add a passing test for unmounting behavior on crashed tree

* Top-level errors

An error thrown from a host container should be ""captured"" by the host
container itself

* Remove outdated comment

* Separate Rethrow and Noop scenarios in boundary tests

* Move try block outside the commit loops"

* Add iterable cases to MultiChildReconcile test

Stack currently supports rendering iterables, but Fiber does not.

Previously we didn't have any public API tests for iterables. We have tests for traverseAllChildren() which is shared between React.Children and Stack. However Fiber doesn't currently use it, and likely won't. So this commit is a first step towards actually testing iterable support via public API. The next step will be to port traverseAllChildren() tests to test React.Children API instead.

* Implement iterable reconciliation in Fiber

This uses the same exact algorithm as array reconciliation but uses iterator to step through.

This gets reconcile tests to pass again but introduces a regression in ReactMultiChildText case which uses Maps as children. It passed before because Maps were ignored, but now it's failing because this actually runs the Map code path in Fiber. We can throw early in this case when we want to follow up on this.

* Rewrite traverseAllChildren() tests against React.Children API

This function was used in React.Children and Stack.

The corresponding reconciliation functionality is being tested by ReactMultiChild tests.

So we can move these tests to ReactChildren and test its public API."

However, since this can be nested fragments we end up searching the tree
anyway. We also have to manage this in transferOutput so it ends up being
as expensive. Maybe we can save some traversal for updates when coroutine

The goal of this is to avoid passing an opaque data structure that needs
to be recursively searched by the host.

I considered having some helper for doing the recursion but I figured it
might be helpful to let the reconciler move this around. For example we
might want to create an instance in beginWork and add to it as we go.
This would let us avoid traversing the tree twice and would solve the IE11
perf issue.

So instead, we create the instance first then call appendChild. I could
just call the normal one but I figured that I would make a special one
just in case. For example if you wanted to perform commits on a separate
thread from creation. This turned out to be useful in ReactNoop where I
can avoid searching the array for an existing one since I know the child
isn't there already. (Although splitting placement into insertion/move
might be better.)

Finally, we need the ability to update an instance after all the children
have been insertion. Such as `<select value={...} />`. I called this
finalizeInitialChildren."

This PR adds a first version of a declarative API meant to replace `ReactDOM.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer()`. The API is a declarative way to render subtrees into DOM node containers.

I came up with a contrived case of where nested controlled events could
fire within the same batch - but on different targets.

I think we came to the conclusion that controlled values typically cannot
use preventDefault so it is ok that they don't flush until after the event
has finished. So therefore we accumulate a queue of all the nested targets
within a batch and then restore state on all of them.

I'm still skeptical that this is the correct way to do controlled values.
The reason we have to do them in a single event loop is because when you
type, the sequence of values that get accepted or not can matter. I wonder
if there is a scenario we can come up with where you can fire multiple
inner events in an event loop and end up with batching causing problems.

This effectively just reimplements asap again but with no allocations for
a single target and no closure allocations."

* Attempt to fix ReactDOMTextComponent test in Fiber

Obviously, some tests pass but the reconciliation is still incomplete on this in Fiber.

Those changes just ignore reconciliation Comments while asserting (this fixes 2 tests already) but now shows that Fiber lacks some reconciliation features.

* Transmit a parentInstance to commitTextUpdate

This is done in case a Node#normalize() was performed on the parent instance and that the TextInstance got desolidarized from the parent. We provide the parent known by the parent Fiber to reattach the DOM node in this case.

* Added a more complex case around split nodes

This test does not assume one split node substitution alone but also some non-split nodes.

* Fiber supports split text nodes

This is done by suppressing nodes appearing during the split. this is based by comparing against the old value known by the Fiber.

* Simplify siblings cleaning in commitTextUpdate

No need to assert instanceof Text since the length comparator will work correctly.

* Ensure non-text nodes won't be removed

* Fix flow for Fiber Text reconciliation additions

Mostly define types as optionals. Respects the strict DOM API around Node & Element.

* Append at any stack stage only if necessary

The direct parent of the TextNode fiber may not contain the host node. We have to go through the hierarchy. However, since this work may be expensive, we only do it if absolutely necessary!

* Use tag & ReactTypeOfWork to find an HostComponent

* Addfailing scenario when running Node.normalize()

It happens when non-text-elements are added in the mix. @sebmarkbage seems to have an idea on how to fix it. This is just a repro of the bug!

* Register failing/passing fiber tests"

This gets rid of the global flag on if something has listened to onSelect
and instead reads the isListening map if all the events are covered.
This is required if we want to attach events locally at roots.

Could be slower perf wise to handle events. An alternative solution would
be to attach a special flag on the listener map for the document so we
don't have to check the full dependency list.

However, my favorite solution would be to just eagerly attach all event
listeners (except maybe wheel). Then we don't have to do any of this stuff
on a per element basis."

* Refactor scheduling functions and introduce Task priority

There was lots of duplication across all the scheduling functions. I
think we're far enough along that we can start trying to clean some
stuff up.

Also introduces a new priority level provisionally called Task priority.
This is for work that completes at the end of the current tick, after
the current batch of work has been committed. It's different from
Synchronous priority, which needs to complete immediately.

A full implementation of Task priority will follow. It will replace
the current batching solution.

* Implement Task priority

Task priority is similar to Synchronous priority. Both are flushed in
the current tick. Synchronous priority is flushed immediately (e.g. sync
work triggered by setState will flush before setState exits), where as
Task is flushed after the current batch of work is committed.

Currently used for batchedUpdates and nested sync updates. Task should
also be used for componentDidUpdate/Mount and error boundary work. I'll
add this in a later commit.

* Make error boundaries use Task Priority

I have all but one error fixed. Not sure how tricky the last one is,
but I'm cautiously optimistic. Pushing to show my current progress.

* Remove recursion from handleErrors

Changed the algorithm of handleErrors a bit to ensure that boundaries
are not revisited once they are acknowledged.

* Add incremental error boundary test

Discovered an edge case: a noop error boundary will break in incremental
mode unless you explicitly schedule an update.

* Refactor error boundaries in Fiber

* Simplify trapError() calls

The existing logic was written before we had a proper error handling system.

* Remove unnecessary flags

* Prevent performTaskWork recursion

* Be stricter about preventing recursion"

These two implementations are identical. Except for some
invariants for some reason.

Since this relies on an implementation detail of the internal
component tree rather than an implementation detail of the
renderer, we might as well merge them and remove the injection."

First we need to check if a component subtree is mounted at all.

If it is, we need to search down the fiber for the first host
node. However, we might be searching the ""work in progress""
instead of current.

One realization is that it doesn't matter if we search work in
progress or current if they're the same. They will generally be
the same unless there is an insertion pending or something in
the alternate tree was already deleted. So if we find one of
those cases, we switch to look in the alternate tree instead."

There are two cases where we have a Fiber that is not actually
mounted. Either it is part of a tree that has not yet been
inserted or it is part of a tree that was unmounted.

For the insertion case, we can check the parents to see if there
is any insertion effect pending along the parent path.

For deletions, we can now check if any of the return pointers
is null without actually being the root."

This doesn't deal with the fact that work is usually deferred
so this will return null for first render (except in sync tests).
It also doesn't deal with top levels being fragments etc.
It doesn't deal with the host instance type being a wrapper
around the public instance. This needs to be unified with refs
and findDOMNode better.

However, this does expose that we reactComponentExpect and
ReactTestUtils doesn't work very well with Fiber."

E.g. constructor -> componentWillMount -> shouldComponentUpdate

If shouldComponentUpdate returns true then we create a new

componentWillReceiveProps without being mounted.

Another strange thing is that the ""previous props and state""

* Use the memoized props/state from the workInProgress

We don't want to use the ""current"" props/state because if we have
started work, then pause and continue then we'll have the newer

same as current.

* Deprioritize setState within a deprioritized tree

Currently we flag the path to a setState as a higher priority
than ""offscreen"". When we reconcile down this tree we bail out
if it is a hidden node. However, in the case that node is already
completed we don't hit that bail out path. We end up doing the
work immediately which ends up committing that part of the tree
at a higher priority.

This ensures that we don't let a deprioritized subtree get
reconciled at a higher priority.

* Bump idx in unit test

This proves that this number is actually deprioritized."

* Initial pass at the easy case of updates (updates that start at the root).

* Don't expect an extra componentWillUnmount call

It was fixed in #6613.

* Remove duplicate expectations from the test

* Fix style issues

* Make naming consistent throughout the tests

* receiveComponent() does not accept safely argument

* Assert that lifecycle and refs fire for error message

* Add more tests for mounting

* Do not call componentWillMount twice on error boundary

* Document more of existing behavior in tests

* Do not call componentWillUnmount() when aborting mounting

Previously, we would call componentWillUnmount() safely on the tree whenever we abort mounting it. However this is likely risky because the tree was never mounted in the first place.

People shouldn't hold resources in componentWillMount() so it's safe to say that we can skip componentWillUnmount() if componentDidMount() was never called.

Here, we introduce a new flag. If we abort during mounting, we will not call componentWillUnmount(). However if we abort during an update, it is safe to call componentWillUnmount() because the previous tree has been mounted by now.

* Consistently display error messages in tests

* Add more logging to tests and remove redundant one

* Refactor tests

* Split complicated tests into smaller ones

* Assert clean unmounting

* Add assertions about update hooks

* Add more tests to document existing behavior and remove irrelevant details

* Verify we can recover from error state

* Fix lint

* Error in boundary’s componentWillMount should propagate up

This test is currently failing.

* Move calling componentWillMount() into mountComponent()

This removes the unnecessary non-recursive skipLifecycle check.
It fixes the previously failing test that verifies that if a boundary throws in its own componentWillMount(), the error will propagate.

* Remove extra whitespace"

Use the newly added tracking system to track the number of fiber tests that are passing/failing.

I first tried to modify the grunt lint rule for it and send the output in stdout but unfortunately grunt displays the rule + done messages there. I had like 30 lines of js already and I figured I could just write 3 lines of bash and it would work the same. Let me know if you want me to use another approach for it.

Test Plan:
Run the commands that have been introduced in this commit but the facts-tracker one
Run `echo $FIBER_TESTS` and make sure it prints `666/1434`"

* Introduce facts-tracker

We want to be able to track various things like number of files that are flowified, number of tests passing with Fiber...

This introduces a tool that lets you do that. The API is very simple, you execute the script with a list of tuples [key value] and it's going to create a `facts` branch and put a txt file for each fact and values over time.

```
node scripts/facts-tracker/index.js \
  ""flow-files"" ""$COUNT_WITH_FLOW/$COUNT_ALL_FILES""
```

Test Plan:
This is tricky to test because Travis only exposes the private variables (github token) when it processes a committed file and not on branches. The reason is that otherwise anyone could send a pull requests that does `echo $GITHUB_TOKEN` and steal your token.

Given this constraint, I did all the work using two of my repos:
- https://github.com/vjeux/facts-tracker
- https://github.com/vjeux/facts-tracker-test

and am sending this pull request that should work as is /fingers crossed/, but we won't be able to test it out until it is committed.

Note that once this lands, I'm going to kill those two repos.

* Update with all the suggested changes

* Branch on a flow type in travis.yml

* Use $GITHUB_TOKEN

* properly escape it"

* High priority work

Adds the ability to schedule and perform high priority work. In the
noop renderer, this is exposed using a method `performHighPriWork(fn)`
where the function is executed and all updates in that scope are given
high priority.

To do this, the scheduler keeps track of a default priority level.
A new function `performWithPriority(priority, fn)` changes the default
priority before calling the function, then resets it afterwards.

* Rename overloaded priority terms

""High"" and ""low"" priority are overloaded terms. There are priority
levels called HighPriority and LowPriority. Meanwhile, there are
functions called {perform,schedule}HighPriWork, which corresponds
to requestAnimationFrame, and {perform,schedule}LowPriWork, which
corresponds to requestIdleCallback. But in fact, work that has
HighPriority is meant to be scheduled with requestIdleCallback.
This is super confusing.

To address this, {perform,schedule}HighPriWork has been renamed
to {perform,schedule}AnimationWork, and
{perform,schedule}LowPriWork has been renamed to
{perform,schedule}DeferredWork. HighPriority and LowPriority
remain the same.

* Priority levels merge fix"

we can try to find a smarter way to do this later. E.g. passing

we're finding work to do in the ""current"" tree instead of the

- Renamed file from 'ReactSynteticEvent' to 'ReactSyntheticEventType'
- Fills in the 'any' holes that were left in DispatchConfig type and the
  type annotations in EventPluginRegistry.
- Adds polymorphic PluginModule type and related types
- Uses hack to support indexable properties on 'Touch' type in
  TapEventPlugin

The issue in TapEventPlugin is that the code is accessing one of four
possible properties on the 'Touch' type native event using the bracket
accessor. Classes in Flow don't support using the bracket accessor,
unless you use a declaration and the syntax `[key: Type]: Type`.[1] The
downside of using that here is that we create a global type, which we
may not need in other files.

[1]: https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/1323

Other options:
- Use looser typing or a '@FixMe' comment and open an issue with Flow to
  support indexing on regular classes.
- Rewrite TapEventPlugin to not use the bracket accessor on 'Touch'. I
  thought the current implementation was elegant and didn't want to
  change it. But we could do something like this:
```
 if (nativeEvent.pageX || nativeEvent.pageY) {
   return axis.page === 'pageX' ? nativeEvent.pageX : nativeEvent.pageY;
 } else {
   var clientAxis = axis.client === 'clientX' ? nativeEvent.clientX : nativeEvent.clientY;
   return nativeEvent[axis.client] + ViewportMetrics[axis.envScroll];
 }

This commit takes the first incremental step towards adding type checks
to the React event code. A couple of issues came up.

There is an issue with the SyntheticEvent type: Flow declares a
SyntheticEvent type[1] that lacks the non-public properties which are
used in React internals. To solve this I declared a class that extends
SyntheticEvent. This class can be expanded as we add Flow types to more
places where SyntheticEvent instances are referenced.

I'm happy to change this if folks prefer a different approach.
Some options I considered:
- Override the SyntheticEvent declaration with our own declaration
  - Pro: We can use 'SyntheticEvent' as a type just like we are used to
    when working in any other codebase.
  - Pro: No need to import any type since it's a declaration
  - Pro: Only one version of SyntheticEvent; less confusion.
  - Con: Could get out of sync with real implementation.
  - Con: Duplicates part of the type declared in Flow.
- Import the SyntheticEvent class and use that as the type
  - Pro: Keeps type definition in sync with the real implementation.
  - Con: Declaration overrides implementation so I'm not sure this would
    work.
  - Con: Have to remember to import the type.
- Declare a separate type called ReactSyntheticEvent that extends
  SyntheticEvent
  - Pro: Stays in sync with the Flow SyntheticEvent type;
    less duplication.
  - Pro: Differentiates this type from the Flow SyntheticEvent type;
    less confusion.
  - Pro: No need to import any type since it's a declaration
  - Con: Could get out of sync with real implementation.

I also ran into an issue where a variable was only non-null when
'__DEV__' is true, similar to PR #7586.[2] The work-around is to force
it to be typed non-null and add a comment documenting the reason. At
this time Flow doesn't have a better way to deal with the situation.

Next steps:
- Specific type for the 'dispatchConfig' property of SyntheticEvent
- More detailed types for PluginName and PluginModule

Lastly; note that I renamed some variables to follow the convention of
reserving PascalCase for classes, enums, and Flow types.

This is the last callsite of keyMirror! It removes 0.5k gzipped :)

The only trick with this one is that ReactTestUtils actually iterates over the list of all the events. Instead of duplicating the logic, I used the $Enum feature of flow that lets us statically extract out the type from the dynamic value. Inside of react-dom we're no longer requiring the file directly so it doesn't bloat the file size, and we still get to have static typing, best of both worlds!"

This one is interesting because we have transaction objects being passed around everywhere in the codebase but there's actually no Transaction class. It's a ""mixin"" that comes to life by being Object.assigned to the prototype of a real ""class"" (before class was cool!). Therefore, we can't just say `var Transaction = require('Transaction'); (transaction: Transaction) => { }` because it would be the object that contains a mixin and not an instance of a transaction.

The trick I use is to export `TransactionType` and alias it to `Transaction` in the file as it doesn't actually require transaction. In case they do, we'll figure it out, but in the few files I looked at, it doesn't seem to be the case.

For the perform function, it actually typechecks pretty well!"

it passes, but the idea is to run all three variants in travis.

I'm not sure that invoking rAF and rIC synchronously is the best
way to test this since it doesn't capture the backwards

renderSubtreeIntoContainer is only used by the DOM renderer.
It's not an addon.

ReactClass isn't needed as a dependency since injection doesn't
happen anymore.

* Use a shim file to load addons' dependencies on DOM

By replacing this intermediate file we can do the lazy loading
without needing any lazy requires. This set up works with ES
modules.

We could also replace the globalShim thing with aliased files
instead for consistency.

* Bundle DOM renderers into their individual UMD bundles

Instead of exposing the entire DOM renderer on the react.js
package, I only expose CurrentOwner and ComponentTreeDevtool which
are currently the only two modules that share __state__ with the
renderers.

Then I package each renderer in its own package. That could allow
us to drop more server dependencies from the client package. It
will also allow us to ship fiber as a separate renderer.

react-dom.min.js          149kb     1kb
react-dom-server.min.js   144kb     1kb

The total size for react.min.js + react-dom.min.js is +19kb larger
because of the overlap between them right now. I'd like to see
what an optimizing compiler can do to this. Some of that is fbjs
stuff. There shouldn't need to be that much overlap so that's
something we can hunt. We should keep isomorphic absolutely
minimal so there's no reason for other React clones not to use it.
There will be less overlap with Fiber.

However, another strategy that we could do is package the
isomorphic package into each renderer bundle and conditionally
initialize it if it hasn't already been initialized. That way
you only pay an overlap tax when there are two renderers on the
page but not without it. It's also easier to just pull in one
package. The downside is the versioning stuff that the separate
npm package would solve. That applies to CDNs as well.

ReactWithAddons is a bit weird because it is packaged into the
isomorphic package but has a bunch of DOM dependencies. So we have
to load them lazily since the DOM package gets initialized after."

This took a while to figure out, but we need to be able to store
children that are currently being worked on separately from the
current children. We always need a canonical ""current"" children
so that we can update them. However, we also need a different set
that we're currently working on so that we have a way to get to
already progressed work.

This solve the starvation problem in the first render because now
we can reach children that were never rendered and have a place
to store their progressed work on. The unit test changes tests
this.

This lets us get rid of the hasWorkInProgress flag.

When we reconcile new children we need to reconcile them against
progressed work so that we can reuse it. The progressed work is
""work in progress"" nodes. So in that case we need to mutate
instead of clone, to preserve the invariant that only two versions
exist at any given point. This effectively forks the
ReactChildFiber implementation."

* PropTypes: distinguish nullable from optional object field

This gives a more precise message (no type semantics change) to the case of passing a field in an object, but whose value is `null`:

Before:

```js
propTypes: {
  foo: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired
}
```

Would scream ""Required prop `foo` was not specified in `MyComp`"".

Now it'll be ""Required prop `foo` was specified in `MyComp`, but its value is `null`."".

Works as expected in nested objects.

This fixes the issue of a component transitively passing a `null`, specifying the correct field to the child but have the child tell it that it didn't provide the prop.

Optional field and nullable are two different things anyway.

Full list of changes is at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/2-to-3/. The tl;dr of it is:
 - Relative permalinks were removed, so all the files in the `docs` subdirectory need their permalink to be prefixed with `docs/`
 - `post` and `page` types were renamed to `posts` and `pages` respectively
 - `jekyll-paginate`, `pygments` and `redcarpet` are all now optional, so I needed to explicitly add it to the Gemfile. Jekyll now uses `rouge` rather than `pygments` for syntax highlighting, but rouge does not support highlighting individual lines (`hl_lines`) so we need to continue using Pygments.
 - Layout metadata (eg. `sectionid`) is now on a `layout` variable rather than `page`

Tested the following pages and confirmed that they all work:
 - ""Docs"" link (getting started page): http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/docs/getting-started.html
 - Downloads: http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/downloads.html
 - Tutorial: http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/docs/tutorial.html
 - A few pages under the ""docs"" subdirectory, to confirm they're working properly:
    - http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/docs/addons.html
 - http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/docs/why-react.html
 - http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/docs/create-fragment.html
 - A few tips:
    - http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/tips/false-in-jsx.html
 - http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/tips/style-props-value-px.html
 - Non-English versions of the page:

Previously, the extract-components script would create the same number of layers of composites as the page it captures, but it would output a new class for each time any composite is used (since we don't want to replicate all the component logic).

I changed the script to output a single type for each type in the input -- and each generated component takes an index for which output it should return. This should be closer to how the original code behaves, especially with respect to VM function call lookups where the amount of polymorphism makes a difference.

I re-recorded the benchmarks with the new scripts. They run significantly faster:

```
Comparing old.txt (control) vs new.txt (test)
Significant differences marked by ***
% change from control to test, with 99% CIs:

* ssr_pe_cold_ms_jsc_jit
    % change: -41.73% [-43.37%, -40.09%]  ***
    means: 39.3191 (control), 22.9127 (test)
* ssr_pe_cold_ms_jsc_nojit
    % change: -44.24% [-46.69%, -41.80%]  ***
    means: 45.8646 (control), 25.5764 (test)
* ssr_pe_cold_ms_node
    % change: -45.61% [-47.38%, -43.85%]  ***
    means: 90.1118 (control), 49.0116 (test)
```

This is probably in part due to the changes here, but also the page I captured has changed somewhat in the meantime and there seem to be slightly fewer components in the hierarchy, so they're not really comparable. But going forward we can use this benchmark which should be more accurate. I also included an identical copy that uses stateless functional components so we can test optimizations to those later."

Touch behavior is inconsistent across different platforms, and ResponderTouchHistoryStore currently fatals when assumptions are broken. In addition, the behavior differs between development and production.

This pull request does a few things to make ResponderTouchHistoryStore easier to deal with:

Adds Flow to keep the TouchEvent, Touch, and TouchRecord types straight.
Changes behavior to be consistent across environments. This means either always throwing or never throwing (and making use of warning and console.error as appropriate).
When an orphaned move or end event is received, print debug information and ignore it instead of crashing and burning."

Summary:

I had to cast into any because flow doesn't think that checking the lowercase version of nodeName is a valid way to refine the variable from HTMLElement to HTMLInputElement. I'm also not confident enough in changing the implementation to an instanceof HTMLInputElement to please flow. It also takes care of the null check in the process.

The `nodeName &&` condition wasn't useful since the two branches are checking it against concrete values and actually makes the type different since nodeName is not a boolean per se. I replaced them with if conditions to make it clearer what it actually did instead of doing boolean logic tricks.

It is unclear why I had to type supportedInputTypes, see this internal post for a discussion: https://www.facebook.com/groups/flowtype/permalink/1084168611631753/

The only difference in behavior is that I now explicitely convert to boolean the object dereference via `!!`.

* Resolve refs in the order of the children

React makes no guarantees about ref resolution order. Unfortunately, some of the internal Facebook component APIs (specifically, layer dialogs) currently depend on the ref resolution order. Specifically, the assumption is that if the layer dialog is placed as a last child, by the time it mounts or updates, the refs to any previously declared elements have been resolved.

With the current `ReactMultiChild`, this is *usually* the case but not always. Both initial mount and an update of all components satisfy this assumption: by the time a child mounts or updates, the previous children’s refs have been resolved. The one scenario where it isn’t true is when **a new child is mounted during an update**.

In this case, the `mountComponent()` call used to be delayed until `ReactMultiChild` processes the queue. However, this is inconsistent with how updates normally work: unlike mounting, updating and unmounting happens inside `ReactChildReconciler.updateChildren()` loop.

This PR changes the `mountComponent()` to be performed inside `ReactChildReconciler`, just like `receiveComponent()` and `unmountComponent()`, and thus ensures that `attachRef()` calls are enqueued in the order the children were processed, so by the time the next child flushes, the refs of the previous children have been resolved.

This is not ideal and will probably be broken by incremental reconciler in the future. However, since we are trying to get rid of mixins in the internal codebase, and layered components are one of the biggest blockers to that, it’s lesser evil to temporarily make ref resolution order more strict until we have time to fix up the layer APIs to not rely on it, and are able to relax it again (which would be a breaking change).

This caused both me and a hallway tester to do a double take.

The proposed reformulation allows the answers to follow the same template.

In the same spirit, it uses the same contraction pattern in the last answer (`it's not state`-> `it isn't state`). This has the welcome side effect to make the lack of ""probably"" stand out more.

This avoids using .alternate as much as possible and isolates it
to the root. For anything that is ""work in progress"" this happens
to be the same as the alternate field. To avoid an extra ""current""
field on work in progress fibers, we can just use the alternate.

The timing for when this is true might be a bit tricky to reason
about so I explicitly pass the current value everywhere from the
top. That way we can always change this in the future to use an
explicit field or we can try to maintain a parallel data
structure that remembers which was the ""current"" fiber for each
wip child."

[Fiber] Add support for simple updates and fiber pooling"

These values represent fibers that are incomplete. In the current
model they're mutated in place. In a completely immutable model
they would need to be cloned for every step they make progress.
I.e. one where the child is still in this WIP state and one when
it is complete.

To clarify this I'll name them workInProgress while they're in
that state, which is also what Jordan did in his prototype."

This splits the Fiber type into Fiber and Instance. This could be
two different object instances to save memory. However, to avoid
GC thrash I merge them into one.

When ReactChildFiber reconciles children, it clones the previous
fiber. This creates a new tree for work-in-progress. The idea is
that once flushed, this new tree will be used at the root.

However, we know that we'll never need more than two trees
at a time. Therefore my clone function stores the clone on the
original. Effectively this creates a fiber pool.

Ideally, the .alternate field shouldn't be used outside of clone
so that everything can work with pure immutability. I cheat a bit
for now so I don't have to pass both trees everywhere.

ReactChildFiber is a bit hacky for reuse and doesn't solve all
cases. Will fix that once I try to get parity."

* Don't count the time inside flushes towards lifecycle hooks

Fixes #6842.

We keep the existing behavior of testing for matching `onBeginLifeCycleTimer`/`onEndLifeCycleTimer` calls, but we push the current timer onto the stack if we enter a flush.
This solves an issue with portals which cause updates while a lifecycle timer is already running.

I chose to subtract the time spent in the flush from the time counted towards the lifecycle method because it would artificially inflate the “total” time of the component due to all the components inside the portal, so it would skew the exclusive table.

One of the ReactMultiChildText tests renders 2145 roots (and even more components) and unmounts none of them. Now we don't loop through them all a bunch of times so the test takes 20 seconds instead of 60.

We should clean up instantiateReactComponent somehow so that the onSetDisplayName call isn't produced for the TopLevelWrapper, which should allow us to just store an array of unmountedIDs instead of a hash map so we at least don't have double maps. This change mirrors the old logic though.

`ReactDebugTool` used to only call `purgeUnmountedComponents()` while profiling, so information about unmounted instances kept accumulating when not profiling.

Additionally, unmounting in React Native and rendering to string did not correctly clean up the devtool.

Finally, the tests tested the wrong behavior and relied on explicit `purgeUnmountedComponent()` calls.

To fix this, we:

* Test specifically that unmounting is enough to clean up the tree devtool.
* Add missing `onBeginFlush` and `onEndFlush` calls to server and native rendering so `ReactDebugTool` knows when to copy the tree.

ReactDOMInput and a few other classes handle change event by scheduling updateWrapper() in an asap().
It gets executed after the batch, which confuses ReactPerf that expects all DOM writes to happen during a batch.
Since this implementation of ReactPerf relying on the stack is going away, let's plug the hole temporarily by ignoring DOM writes that occur during postponed updateWrapper(). In any case, they have no relation to actual calculations of wasted renders, as they don't occur due to updateComponent(), but rather due to onChange() special DOM behavior.

There seems to be a bug with medikoo/es6-symbol where the global state
affects the implementation of the polyfill. I found this by running the
individual test file alone then running all the tests using `grunt
test`. I found that it passes when ran alone and failed when ran
collectively.

I did not find this buggy behavior with zloirock/core-js's
implementation of a polyfill for Symbol. Thus, removing I will keep the
more popular polyfill (core-js) and remove the buggy polyfill
(es6-symbol).

If you are reading this and can think of a confounding factor that is
causing this bug, please let me know and we can try to work together to
add support for medikoo/es6-symbol."

This PR is the first in a series of pull requests split from the new `ReactPerf` implementation in #6046.

Here, we introduce a new module called `ReactDebugInstanceMap`. It will be used in `__DEV__` and, when the `__PROFILE__` gate is added, in the `__PROFILE__` builds. It will *not* be used in the production builds.

This module acts as a mapping between “debug IDs” (a new concept) and the internal instances. Not to be confused with the existing `ReactInstanceMap` that maps internal instances to public instances.

What are the “debug IDs” and why do we need them? Both the new `ReactPerf` and other consumers of the devtool API, such as React DevTools, need access to some data from the internal instances, such as the instance type display name, current props and children, and so on. Right now we let such tools access internal instances directly but this hurts our ability to refactor their implementations and burdens React DevTools with undesired implementation details such as having to support React ART in a special way.[1]

The purpose of adding `ReactDebugInstanceMap` is to only expose “debug IDs” instead of the internal instances to any devtools. In a future RP, whenever there is an event such as mounting, updating, or unmounting a component, we will emit an event in `ReactDebugTool` with the debug ID of the instance. We will also add an introspection API that lets the consumer pass an ID and get the information about the current children, props, state, display name, and so on, without exposing the internal instances.

`ReactDebugInstanceMap` has a concept of “registering” an instance. We plan to add the hooks that register an instance as soon as it is created, and unregister it during unmounting. It will only be possible to read information about the instance while it is still registered. If we add support for reparenting, we should be able to move the (un)registration code to different places in the component lifecycle without changing this code. The currently registered instances are held in the `registeredInstancesByIDs` dictionary.

There is also a reverse lookup dictionary called `allInstancesToIDs` which maps instances back to their IDs. It is implemented as a `WeakMap` so the keys are stable and we’re not holding onto the unregistered instances. If we’re not happy with `WeakMap`, one possible alternative would be to add a new field called `_debugID` to all the internal instances, but we don’t want to do this in production. Using `WeakMap` seems like a simpler solution here (and stable IDs are a nice bonus). This, however, means that the `__DEV__` (and the future `__PROFILE__`) builds will only work in browsers that support our usage of `WeakMap`.

Algolia adds two inline styles

```css

to the element once the script inserted at the end of the page runs which super slightly moves the header. The fix is to always apply those two rules this way it doesn't jump. I did not notice it on my machine because it doesn't move when custom fonts are not being used.

Test Plan:
- Open two tabs: reactjs.com and localhost:4000/react
- Click around on reactjs.com to prime the cache with the fonts
- Switch tabs and click around on localhost (but do not force refresh!)
- Now you get custom fonts loaded locally and it doesn't jump when you change tabs"

This makes things easier if we ever want to use more than one DOM node for a component. Notably, this is more convenient if we want to remove the wrappers around text components (since text nodes can be split and joined however a browser feels like) or if we want to support returning more than one element from render (#2127).

I left the old indexes so that implementations aren't forced to use the node/image if they prefer indices, because I'm not sure yet whether the changes corresponding to my rewrite of DOMChildrenOperations are easy or hard yet in React Native.

All attributes defined on SVG elements will now be passed directly regardless of the whitelist. The casing specified by user will be preserved, and setAttribute() will be used.

In the future we will remove support for the camel case aliases to the hyphenated attributes. For example, we currently map `strokeWidth` to `stroke-width` but this is now deprecated behind a warning. When we remove support for this we can remove some of the code paths introduced in this commit.

The purpose of this change is to stop maintaining a separate SVG property config. The config still exists for two purposes:

* Allow a migration path for deprecated camelcased versions of hyphenated SVG attributes
* Track special namespaced attributes (they still require a whitelist)

However it is no longer a blocker for using new non-namespaced SVG attributes, and users don't have to ask us to add them to the whitelist.

Avoid negative lookahead in regular expression"

I'm trying to use React with otto
(https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto), which is implemented in Go and
does not support lookaheads or backreferences in regular expressions.
(Unfortunately that *does* mean that otto isn't fully compatible with
the ECMA5 spec; but since this is the only lookahead I am aware of in
the React codebase, this change makes React once again compatible with
otto, and any other JS implementation that may not be fully compliant on
regular expressions).

As far as I can tell, the previous code replaced a sequence of slash
characters with one more slash than before. The new code avoids the
negative lookahead by matching any sequence of slash characters and then
using the special `$&` placeholder to replace the matched sequence with
the original sequence, plus one more slash."

According to react documentation it is advised to: 
NEVER mutate this.state directly, as calling setState() afterwards may replace the mutation you made. Treat this.state as if it were immutable.
https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html

In this particular case it is probably doesn't matter since setState is called directly after mutation, but it does provide a bad example of state mutation.

Another way of removing an item from an array can be `newItems = this.state.slice(0,i).concat(this.state.slice(i+1))` however the meaning can be less obvious to some."

This uses wall-clock time (for now) so it's noisier than alternatives
(cachegrind, CPU perf-counters), but it's still valuable. In a future diff we
can make it use those.

`measure.py` outputs something that `analyze.py` can understand, but you can use `analyze.py` without `measure.py` too. The file format is simple:

```

sophiebits,2015-11-05 00:33:03,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/9419976e519bb7bda297dd4b57054a5942ddf8e8,9419976e519bb7bda297dd4b57054a5942ddf8e8,"Revert #4993 with an added test for refs

We were shallow-rendering a component that used refs at FB so this can't go in as-is. It's a little unclear what we _should_ do though, since there is nothing to hold a ref to (since we're shallowly rendering) and we generally promise that child refs are resolved before a parent's componentDidMount. Also, changing shallow rendering to use the original `_renderValidatedComponent` (instead of `_renderValidatedComponentWithoutOwnerOrContext`) breaks tests because now the `_owner` field doesn't match up for `toEqual` (non-null in `getRenderOutput` but null if constructed in a test)."

New module! With this, we have a new module that uses the component tree to store DOM nodes. Most of the logic in this file relates to markup adoption -- if we were to drop that (along with server rendering) this file could just be a `return inst._nativeNode;`.

This works with useCreateElement only because we need to reference each node as it's created.

Events is now the only thing using ReactMount.getNode -- I'll introduce pointers back from the DOM nodes (and a `ReactDOMComponentTree.getInstanceFromNode`) and make that work."

Is this all of them? I hope so.

- Set text content after creating hierarchy, like the text is a child. I should've done this originally but I guessed it wouldn't matter. I was wrong (~20% perf difference in IE11).
- IE throws when setting an enum-like property to an invalid value. I tried setting every property to the string 'a' and changed the ones that threw to be MUST_USE_ATTRIBUTE. I think these are all correct -- encType is the most suspicious one based on the existing comments but I tested in IE8 and it works fine as an attribute."

My last strategy of getting each node recursively while unmounting was a pain to make work properly with ReactMount's confusing cache. Now, we get the node before unmounting anything in the subtree (and we don't try to find the nodes of descendants).

This is a temporary solution and can go away when we get rid of the giant ReactMount node hash map.

The only globals you get are `print` and `PerfCounters`. No `console` nor the other globals provided by the `jsc` command-line tool (load, readFile, etc) though they're probably not hard to implement.

You can disable the JIT by setting the environment variable `JSC_useJIT=false`.

Test Plan:
```
~/local/react/scripts/perf-counters$ make
~/local/react/scripts/perf-counters$ build/jsc-perf <(echo 'PerfCounters.init(); var a = PerfCounters.getCounters().instructions; print(""moo""); var b = PerfCounters.getCounters().instructions; print(b - a);')

Use a Symbol to tag every ReactElement"
sebmarkbage,2015-09-10 06:19:00,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/031fc24daeae6bcdc5e5f6959b778e1c2ed5f378,031fc24daeae6bcdc5e5f6959b778e1c2ed5f378,"Use a Symbol to tag every ReactElement

Fixes #3473

I tag each React element with `$$typeof: Symbol.for('react.element')`. We need
this to be able to safely distinguish these from plain objects that might have
come from user provided JSON.

The idiomatic JavaScript way of tagging an object is for it to inherent some
prototype and then use `instanceof` to test for it.

However, this has limitations since it doesn't work with value types which
require `typeof` checks. They also don't work across realms. Which is why there
are alternative tag checks like `Array.isArray` or the `toStringTag`. Another
problem is that different instances of React that might have been created not knowing about eachother. npm tends to make this kind of problem occur a lot.

Additionally, it is our hope that ReactElement will one day be specified in
terms of a ""Value Type"" style record instead of a plain Object.

This Value Types proposal by @nikomatsakis is currently on hold but does satisfy all these requirements:

https://github.com/nikomatsakis/typed-objects-explainer/blob/master/valuetypes.md#the-typeof-operator

Additionally, there is already a system for coordinating tags across module
systems and even realms in ES6. Namely using `Symbol.for`.

Currently these objects are not able to transfer between Workers but there is
nothing preventing that from being possible in the future. You could imagine
even `Symbol.for` working across Worker boundaries. You could also build a
system that coordinates Symbols and Value Types from server to client or through
serialized forms. That's beyond the scope of React itself, and if it was built
it seems like it would belong with the `Symbol` system. A system could override
the `Symbol.for('react.element')` to return a plain yet
cryptographically random or unique number. That would allow ReactElements to
pass through JSON without risking the XSS issue.

The fallback solution is a plain well-known number. This makes it unsafe with
regard to the XSS issue described in #3473. We could have used a much more
convoluted solution to protect against JSON specifically but that would require
some kind of significant coordination, or change the check to do a
`typeof element.$$typeof === 'function'` check which would not make it unique to
React. It seems cleaner to just use a fixed number since the protection is just
a secondary layer anyway. I'm not sure if this is the right tradeoff.

In short, if you want the XSS protection, use a proper Symbol polyfill.

Finally, the reason for calling it `$$typeof` is to avoid confusion with `.type`
and the use case is to add a tag that the `typeof` operator would refer to.
I would use `@@typeof` but that seems to deopt in JSC. I also don't use
`__typeof` because this is more than a framework private. It should really be
part of the polyfilling layer."

avoid the phrase ""key property"""

React components can be assigned a special property named `key`. Therefore, it's helpful to avoid the phrase ""key property"" unless you're talking about the `key` property :)

I'm not sold on the replacement phrase, though... I think it's solid, but two fancy words like ""fundamental"" and ""invariant"" next to each other just seem a bit unwelcoming xP then again, we're talking about some heavy technical stuff; if there aren't any lighter words that are equally precise, then these should probably stand."

Robust animation-end handling in ReactCSSTransitionGroup"

As discussed in issue 1326
(https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1326) transitionend events are
unreliable; they may not fire because the element is no longer painted,
the browser tab is no longer focused or for a range of other reasons.
This is particularly harmful during leave transitions since the leaving
element will be permanently stuck in the DOM (and possibly visible).

The ReactCSSTransitionGroup now requires timeouts to be passed in
explicitly for each type of animation. Omitting the timeout duration
for a transition now triggers a PropTypes warning with a link to the
updated documentation."

Turns out jest is _incredibly_ slow at resolving require paths like `require('fbjs/lib/foo')`. Like several milliseconds per require. Really adds up when all our files require `invariant` and `warning`. Here's a temporary hack to make things fast again.

Test Plan:
```
npm test src/renderers/shared/reconciler/__tests__/ReactCompositeComponent-test.js
```

has a self-proclaimed runtime of ~8 seconds now instead of ~35 seconds."

This wraps a proper guard around event dispatching so that errors doesn't
interupt other event callbacks.

Instead we rethrow the first error after all callbacks have been invoked.

For DEV mode we use native event dispatching if available. This has the
benefit that caught exceptions show up in the dev tools even without caught
exceptions being turned on. Yet, all callbacks are guaranteed to fire."

With this, ReactMultiChild handles all of the children-related operations for ReactDOMComponent so that we don't process operations out of order. This is necessary because ReactMultiChild does its own batching so there's no way without its cooperation to get the timing right here.

Ideally we'll factor this logic out a bit better in subsequent updates but this is the simplest way to fix #1232 which has embarrassingly been open for over a year."

We keep track of the fact that something is rendering for a bunch of

@spicyj

I think completely removing warnAndMonitorForKeyUse is a bit difficult, without
duplicating a ton of code. This at least ensures that the format string passed
to `warning` is unique. Plus, because the FB internal code in question only
matches the beginning of the format string, I think there should be zero
internal changes that need to be made to support this refactor."

The `warning` implementation checked that the message is long enough to

It makes more sense to move this into a lint rule, and also to apply it

`warning` implementation as we replace the function internally anyways.

The rule itself is pretty straightforward, although adding the tests
ended up being a bit painful, as eslint-tester depends on mocha, and
therefore needs to be run in a separate grunt task."

Reorganize Src Directory for Isomorphic React Package"
sebmarkbage,2015-05-16 01:35:22,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/0b063f8a09dae4b6b1de400ff2d9aba9108647de,0b063f8a09dae4b6b1de400ff2d9aba9108647de,"Reorganize Src Files for Isomorphic React Package

The new folder structure is organized around major packages that are expected to ship separately in some form.

`/isomorphic`

I moved classic/modern and children utils into a directory called ""isomorphic"" with the main export being ReactIsomorphic. This will eventually become the ""react"" package.

This includes all the dependencies that you might need to create a component without dependencies on the renderer/reconciler.

The rest moves into decoupled renderers.

`/renderers/dom/client` - This is the main renderer for DOM.

`/renderers/dom/server` - This is the server-side renderer for HTML strings.

`/addons` and `/test` - Same as before for now.

You're not supposed to take on a dependency inside another package.

Shared code is organized into a ""shared"" directory which is intended to support all the packages in that subdirectory. Meaning that once we swap to CommonJS modules, the only time you should use `..` is to target `../shared/` or `../../shared`.

E.g. `/shared/` is common utils that are used by everything.

`/renderers/shared/` is code that is shared by all renderers, such as the main reconciliation algorithm.

Shared code will likely be copied into each package rather than referenced. This allow us to have separate state and allow inlining and deadcode elimination."

Update links to use https:// where it is supported. There's probably a lot
more that could be fixed, but these are the core ones I found (especially
the download links in order to prevent MITM attacks). Note that there are
some fb.me links that will redirect to http:// even while accessed over
https://, but this seemed like the best way to fix those for now.

NOTE: Only non-third-party files were modified. There are references to
http:// URLs in vendored/third-party files, but seems appropriate to fix
upstream for those rather than editing the files.

Also, copy one image locally to the blog, as it was hotlinking to a site
that did not support https://.

Last, use youtube-nocookie.com instead of youtube.com for video embeds,
as the former doesn't try to set a cookie on load (privacy enhancement)."

If there are no listeners for `onSelect` yet, do not extract events. This way we can avoid issues where listeners have been set up for some event dependencies for `SelectEventPlugin`, but not all.

For instance, if `topMouseDown` has been registered but not `topMouseUp`, event extraction will set the `mouseDown` flag to true but never unset it. This leads to bugs when `onSelect` is registered and should be firing during normal key behavior. Since no `topMouseUp` has yet occurred to unset the flag, `onSelect` fails to fire."

Turns out lots of people write invalid HTML all the time and no one, including your browser or React, cares. Most invalid HTML combinations don't cause magic reparented nodes; only some do. The HTML5 parsing spec (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html) specifies which tag combinations cause strange parsing behavior. I did my best to encode the logic here. It's more lenient than before in some cases, but more strict in others (before we didn't look at the whole stack of tags; now we warn with deeply nested `p` or `form` or `a` tags)."

This reverts an early commit that made it so that elements from two
different owner in the same slot wouldn't share state.

That behavior was helpful, and we did hit a case which was solved by this.
However, this pattern is extremely uncommon. I've yet to even find the
original case, let alone any existing cases in our codebase.

Therefore, we're dropping this to simplify elements and enable new
optimizations."

_mountImageIntoNode moved into ReactMount and wasn't being counted where it was supposed to be. In addition, all DOM elements are now wrapped in a composite wrapper but for the perf tools we want to skip over those or else we'll double-count (at least with the current accounting -- and that's effectively what we did before so this brings us back up to parity).

Fixes #3407.

Test Plan:
Used the jsbin from #3407 and saw similar output from this branch and 0.12:

Summary:
Right now, if a component specifies a propType as, for example,
`myProp: React.PropTypes.shape`, without an actual shape
parameter, any prop type will be accepted, because
`React.PropTypes.shape` returns a function (the actual validator),
not an Error, currently indicating that propType checking passed.

This can create an unfortunate situation where a component looks
like it has fully specified `propTypes`, but in fact does not.

This commit addresses this by warning if a propType checker returns
anything non-falsy that is not an Error (currently all the library
PropTypes return null or an Error).

Test Plan:
Added a unit test; ran `jest` in the root repo directory.
Also ran `grunt lint` and `grunt test`"

Summary:
This section was confusing. I reworded it from:

""JSX is completely optional. You don't have to use JSX with React.
You can create these trees through `React.createElement`. The first
argument is the tag, pass a properties object as the second
argument and children to the third argument.""

to:

""JSX is completely optional; you don't have to use JSX with React.
You can create React elements in plain JavaScript using
`React.createElement`, which takes a tag name or component, a
properties object, and variable number of optional child
arguments.""

and additionally added another child element to the example code.

to handle that AST.

I had hoped to enable parsing of our tests but we can't do that until we

Set state takes a function"
leebyron,2015-01-31 00:42:28,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/279b956c9b54755163fd73af3b898cee91d2a94f,279b956c9b54755163fd73af3b898cee91d2a94f,"Set state takes a function

This diff enables setState to accept a function in addition to a state partial. If you provide a function, it will be called with the up-to-date `state, props, context` as arguments.

This enables some nicer syntax for complex setState patterns:

If setState is doing an increment and wants to guarantee atomicy, you need a function:

```
this.setState(state => ({ number: state.number + 1 }));
```

This atomicy is particularly important if setState is called multiple times in a single frame of execution as the result of complex user actions. It's a tricky bug to chase down and difficult to determine how to fix when you find it. The current pattern of reaching into _pendingState relies on an implementation detail.

In this example: props.doAction() may result in your ancestor re-rendering and providing you with new props. If setState is called directly with an object literal referencing `this.props`, it will use the *old* version of props, not the new value. Using a function solves for this case:

```
this.props.doAction();
this.setState((state, props) => ({ number: state.number * props.multiplier }));
```"

All entry points are for reconciliation are within batching strategies.

Since we don't have any batching strategies with synchronous updates,
there can't be more than one life-cycle method on the stack at any given
time.

Therefore, it's safe to move the composite life cycle flag to a singleton.
This saves us some memory management.

I think that we can get rid of these life cycle states completely in the
future."

Currently, the first setState that happens during initial render will
start a new batch. Any subsequent updates will be batched. That means that
the first setState is synchronous but any subsequent setStates are
asynchronous.

This commit makes it so that the batching starts at the root. That way all
the setStates that happen within life-cycle methods are asynchronous."

I originally did this work so that we could allow setState to be called
before the internal ReactCompositeComponent was constructed. It's unlikely
that we'll go down that route now but this still seems like a better
abstraction. It communicates that this is not immediately updating an
object oriented class. It's just a queue which a minor optimization.
It also avoids bloating the ReactCompositeComponent file.

Since they both depend on the life cycle I break that out into a common
shared dependency. In a follow up I'll refactor the life-cycle management."

Instead of putting the shared code in a base class method, we use a wrapper

That way we ensure that component extensions don't need to implement
ReactComponentMixin and do super() calls into it. This helps to create a
tighter API for custom component extensions.

This provides the first step towards moving these methods to static
methods which allows to use a different dispatch mechanism instead of

helpful community members updating it for us (#2874) when we forget,
it'll just happen naturally the next time the site is generated."

This allows state to be set up in the constructor instead of through
getInitialState. getInitialState is now considered part of ""classic"".
Therefore, they move into ReactClass's constructor.

As a consequence of this, we no longer have a mapping between the internal
representation and the public instance during the mounting process.
Because the constructor hasn't returned yet.

We used to have a special case for calling setState in getInitialState
which was just ignored. This makes that throw and the component is
considered unmounted during the construction phase."

In ReactClass we use early validation to warn you if a accidentally defined
propTypes in the wrong place or if you mispelled componentShouldUpdate.

For plain JS classes there is no early validation process. Therefore, we
wait to do this validation until the component is mounted before we issue
the warning.

This should bring us to warning-parity with ReactClass."

This is the base class that will be used by ES6 classes.

I'm only moving setState and forceUpdate to this base class and the other
functions are disabled for modern classes as we're intending to deprecate
them. The base classes only have getters that warn if accessed. It's as if
they didn't exist.

ReactClass now extends ReactComponentBase but also adds the deprecated
methods. They are not yet fully deprecated on the ReactClass API.

I added some extra tests to composite component which we weren't testing
to avoid regressions.

I also added some test for ES6 classes. These are not testing the new
state initialization process. That's coming in a follow up."

This essentially copies all classic element creation tests to the modern
JSX tests. The classic tests doesn't use JSX and modern tests do.

The idea is that the JSX tests can start dropping dynamic checks once
we have Flow support for those features. JSX won't be necessary for
dropping dynamic checks. Plain object will also work. Flow will also not
be necessary for JSX. However, the tests should test for the suggested
combination (JSX + Flow).

This also moves some misplaced tests to ReactDOM and Validator.

Note that the modern tests uses ES6 classes. I will add separate tests for
those. However, these are not guaranteed to have .displayName so all our
error messages should check .name if available instead. This should be
better abstracted but I just adhoc fix this for now."

This moves ReactClass, ReactElement and ReactPropTypes into a legacy folder
but since it's not quite legacy yet, I call it ""classic"".

These are ""classic"" because they are decoupled and can be replaced by
ES6 classes, JSX and Flow respectively.

This also extracts unit tests from ReactCompositeComponent, which was
terribly overloaded, into the new corresponding test suites.

There is one weird case for ReactContextValidator. This actually happens in
core, and technically belongs to ReactCompositeComponent. I'm not sure
we will be able to statically validate contexts so this might be a case
for dynamic checks even in the future. Leaving the unit tests in classic
until we can figure out what to do with them."

In order to improve support for Chinese and Japanese IME input in
Internet Explorer, use a fallback composition state to determine
inserted text. IE composition events are mostly okay, except for
certain punctuation characters that are ignored. Using the fallback, we
can detect these characters.

The fallback is also useful for emitting `beforeInput` events, so it
makes sense to simply combine these plugins.

This change also incorporates a recent change to the Google Input Tools
browser extension that exposes a `data` field via the `detail` object
on the custom composition events it emits."

ART, just like MultiChild adds an expando property to manage it's diffing
state. This is ugly and bad. We should be moving this state outside the
component for use by the diffing algorithm. This state is not needed by
components nested in composites, and varies by diffing algorithm.

It sucks that I have to add it to every component just to support ART,
but that's the quickest solution, other than disabling preventExtensions.

At least now we know that it sucks."

This separates the reconciliation step of children into a separate module.
This is the first step towards prerendering.

The stateful instances are reconciled and put into a ""rendered children""
set. Updates creates a new of these sets. These two sets are then diffed
to create insert/move/remove operations on the set.

The next step is to move the ReactChildReconciler step to before the
native DOM component. That way it's possible to rely on child
reconciliation without relying on diffing."

Summary:
After #2570, `mountDepth` is only used to enforce that `setProps` and `replaceProps` is only invoked on the top-level component. This replaces `mountDepth` with a simpler `isTopLevel` boolean set by `ReactMount` which reduces the surface area of the internal API and removes the need to thread `mountDepth` throughout React core.

Update Dirty Components in Mount Ordering"
yungsters,2014-11-04 22:25:50,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/c7fd626b1f47d72d9b99fcc065c5ef44da3efcfc,c7fd626b1f47d72d9b99fcc065c5ef44da3efcfc,"Summary:
Currently, `ReactUpdates` updates dirty components in increasing order of mount depth. However, mount depth is only relative to the component passed into `React.render`. This breaks down for components that invoke `React.render` as an implementation detail because the child components will be updated before the parent component.

This fixes the problem by using the order in which components are mounted (instead of their depth). The mount order transcends component trees (rooted at `React.render` calls).

Stop Mutating Merged Lifecycle Results"

Summary:
Currently, `ReactClass` mutates values returned by `getDefaultProps`, `getInitialState`, and `getChildContext`. This is bad because the objects may, for example, be cached and re-used across instances of a React component.

This changes `ReactClass` to instead create a new object. In return for allocating a new object, I've replaced `mapObject` with a `for ... in` so that we are no longer allocating an unused object.

Fair trade, IMO.

The bug was happening because this.state.children was used as a base for
children removal and it wasn't updated until the render, so only the last
removal was actually happening.

Fix involves keeping the updated children state between invocations of
_handleDoneLeaving. After updating this.state and rendering,
updatedState is cleaned up and ready for subsequent array modifications.

ReactClass is now composed by ReactCompositeComponent rather than
inherit from it.

The state transition functions currently use ReactInstanceMap to map an
instance back to an internal representation.

I updated some tests to use public APIs. Other unit tests still reach into
internals but now we can find them using ReactInstanceMap.

I will do more cleanup in follow ups. The purpose of this diff is to
preserve semantics and most of the existing code.

This effectively enables support for ES6 classes. All you would need to
expose is ReactClassMixin."

Fixes #1392.

Previously, ReactComponent.updateComponent set the new props and owner and updated the component's refs. Because it did the actual props assignment, it had to be called by ReactCompositeComponent between componentWillMount and componentDidMount, meaning that it was skipped if shouldComponentUpdate returned false. Now, updateComponent takes the old and new descriptors and only updates refs, allowing a subclass to call updateComponent at a convenient time (specifically, it can be before `this._descriptor` is updated if the subclass also overrides performUpdateIfNecessary).

The new update cycle for composites is:

- receiveComponent is called which stores `this._pendingDescriptor` and calls performUpdateIfNecessary directly or a state update is enqueued, in which case ReactUpdates will call performUpdateIfNecessary
- performUpdateIfNecessary ensures that an update is still pending (which might no longer be the case if an update is queued for a subcomponent that was updated through a parent's reconciliation) and calls updateComponent with the old and new descriptors
- updateComponent calls super to update refs, then calls componentWillReceiveProps (if applicable) and shouldComponentUpdate -- if shouldComponentUpdate returns false, `this._descriptor`, `this.props`, and `this.state` are updated and the update is skipped; else, _performComponentUpdate is called
- _performComponentUpdate calls componentWillUpdate and _updateRenderedComponent, and enqueues the componentDidUpdate call (in that order)
- _updateRenderedComponent calls render and updates the rendered component appropriately

For DOM components (essentially unchanged):

- receiveComponent is called which does a short-circuit check for descriptor equality and delegates to super (which stores `this._pendingDescriptor` and calls performUpdateIfNecessary)
- performUpdateIfNecessary (not overridden) sets new values for `this.props`, etc. and calls updateComponent
- updateComponent does the DOM property and children updates (some synchronously, some queued for the transaction close)

For text and ART components (unchanged):

- receiveComponent updates the DOM or ART directly based on the new props
- updateComponent is never called

Notable changes:

- When shouldComponentUpdate returns false, refs are still updated
- ReactDefaultPerf now includes lifecycle methods in component timings
- updateComponent's signature changed (technically this is part of the public API, though we've never documented it)

This lets you use any kind of iterable as a container of react child elements. It also preserves keys when possible if the iterable is keyed.

 * Use an ES6 Map or Set to hold children.
 * Use an Immutable-js collection to hold children.
 * Use a function* which yields children.

Concretely, this removes the necessary conversion to JS objects if you're mapping over Immutable-js collections to get children, i.e.:

```
<div>
  {myImmutable.map(val => <span>{val}</span>).toJS()
</div>
```

Now we can remove the `toJS()` and the intermediate allocation along with it.

This also cleans up the traverseAllChildrenImpl method."

Edit the description of componentDidMount() to make clear that the function is called only once during the lifecycle of the component, after only the initial render() call. The description is now similar to that for componentWillMount(). The existing wording does not make it clear that the function is called only after the initial render. (Granted, it is possible to infer this from descriptions of the component lifecycle found elsewhere in the documentation, but I think explicit is better than implicit in this case)."

The HTMLtoJSX file is really a part of the React-Magic project, and should belong there rather than here:
 - It doesn't really follow the release cycle of React at all
 - It is totally standalone with no dependency on React
 - The only usage of this script is in React-Magic and on the HTML to JSX page on the React website (http://facebook.github.io/react/html-jsx.html)

I've hotlinked it from the Github site for that project since this was the easiest way to pull it in.

Due to the fact that Github Pages lacks redirects (among other basic web hosting functionality), I've replaced the `html-jsx-lib.js` file with a comment explaining where the file has moved to, just in case anyone was hotlinking it from the React site."

The other big change: this removes the need for the @jsx pragma.
Instead we'll parse everything, assume React is in scope,

runing the transform when @jsx was specified in the docblock).

This moves all logic around legacy descriptors to ReactLegacyDescriptor. This
is responsible for the layer that knows that createClass exports a legacy
factory. When passed one of these classes, it unwraps it to be a real class.

If it is passed a non legacy factory, it is assumed to be a non-react component
that needs to be invoked as a plain function.

The semantic change is that a descriptor is now always returned if passed a
legacy factory. Even if that factory is a mock. A mock would previously return
undefined.

For mocks, I treat the factory as the authoritative function. I call it to extract
the instance or fill it with an empty component placeholder.

Additionally, I make the classes take props as the first argument to the
constructor. This is what the new class system will do.

We currently need to set up some internals by calling the internal construct
method. Instead of doing that automatically in the constructor, I now move that
to a second pass so that mocks can get the plain props.

This means that we can assert that a mock has been called once it's mounted
with it's final props. Instead of the descriptor factory being called."

When I first read these docs, it was not immediately clear to me that I could
use `React.addons.CSSTransitionGroup` to animate a single item coming into view,
or an item replacing an item already there. This was partly due to the example
which rendered a list of items.

This PR adds a blurb about being able to use
`React.addons.CSSTransitionGroup` with one or zero items, provides a code
example, and adds a note blockquote that a `key` attribute must always be
provided on each child of `React.addons.CSSTransitionGroup`. The latter point
was not immediately obvious from the original `TodoList` code example, since it
renders a list which would normally require `key` attributes anyway.

Test Plan:
- Refreshed `http://localhost:4000/react/docs/animation.html`, saw that the
  docs additions rendered correctly.
- Example code not tested (it was extracted from working code)."

Depends on #1758.

Fixes #1698.

Previously, controlled components would update too soon when using something like ReactLayeredComponentMixin (i.e., before the layer's updates could propagate from the parent), causing the cursor to jump even when always updating the new model value to match the DOM state. With this change, we defer the update until after all nested updates have had a chance to finish, which prevents the cursor from misbehaving.

Also cleaned up the logic around updating a bit -- the .value and .checked updates in ReactDOMInput weren't being relied on at all so I removed them and opted for a simple forceUpdate instead. I also got rid of _isChanging which hasn't been necessary since the introduction of update batching.

Test Plan: Tested the example in http://jsfiddle.net/Bobris/ZZtXn/2/ and verified that the cursor didn't jump. Changed the code to filter out numbers and verified that the field prevents typing numbers (attempting to do so still causes the cursor to jump to the end). Also verified that controlled and uncontrolled radio buttons, textareas, and select boxes work."

Breaking changes

- key/ref are no longer accessible on props but they are accessible on the
  descriptors. This means that parents/owners can access it but not the
  component itself.

- Descriptor factories are now plain functions and you can't rely on the
  prototype or constructors of descriptors to identify the component type.

Existing descriptor factories are now wrapped in a legacy factory. Currently it
does nothing but it will give us a hook to track callers to factories that are
not using JSX but just invoking the function directly. It also proxies static
methods/properties to the underlying class. The newer factories don't have this
feature.

ReactTextComponent has it's own little factory because it's props is not an
object. This is a detail and will go away once ReactTextComponent no longer
needs descriptors."

This copies the propType and contextType validation to a wrapper around the
descriptor factory. By doing the validation early, we make it easier to track
down bugs. It also prepares for static type checking which should be done at the
usage site.

This validation is not yet active and is just logged using monitorCodeUse. This
will allow us to clean up callsites which would fail this new type of
validation.

I chose to copy the validation of abstracting it out since this is just an
intermediate step to avoid spamming consoles. This makes more a much cleaner
diff review/history. The original validation in the instance will be deleted as
soon as we can turn on the warnings.

Additionally, getDefaultProps are moved to become a static function which is
only executed once. It should be moved to statics but we don't have a
convenient way to merge mixins in statics right now. Deferring to ES6 classes.

This is still a breaking change since you can return an object or array from
getDefaultProps, which later gets mutated and now the shared instance is
mutated. Mutating an object that is passed into you from props is highly
discouraged and likely to lead to subtle bugs anyway. So I'm not too worried.

The defaultProps will later be resolved in the descriptor factory. This will
enable a perf optimizations where we don't create an unnecessary object
allocation when you use default props. It also means that ReactChildren.map
has access to resolved properties which gives them consistent behavior whether
or not the default prop is specified."

This one was an actual behavioral bug rather than a bug with the tests; our intention was that the first element from the `defaultValue` array would remain selected but IE seemed to be choosing the last one instead. Now we set the value for uncontrolled components in componentDidUpdate when switching from multiple to non-multiple to ensure that a consistent option gets selected.

Test Plan: Ran the ReactDOMSelect tests in jest, phantomjs, IE10, Chrome, and Firefox. Also tested an uncontrolled select manually to make sure that nothing crazy happened when switching between options."

2. click 'x' on the first item. 

This results in two actions being fired: 

1. TODO_CREATE, with an empty string as 'text'

Not removing them resulted in leaks as we would hold on to removed nodes forever.

This really showed up with images and the load event where we would unmount and create a new img with the same react id as the old one. We properly cleared and primed the caches but we would handle the load event for both nodes. We would eventually hit an invariant in that path as we tried to handle the event for the removed node, which no longer matched the node we had in the cache.

This copies the propType and contextType validation to a wrapper around the
descriptor factory. By doing the validation early, we make it easier to track
down bugs. It also prepares for static type checking which should be done at the
usage site.

This validation is not yet active and is just logged using monitorCodeUse. This
will allow us to clean up callsites which would fail this new type of
validation.

I chose to copy the validation instead of abstracting it out to a common abstraction. This is just an
intermediate step to avoid spamming consoles. The original validation in the instance will be deleted as soon as we can turn on the warnings at the callsite. Copy+Delete makes this a more a much cleaner diff review/history.

Additionally, getDefaultProps are moved to become a static function which is
only executed once. It should be moved to statics but we don't have a
convenient way to merge mixins in statics right now. Deferring to ES6 classes.

This is still a breaking change since you can return an object or array from
getDefaultProps, which later gets mutated and now the shared instance is
mutated. Mutating an object that is passed into you from props is highly
discouraged and likely to lead to subtle bugs anyway. So I'm not too worried.

The defaultProps are now resolved in the descriptor factory. This will enable
a perf optimizations where we don't create an unnecessary object allocation
when you use default props. It also means that ReactChildren.map has access to
resolved properties which gives them consistent behavior whether or not the
default prop is specified.

This is a breaking change since it can affect how mapping over children and
transferPropsTo works together with defaultProps."

In IE10/11, it is apparently possible to have a Selection or Range object that has the following properties:

  - `anchorNode` === `focusNode` (Selection) or `startContainer` === `endContainer` (Range)
  - `anchorOffset` === `focusOffset` (Selection) or `startOffset` === `endOffset` (Range)
  - `isCollapsed` === `false` (Selection) or `collapsed` === `false` (Range)

As defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range/ranges.html, this doesn't really make sense. Since the nodes and offsets are the same, the ""collapsed"" value should be `true`.

Moreover, when calling `selection.toString()` in this case, it appears that the entire text contents of `body` -- including `<script>` tag contents -- are considered within the selection. I thought maybe the selected nodes were missing from the DOM or something, but no, they're there.

Sidestep all of this in `ReactDOMSelection` by calculating the `collapsed` property manually and setting the selection length directly to zero if it is actually collapsed.

Side note: I think that for selection restoration on contenteditables, we shouldn't try to do this offset calculation. We should just use the structure provided natively (nodes and offsets) since we can restore using that structure as well."

This uses the return value (an Error or nothing) to indicate whether a prop passes validation or not. It used to be done through calling `console.warn` as a side-effect, except this didn't work well with and `oneOfType`, which calls each validator.

The solution was to insert a `.weak` prop to each validator to suppress the warning message. This is overkill and also doesn't work well in because it increases the potential API surface. Plus, letting the validators warn it can't be easily used for logging, especially for custom validators.

So `.weak` is no longer needed: fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/863.

Backward compatibility for custom validators: since they didn't return anything and directly call `console.warn` or something, this doesn't break them.

Improvements:

  - `arrayOf`, `oneOfType` and `oneOf` got better message now, since they can get hold of their validator's message and output that instead of a generic `warning: bla`.
  - More complete tests, including testing custom types and `isRequired` on everything.

Bug fixes:

  - oneOfType(...).isRequired didn't work. The workaround was to use `oneOfType(a.isRequired, b.isRequired, ...)`. This means `oneOfType(a.isRequired, b)` doesn't make sense. The new version simply makes `oneOfType(...).isRequired` possible.
  - `oneOf([true])` worked for 'true' boolean because it converted everything to string before comparing. It no longer does.
- `oneOf([true]).isRequired` didn't work.

Browsers that natively support the `textInput` event appear to have a bug: when preventing default behavior for a `textInput` event occurring for a spacebar keypress, the character is prevented from being inserted **but the browser scrolls down**.

Minimal repro example: http://jsfiddle.net/salier/bX4fw/

This is ridiculous, since scrolling makes no sense when the user is focused in a textinput or contenteditable. Preventing default at the `textInput` stage should mean to prevent the character from being inserted, and should have no impact at all on scrolling behavior. I have filed this as a Chromium bug (https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=355103) but I'm not going to hold out much hope that they'll fix it.

To resolve this, I'm special-casing the spacebar character at the plugin level, in `BeforeInputEventPlugin`. I looked for ways to do this at the component level, but it seems to me that this is simply a browser bug and it's cleaner to handle it there.

In browsers that can use the native `textInput` event, I'm checking the code of the pressed key. If it's the spacebar, we dispatch the synthetic event as if there were no native `textInput` event -- as if we were running Firefox. Then, if the synthetic event is not canceled and we make it through to the native `textInput` event, bail if the character data is a space character."

This diff introduces `TextInputEventPlugin` and `SyntheticTextInputEvent`, which are based on Webkit's native `textInput` event.

In Chrome, Safari, and Opera, the `textInput` event fires prior to the insertion of character data into the document. For normal typing, for example, thevent sequence is: `keydown`, `keypress`, `textInput`, `input`, `keyup`. The `textInput` event contains a `data` field corresponding to the character data that will actually be inserted.

There is also a `beforeinput` event described by http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-beforeinput, and this is essentially that event, so it may make sense to rename the plugin.

This event is especially useful because it solves a number of issues we can't currently handle with only keypress and composition events:

  - **Windows Chrome: Trailing characters discarded in Korean IME.** For instance, `안녕하세요` becomes `안녕하세` with the final character discarded by the final `compositionend` event. The `textInput` event fires correctly with the final character.
  - **Windows Chrome: Special characters discarded in IME.** Certain ideographs are discarded in IME mode. In Japanese, typing the ideographic space character is not represented by keypress but //is// represented by the subsequent `textInput`. This issue also applies to punctuation characters in Chinese.
  - **OSX Chrome: Characters from palette discarded.** Inserting characters from the OSX character palette fails, since no keypress is fired.

The plugin is useful for Firefox and IE. For these, we record inserted characters via keypress and compositionend events and dispatch the synthetic event with these characters as the `data` field to match the native `textInput` event.

  - Firefox has no corresponding `textInput` event and has not yet implemented `beforeinput`.
  - IE has a native `textinput` event, but it fires after the DOM mutation has already occurred, so it isn't very useful as an analog to the Webkit version. I'm just not going to bother with it."

This way it doesn't end when some random element elsewhere on the page has an ending transition.

It must be noted that this is not a complete fix. If you have multiple transitions on the element, it still ends when the first ends.

I ran into this not working (the transition ends almost immediately, because some unrelated transition ends). This fixes it for me, but I was wondering whether this cornercase was considered, and whether the other cornercase (multiple transitions) was considered.

I think it's very hard to get this correct, and think it might be better to make the timeout explicit, or at least allow to set it explicit, and fall back to this behaviour. But I'm really interested in feedback on this one."

This means that if our `newProps` has keys like `toString`, `valueOf`, or `constructor` etc. set, we will pull these functions off `TransferStrategies` and invoke them when merging props. In most cases this will just result in a failure to merge and some code without side effects being run but in the case of `valueOf` it will actually generate an exception."

The component that gets passed into renderComponent isn't guaranteed to be the
instance that gets mounted. We want to clone the instance.

Unit tests need to reason about the mounted instance. The first code mod changes:

  ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<identifier>)

into

  <identifier> = ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<identifier>)

Using this scripts:

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \
   '^(\s*)ReactTestUtils\.renderIntoDocument\(\s*([$a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\s*\)' \
   '\1\2 = ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument(\2)'

In the second case I do the same for React.renderComponent. However, there are
alot more unnecessary matches so I only codemod if the same identifier occurs
later in the file.

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \
   '^(\s*)React.renderComponent\(\s*([$a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\s*?,(.*?\n?.*?\s\2\b)' \
   '\1\2 = React.renderComponent(\2,\3'

And one more for ReactMount.renderComponent used by internals.

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \
   '^(\s*)ReactMount.renderComponent\(\s*([$a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\s*?,(.*?\n?.*?\s\2\b)' \
   '\1\2 = ReactMount.renderComponent(\2,\3'

This still matches many unnecessary cases where the second occurance of the
identifier is a redeclaration or comment. But this code mod doesn't hurt in
those cases.

Finally I have to do the same for:

  this.<identifier> = React.renderComponent(this.<identifier>,

This is a common pattern for production code but not tests. Some of these call
sites will likely break when we move to true descriptors.

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \

This is the first step towards descriptors. This will start cloning the
component when it's mounted instead of mounting the first instance.

This avoids an issue where a reference to the first instance can hang around
in props. Since a mounted component gets mutated, the descriptor changes.

We don't need to clone the props object itself. Mutating the shallow props
object of a child that's passed into you is already flawed. Those cases need to
use cloneWithProps. A props object is considered shallow frozen after it leaves
the render it was created in."

will fail.

Note that this behavior only manifests itself in tests, because of course
we do not call `dumpCache` in production code.

We could consider storing the `emptyObject` globally to thwart the effects
of `dumpCache`, but it's more idiomatic simply to re-`require` the latest

reverts 23ab30ff873fba816129cafa0c40112dd2ee990d because the issue it fixed doesn't seem to be a problem
anymore. textContent should be better for more things anyway, as the
original 309a88bcf62c1c64a2b91c0eb753c19209a425b2 indicates. It should be faster because innerText
requires layout.

This also allows us to use strings with newlines in our rendered output
and have confidence that they will render the same on subsequent
re-renders. This is especially useful for es6-style backtick multi-line
strings. This will be more consistent as textContent is supported almost
everwhere so we won't have differing behavior between webkit and
firefox.

The key idea here is that you're always rendering `this.state.children`, not
`this.props.children`. When combined with `cloneWithProps()` this means we can
keep them in the DOM as long as we want. We add new children and reactively
update existing ones using `setState()` inside of `componentWillReceiveProps()`
so `this.state.children` always has the latest versions of components. Since we
may be keeping old components around that are no longer in
`this.props.children` we need a way to figure out where they should be inside
of the combined `this.state.children` list.  `ReactTransitionChildMapping` does
this for us.

Based on that infrastructure we can build the interface we always wanted: enter
and leave lifecycle hooks.

When a component is added to the DOM, `componentWillEnter(callback)` gets
called. Call the callback when you're done animating and `componentDidEnter()`
will be called.

When a component is about to be removed from the DOM,
`componentWillLeave(callback)` gets called. Call the callback when you're done
animating and `componentDidLeave()` will be called and the component will
*actually* be removed from the DOM. It won't be removed until you call the
callback.

These also handle ""concurrent"" changes. If you ""stack"" enter/leaves of a single
component before the animation has completed, it will block out all of those
animations until the current animation completes, and then finally it will
animate 0 or 1 times to get itself into the desired current state. This is what
differentiates `componentWillEnter()` from `componentDidMount()`.

The next step would be to build `componentDidReorder()`.

I've built `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` which is identical to the old
`ReactTransitionGroup` and codemodded the callsites."

We've been able to use `querySelectorAll` in all the browsers that we
support for some time now, but we haven't been able to test code that uses
it in the older version of `jsdom` that we were using, until recently.

Besides the general goal of modernizing our code, the impetus for this
specific change is that I'm trying to support testing without having to
render nodes into an actual document. The `.getElementsByName` method is
only defined on `document` and only works if the nodes you care about are
contained by the document.

On the other hand, `querySelectorAll` works on any DOM node, and allows a
more precise selection of just the `<input type=""radio"">` elements that
have the appropriate name.

IE8's implementation of `querySelectorAll` supports attribute-based
selectors, which is all we need here."

When React moved to attaching top-level event listeners on-demand, not all of the dependencies for `ChangeEventPlugin` were set. This led to `onChange` events not firing under certain circumstances. For example, listening to `onChange` on a checkbox will not work because it relies on `onClick` (unless something else on the page was listening to `onClick`)."

`ConvenienceConstructor` is more or less synonymous (for these purposes)
with the wrapper that was previously used:

Pull request #526 updated the behavior of vendor/constants.js without
changing any source files or the bin/jsx-internal script, so files that
should have been rebuilt (like utils/__tests__/ImmutableObject-test.js)
were not automatically rebuilt (unless you knew to do `grunt clean` or
`rm -rf .module-cache` manually).

This commit allows us to bump a version number when we know the transform
toolchain has been altered in a way that will not be visible to
commoner/jsx.

With this convention, if we reset to an older revision (e.g. during a git
bisect) and the appropriate cached module files are still in the
.module-cache/, they can be used without rebuilding. That's why I prefer
this approach to just deleting the .module-cache/.

Closes #104.
Closes #496.
Closes #530."

When events are captured, the nearest React-rendered ancestor is found and events are propagated to its tree. This causes issues when components are nested as only the innermost component receives the events.

This change modifies this behaviour so events propagate all the way up the DOM hierarchy. To reduce the performance cost, this DOM traversal is only done if the component is actually nested (determined by the `containerIsNested` map which is lazily initialised)."
mroch,2013-11-18 18:41:42,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/b91396be8eac3dc57ab1dbd2d3bb27c791d88169,b91396be8eac3dc57ab1dbd2d3bb27c791d88169,"Contexts

Summary:
adds `this.context` which you can think of as implicit props, which are passed automatically down the //ownership// hierarchy.

Contexts should be used sparingly, since they essentially allow components to communicate with descendants (in the ownership sense, not parenthood sense), which is not usually a good idea. You probably would only use contexts in places where you'd normally use a global, but contexts allow you to override them for certain view subtrees which you can't do with globals.

The context starts out `null`:

  var RootComponent = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      // this.context === null
    }
  });

You should **never** mutate the context directly, just like props and state.

You can change the context of your children (the ones you own, not `this.props.children` or via other props) using the new `withContext` method on `React`:

  var RootComponent = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      // this.context === null
      var children = React.withContext({foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}, () => (
        // In ChildComponent#render, this.context === {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}
        <ChildComponent />
      ));
      // this.context === null
    }
  });

Contexts are merged, so a component can override its owner's context **for its children**:

  var ChildComponent = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      // this.context === {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'} (for the caller above)
      var children = React.withContext({foo: 'c'},() => (
        // In GrandchildComponent#render,
        // this.context === {foo: 'c', bar: 'b'}
        <GrandchildComponent />
      ));
      // this.context === {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}
    }
  });"

This renames receiveProps and changes it to take the next component to copy props from instead of just the props. That is,

  component.receiveComponent(nextComponent, transaction)

instead of

  component.receiveProps(nextComponent.props, transaction)

This is a precursor to adding contexts, which will also need to get propagated just like props. This change allows ReactCompositeComponent to override `receiveProps` and do something like

  this._pendingContext = nextComponent.context;"

- No need to mention React, you know you're working with it =).
- Wrap code elements in back ticks, so that they get the ""box"" styling for md.
- You'd want the snippet to work inside the live editor, so you need to `renderComponent`. As per wiki specification, the DOM element on which to mount is `mountNode`, just like on the front page.
- Don't forget the JSX pragma, or else your `render` fails.
- Nitpick: empty line after the end of md.
- No need for jQuery reference since
  1. The general mood around React is that you don't need jQuery.
  2. The syntax' still clear without jQuery.
  3. We're doing a jQuery integration entry =).
- `getInitialState` was absent.
- You don't need `componentWillMount` here. fetch them in `getInitialState`.
- The non-spoken convention seems to call the event handler `""handle"" + eventName`. So `handleResize` clearly indicates it's a `resize` handler while `updateDimensions` might do something else. This latter name might actually be better under circumstances where you use call the method directly somewhere, but since we removed the only direct usage in `componentWillMount` this is fine.
- Went OCD again and tried to keep the code short. `width` is enough of a demo. Removed `height`.
- Distinguish between DOM events and React events. Wish we go full React events in a near future."

Currently, default props as defined by `getDefaultProps` are only used if a prop is not specified (using `X in Y` check).

However, this makes it difficult for composing components to pass along the state of not being defined, for example:

  render: function() {
    // If `this.props.someProp` is not set, `InnerThing` should use the default value.
    return <InnerThing someProp={this.props.someProp} />;
  }

This changes the requirement for falling back to the default value to an undefined check (using `typeof X === 'undefined'`)."

anway.

This introduces `ReactLink` which is a super lightweight way to do two-way binding for React.

If you want to use a controlled form input today, it's a lot of lines of code:

http://jsfiddle.net/T3z3v/

Look how many times `name` is repeated in there. And you have to remember to wire up event handles and pass the right state and
right event handler for *each* form field. It's really annoying.

With ReactLink, you can ""link"" a form value to a state field. It's just some simple sugar around the value prop/onChange
convention:

https://gist.github.com/petehunt/6689857

Ah, much nicer! And requires very little core changes or extra bytes. `ReactLink` just wraps the current value and ""request
change"" handler into a little object and provides some sugar to create some from composite component state."

boundary markers.  The new strategy (of tagging the first node with a
special attribute) has a similar virtue, since the parser should preserve
that attribute only for the nodes we care about, and any rendered nodes

- Use todomvc-common base.css. The old one had to change ids to
classes. No longer necessary.
- Give `cx` a better name and move it in `Utils`.

- Remove todo if the new edited value is empty.

This introduces <ReactTransitionGroup>, a component that works a lot
like Angular's ng-animate.

The problem we're currently facing is twofold:
1. We don't really have a great convention surrounding CSS transitions
   in React
2. (harder) we can't animate nodes that are leaving the DOM, as their
   nodes are instantly destroyed.

To solve the first issue I've adopted Angular's convention. It's
implemented in ReactTransitionableChild.

The second part is what's tricky. To do this I've implemented three modules:
- ReactTransitionableChild, which can keep its old children around if they
  change to null
- ReactTransitionKeySet, which can look at a prev and next set of child
  keys and merge them in a reasonable way
- ReactTransitionGroup, which combines ReactTransitionableChild and
  ReactTransitionKeySet to keep nodes that are leaving the DOM in the
  DOM until their animations are complete"

This fixes a reconciliation bug introduced by adffa9b0f4128ca4832ddd03fdeca2c9fe434689.

The new unit test case exhibits the bug. When a component that has rendered child components is updated to render inline text, we usually:

 # Unmount and remove all child components.
 # Set the new inline text content.

However, with batched child operations, we do not **remove all child components** until later. The current implementation will set the inline text content and blow away those nodes, causing a fatal when `ReactMultiChild` later tries to find and remove those nodes.

This fixes the bug by ensuring that text content changes are also enqueued."

The original tests were flawed because the `Danger` module exploits the fact that all React-generated markup has at least one attribute. This allows the module to extract node names from markup strings faster.

However, the tests were passing in strings of markup with no attributes.

Also, this fixes a test failure due to the test trying to set text content into a `<tr>` which is typically disallowed by browsers (and PhantomJS). This changes it to use `<td>` instead."

Setting `innerHTML` is slow: http://jsperf.com/react-child-creation/2

This reduces the number of times we set `innerHTML` by batching markup generation in a component tree.

As usual, I cleaned up the `ReactMultiChild` module significantly.

== Children Reconciliation ==

When a `ReactNativeComponent` reconciles, it compares currently rendered children, `prevChildren`, with the new children, `nextChildren`. It figures out the shortest series of updates required to render `nextChildren` where each update is one of:

 - Create nodes for a new child and insert it at an index.
 - Update an existing node and, if necessary, move it to an index.
 - Remove an existing node.

This serializable series of updates is sent to `ReactDOMIDOperations` where the actions are actually acted on.

== Problem ==

There are two problems:

 # When a `ReactNativeComponent` renders new children, it sets `innerHTML` once for each contiguous set of children.
 # Each `ReactNativeComponent` renders its children in isolation, so two components that both render new children will do so separately.

For example, consider the following update:

  React.renderComponent(<div><p><span /></p><p><span /></p></div>, ...);
  React.renderComponent(<div><p><img /><span /><img /></p><p><img /><span /><img /></p></div>, ...);

This will trigger setting `innerHTML` four times.

== Solution ==

Instead of enqueuing the series of updates per component, this diff changes `ReactMultiChild` to enqueue updates per component tree (which works by counting recursive calls to `updateChildren`). Once all updates in the tree are accounted for, we render all markup using a single `innerHTML` set."

As @leebyron and balpert pointed out, if the markup on the server is differnet than what the client expects undefined behavior and chaos may ensue. A good fallback
is for us to just inject the client-side markup (as it is the source of truth) and warn the user in __DEV__ that something is wrong. In order to do a fast
browser-independent check of the DOM I use an adler32 checksum of the generated markup. I believe this is better than a simple innerHTML compare because different
browsers massage innerHTML differently."

This fixes two bugs related to string-casting in React:

 # Setting `<input value={0} />` would use an empty `value` because `0` is falsey.
 # Using `onChange` and `setState` with non-strings could lead to an infinite loop.

The latter is possible with controlled inputs when:

 - User changes input value.
 - `onpropertychange` fires.
 - `ChangeEventPlugin` dispatches `onChange`.
 - A handler responds via `this.setState` with a non-string value (e.g. a number).
 - The input re-renders and re-sets `value`.
 - The new `value` is not a string, but the current `value` (read from the element) is cast to a string automatically by the browser.
 - This triggers another `onpropertychange`.
 - `ChangeEventPlugin` dispatches another `onChange`.

There are other changes I'm sure but the most important is that module
sorting results in deterministic builds.

The biggest win here comes for releases. Previously we had to jump
through hoops to make sure the files we put in bower were the same files
we put on the CDN, were the same files packaged in the Ruby gem, were
the same files we packaged into a zip file, were the same file we used
when create PRs to CDNJS. Rebuilding docs also resulted in conflicting
versions so we had to be careful when committing. This takes away all of
that pain. We can build from the same revision and get the same files."

not the most efficient approach but I wanted to keep this inital diff
simple. It also ignores empty values for backwards compatibility.

A dynamic value can be provided as a key to a child. Either as part of an object

We have to be careful to escape this key before inserting it into the DOM since
it could become a vulnerability. We fixed this by escaping just the keys.

However, the current implementation breaks when you used escaped keys. The
internal value is escaped and the value used by getAttributeNode and
getElementById are both unescaped.

This fixes that by keeping the unescaped value internally but escaping it right
before the HTML is generated (like any other attribute).

This is important since business logic IDs (that should be used as keys)
contains characters that need to be escaped."

A node is considered valid if it

  1. has the expected ID (more of a sanity check than something that is
     ever likely to go wrong), and

  2. is contained by a currently mounted container.

When these requirements are met, we can be confident that
`ReactMount.findReactRenderedDOMNodeSlow(node.id) === node`, which is
important for cache consistency because `findReactRenderedDOMNodeSlow` is
what we fall back to when we don't find a node in the cache.

Point 2 is a subtle requirement, because it allows nodes to be valid even
if they are not currently contained by a document. Rendering into a
detached node is okay, in other words (which is something that
`document.getElementById` never properly accounted for).

Containment testing takes linear time in the depth of the DOM, which
sounds unfortunate until you realize that virtually all browsers support a
native `ancestor.contains(descendant)` method, and in practice the vast
majority of nodes are either orphaned with `.parentNode === null` or not
very deep relative to their container."

This patch avoids priming up front in favor of making the most of the work
done by `ReactMount.findReactRenderedDOMNodeSlow`, which calls
`ReactID.getID` while traversing the rendered DOM. The insight is this: if
`getID` simply primes the cache whenever it finds a new ID, then
`findReactRenderedDOMNodeSlow` will end up priming quite a few more nodes

This behavior seemed incorrect for composite components.

- isComponentMounted() represents ReactComponent's lifecycle of mounting
- isMounted() represents ReactCompositeComponent's lifecycle of isMounted()

Therefore, ReactComponents no longer have isMounted(). I think this is fine since it was not supposed to be public anyway."

Summary:
This is a proposal based loosely on the discussions I've had with @paulshen and @jwalke. It implements a shim for `React.DOM.input` (used as `<input>`) that supports two different use cases depending on whether `value` is provided or not.

If a `value` is //not// provided, the input will be initialized with the empty string (or `defaultValue`) and anytime the user changes the input, the `onChange` (or `onTextChange`) handler will be fired and the DOM will reflect the new changes.

  React.renderComponent(
    <input type=""text"" defaultValue=""Untitled"" onTextChange={handleChange} />,
    container
  );

If a `value` is provided, the input will be initialized to that value. Anytime the user changes the input, the `onChange` (or `onTextChange`) handler will be fired. However, the DOM will //not// reflect the new changes. If a `value` is provided, it is the responsibility of the owner to update the `value` prop passed in.

  var value = ""Untitled"";
  var input = React.renderComponent(
    <input type=""text"" value={value} onTextChange={handleChange} />,
    container
  );
  function handleChange(event) {
    // Do something cool like strip out non-numbers.
    var value = event.target.value.replace(/\D/g, '');
    input.setProps({value: value});
  }

This is just a start and we should build similar components for `textarea` and `select`. Also, this does not inject the new components because the changes are not backward compatible. Once we change all `<input>` uses to use `ReactDOMInput`, then we can inject."

This fixes the last known parts of the flattening experiment. This has grown to
be somewhat complex and potentially fragile because of it. We may end up
reverting flattening in the future or address it slightly differently.

The purpose of this diff is to test if we've finally understood the real world
edge cases that flattening can lead to and how we have to key components to
cover those cases.

With this commit we never rekey the internal _key property. The semantics is
that once a component passes through a composite component, it's identity is
frozen.

props.key should accept numeric values and booleans which includes 0 and false.
This fixes the truthiness check.

We should never warn about missing key properties if a component is passed as a
static child. The _key acts as a flag to determine whether this component
was checked already."

IE8 doesn't support oninput and IE9 supports it badly but we can do
almost a perfect shim by listening to a handful of different events
(focus, blur, propertychange, selectionchange, keyup, keydown).

This always triggers event handlers during the browser's event loop (not
later in a setTimeout) and after the value property has been updated.

The only case I know of where this doesn't fire the event immediately is
if (in IE8) you modify the input value using JS and then the user does a
key repeat, in which case we fire the event on the second keydown.

Test Plan:
Modify ballmer-peak example to add es5-shim and to use onTextChange
instead of onInput. In IE8, IE9, and latest Chrome, make sure that the
event is fired upon:

* typing normally,
* backspacing,
* forward-deleting,
* cutting,
* pasting,
* context-menu deleting,
* dragging text to reorder characters.

After modifying the example to change .value, make sure that the event
is not fired as a result of the changes from JS (even when the input box
is focused)."

 # Provide a cross-browser implementation that conforms to the DOM Level 3 Events API so people don't have to use `nativeEvent`.
 # Generalize the event object API so that it can be shared by `DOMEventManager`, a top-level event delegation WIP.

Also, since `wheel` is the standard event name, let's use that in React.

  React.renderComponent(React.DOM.div({
    style: {

Summary:
This makes a few changes to React Core, most notably `ReactEventEmitter` and `ReactEventTopLevelCallback`.

 - Changed `ReactEventEmitter` to use `EventListener` (instead of `NormalizedEventListener`).
 - Deleted `NormalizedEventListener` (which was previously broken).
 - Created `getEventTarget` which is used to get a normalized `target` from a native event.
 - Changed `ReactEventTopLevelCallback` to use `getEventTarget`.
 - Renamed `abstractEventType` to `reactEventType` in `AbstractEvent`.
 - Reanmed `abstractTargetID` to `reactTargetID` in `AbstractEvent`.
 - Removed `originatingTopLevelEventType` from `AbstractEvent` (unused and violates encapsulation).
 - Removed `nativeEvent.target === window` check when refreshing authoritative scroll values (unnecessary).

This actually fixes React because `NormalizedEventListener` does not currently do what it promises to do (which is normalizing `target` on the native event). The `target` event is read-only on native events.

This also revises documentation and adds `@typechecks` to a few modules.

NOTE: Most importantly, this sets the stage for replacing `AbstractEvent` with `ReactEvent` and subclasses, piecemeal."

Currently we're mutating _key. Mutation here is fine, but it needs to
be idempotent - which it's not. This is causing some issues.

Instead I reassign the _key every time it passes through a flattening.
This means that it's unique and stable for a single pass through a composite
component. When it's repassed another level, it loses it previous
identity and is rekeyed by it's new location.

For auto-generated keys by index, this actually means it has the same
semantics as before flattening.

For explicit keys, it has the effect that keys need to be unique at
every level. Regardless of how the key got there. Every component needs to ensure
that it doesn't combine keys from two different sources that may collide. This
is also inline with the old semantics but less intuitive in the new model."

This expects static children as additional arguments to the constructor
and flattens any array arguments one level deep.

Component(props, child1, child2, arrayOfChildren, child3) ->
.props.children = [child1, child2, ...arrayOfChildren, child3]

This can avoid an additional heap allocation for the unflat array.

It allows you to pass nested arrays and objects like you used to. Those
aren't immediately flattened. That makes this a fairly safe change.

Passing a dynamic array without key properties will yield a warning
(once). Might consider throwing later.

Once we change the transpiler to use the new syntax, you'll end up with
a single flat array in normal usage.

This doesn't actually update the JSX transform."

Ship CJS modules instead of browserified build"
zpao,2013-05-31 17:57:40,https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/0c6bbf275bb14a0b37426a5caf3dfd31753d36f3,0c6bbf275bb14a0b37426a5caf3dfd31753d36f3,"Ship CJS modules instead of browserified build

It turns out that if you try to browserify a file requiring react-tools,
it doesn't work. This is because browserify just visits the require
statements in the file and looks for files in that path.
./ReactCompositeComponent doesn't exist and that's the point that fails.
So the fix is to actually ship each of our CJS modules as individual
files like browserify expects. This should have no negative side effects
- we still only export React (though the rest of our modules are now
actually accessible, which might make it easier to do more with the
module).

The other change here is to move source-map to dependencies since it's
required in the transform code.

Test Plan:

```
$ npm pack .
$ cd /tmp
$ npm install path/to/react-tools-0.3.1.tgz
$ echo ""require('react-tools')"" > test.js
$ browserify test.js
```"
