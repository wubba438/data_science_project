Go 1.12 has changed syscall on Darwin to start using libSystem for
forward-compatibility. That means we need to add support for more
signals to be able to run all supported tests and examples on macOS.

Many of the mappings from libc_aaa_trampoline to SYS_AAA were based on
https://github.com/golang/go/commit/a3b01440fef3d2833909f6651455924a1c86d192.

Improve error when an unsupported signal is called,
by making the signal name visible in the error message.

GopherJS 1.12 is out by now, so it's safe to remove this code that

Do so by moving the actively used code from reflect_go1111.go back
into reflect.go as it was before PR #865, and delete reflect_go111.go.

Go 1.11.1 has been released recently. It includes some changes to the
reflect package, including:

-	golang/go@a2f1c8e2ad723589eed8f01056e29f6156869e53
-	golang/go@3afa9dfa9b00c17c8ad0e42b220ec37329631f2c
-	golang/go@58c9bd9bfbedda966d2ae687f3e23f67ec889bc4

The second commit makes some changes to internal reflect code that
makes GopherJS reflect overrides no longer compatible, causing the
package to no longer build:

	$ gopherjs build reflect
	/usr/local/go/src/reflect/value.go:673:60: cannot use t (variable of type *rtype) as *funcType value in argument to funcLayout
	/usr/local/go/src/reflect/value.go:336:21: cannot use methodReceiver(op, v, int(v.flag) >> flagMethodShift) (value of type *rtype) as *funcType value in assignment

Specifically, the type of return value t of function methodReceiver
was changed from *rtype to *funcType in commit golang/go@3afa9dfa9b00c17c8ad0e42b220ec37329631f2c.

This change updates the native reflect override for methodReceiver
function and Value.call method accordingly.

Maintain backwards compatibility with Go 1.11(.0) by creating
a custom go1.11.1 release tag (to be applied whenever Go version
is 1.11.1 or greater) and using it to select the appropriate overrides
for the reflect package for Go 1.11.1 and Go 1.11(.0).

This way, GopherJS 1.11-2 will function with Go 1.11.1 and Go 1.11(.0)
versions, rather than only with Go 1.11.1.

Regenerate natives with:

	go generate ./compiler/natives

Use Go 1.11.1 in CI.

Bump GopherJS version to GopherJS 1.11-2.

The Go stdlib overrides (i.e., compiler/natives package) are already
embedded into the GopherJS build system. This makes it possible for the
gopherjs binary to access them even if the gopherjs repository is not
present in GOPATH (e.g., because it was deleted, or because it's
vendored).

Doing that for natives but not the js, nosync packages makes little
sense, since the gopherjs repository still needs to exist in GOPATH.

This change fixes that. By embedding the core GopherJS packages
analogously to natives, the gopherjs binary becomes more standalone.
Now, it only requires GOROOT/src to contain the matching version of Go
source code.

Non-core GopherJS packages are not embedded (e.g., the GopherJS
compiler itself). That means it needs to exist in GOPATH to be
buildable (otherwise, the user gets a ""cannot find package"" error).
This is expected just like with any other normal Go package.

I don't see a good reason to skip string internalization in reflect
package. It was introduced as part of other changes for Go 1.7 support
in commit f1514b43cee84578a6bc0e88c8be912e03b400c8, but no rationale
was provided.

Skipping internalization is inconsistent and causes issues because
string comparison no longer works as expected.

Specifically, the test TestMethodByNameUnExportedFirst was failing with:

	got , expected ΦExported

The reason it was failing is because the test makes a
typ.MethodByName(""ΦExported"") call. Once that string is internalized,
it becomes ""\xCE\xA6Exported"".

As a result, the code in rtype.MethodByName was failing to find the
method by name, because the internalized and non-internalized strings
did not match:

	have: unexported want: Î¦Exported match: false
	have: ΦExported want: Î¦Exported match: false

Removing this special behavior seems to not have any adverse effects,
fixes the issue and makes things simpler:

	have: unexported want: Î¦Exported match: false
	have: Î¦Exported want: Î¦Exported match: true"

When building a package that lies outside of a GOPATH, its import path

directory where the package is located.

Do so even for packages that are inside a GOPATH workspace. It should
produce identical results. As of right now, there are no known cases

fall back to using base of import path as long as

The $ptr variable in every output function appears never to be used,
so this eliminates it. It's an obsolete hold-over from a previous change.

It appears it was added in df432fe6, where it was referenced in
compiler/expressions.go, but then a few days later with 923aee9f21965,
that reference was removed, but the original declaration was left behind.

By not adding $ptr to the c.localVars list, it is neither set nor read.
It is not used anywhere else.

Background

I noticed while playing with `uglifyjs`, a ton of warnings such as:

	WARN: Dropping unused variable $ptr [main.js:95,666198]
	WARN: Dropping unused variable $ptr [main.js:95,667947]

Which piqued my curiosity, to see if GopherJS could possibly be made
intelligent enough to eliminate this $ptr value from the output when
it's not used.

Looking at the output of one of my compiled projects, I saw many
examples such as:

	Object.ptr.prototype.Get = function(key) {
		var $ptr, key, o;
		o = this;
		return o.object[$externalize(key, $String)];
	};

Some grepping further revealed that the only time we ever set the
variable is in lines such as:

	/* */ } return; } if ($f === undefined) { $f = { $blk: Cond.ptr.prototype.Wait }; } $f.$ptr = $ptr; $f._r = _r; $f.c = c; $f.$s = $s; $f.$r = $r; return $f;

Which is just restoring the function state after returning from a
possibly-blocking function call.

I found no other use of this variable, so I removed it, and re-compiled
my project, both with and without the -m flag, and got the following
size reductions:

| Build command     | Original bytes | After bytes  | Savings (%)     |
|-------------------|---------------:|-------------:|----------------:|
| gopherjs build    | 11,743,976     | 11,608,077   | 135,899 (1.16%) |

Use the gcimporter15 package instead. It supports a more modern binary

The gcimporter15 package is marked as deprecated and said to be deleted
in October 2017. However, the replacement package does not expose the
functionality suitable for GopherJS current needs. That means we'll
need to find a resolution by the time it's deleted. It will either be a
feature request to add the needed functionality, a rewrite of GopherJS
code to use available functionality, or vendoring/copying the code.

This changes fixes GopherJS ability to build os/user package. In turn,
this change also fixes crypto/x509 and net/http on darwin. The goal is
to ensure that os/user builds without errors, because it may end up
being imported by some stdlib packages (e.g., crypto/x509 on darwin
in Go 1.9).

This is accomplished by disabling cgo for these standard library
packages. Normally, GopherJS build context enables cgo for the purpose
of catching when a user package uses cgo and reporting that:

	CgoEnabled: true, // detect `import ""C""` to throw proper error
	...
	if len(pkg.CgoFiles) > 0 {
		return nil, &ImportCError{path}
	}

But we don't want to use cgo for standard library packages. They have
support for building without cgo by using !cgo build constraints, which
we want to activate. Setting bctxt.CgoEnabled to false achieves that.

Add to CI a test of os/user package for gopherjs, as well as ensure
net/http builds successfully. We can't run its tests because there
are too many and they require the HTTP server, but only client is
implemented in GopherJS.

Skip new Go 1.9 Linux-only test TestEnvVars that depends on system

not supported on Windows either:

	func SystemCertPool() (*CertPool, error) {

			// Issue 16736, 18609:
			return nil, errors.New(""crypto/x509: system root pool is not available on Windows"")

Return non-nil error in loadSystemRoots so that x509.SystemCertPool
correctly reports a failure. As a result, need to skip
TestSystemCertPool now too.

There's no need to override execSecurityRoots, because nothing needs or
calls it (the things that do are overridden or skipped)."

This is a new type in Go 1.9.

Map is a concurrent map. It's supposed to be safe for multiple
goroutines to call a Map's methods concurrently.

For now, implement it as a simple wrapper around map[interface{}]interface{}.
Since GopherJS is not multithreaded, as long as context switches don't
happen within Map methods, this should be safe.

TODO: Verify this is actually safe/correct.

gopherjs test uses tempFile to create temporary files during execution
of examples. tempFile calls os.OpenFile to create a file. os.OpenFile
calls newFile, which in Go 1.9 tries to add the file to the runtime
poller.

Normally, on OSes like darwin, linux, etc., this tries to use a real
runtime poller from internal/poll package. We override that package
so that a no-op implementation (based on NaCL implementation) is used
instead.

intermediate solution of try to figure out working directory inside
Import, but continue to use empty string on failure (such as if in
GOARCH=js mode, e.g., inside browser).

resolve relative import paths, such as ""."" or ""./foo/bar"".

I noticed that the code that does string internalization/externalization
uses a regexp to detect if the string consists of ASCII characters only,
in order to shortcut the conversion process.

Regexps are a general tool that optimizes for brevity, not performance.
When inside a hot loops, it's often possible to write faster
code rather than using a regexp.

I modified the prelude code as follows to gather some timing information:

	var regexpTaken = 0;

	setInterval(function() {
	  console.log(""regexpTaken: "" + regexpTaken + "" ms"");
	}, 3000);

	var t0 = performance.now();
	var x = $isASCII(v);
	var t1 = performance.now();
	regexpTaken += t1 - t0;

I found that for most programs, the process of string internalization
and externalization does not occur very often. The total time spent doing
the regexp matching, as reported by regexpTaken, was in the order of
1-10 milliseconds.

However, one of the workloads I've tested, which heavily uses encoding/binary
package to decode a binary data file, ended up performing the
string internalization/externalization process as much as 2372654 times.
At that point, regexpTaken reported around 1 second of time doing regexp
matches. I thought it would be worthwhile to see if it can be optimized.

I compared three implementations of $isASCII:

	// $isASCII reports whether string s contains only ASCII characters.
	var $isASCII = function(s) {
	  // The original code that uses a regexp search.
	  return s.search(/^[\x00-\x7F]*$/) !== -1;
	};

	// $isASCII reports whether string s contains only ASCII characters.
	var $isASCII = function(s) {
	  // Can use test to directly report if there is or isn't a match,
	  // since the index returned by search isn't really used.
	  //
	  // Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test.
	  return /^[\x00-\x7F]*$/.test(s);
	};

	// $isASCII reports whether string s contains only ASCII characters.
	var $isASCII = function(s) {
	  // Use a simple for loop instead of regexp.
	  for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
	    if (s.charCodeAt(i) >= 128) {
	      return false;
	    }
	  }
	  return true;
	};

Benchmark Summary

I've done 3 runs in each browser, clearing cache before each run.
I used latest nightly versions of each browser. This is the summary:

|               | Chrome    | Safari   | Firefox   |
|---------------|----------:|---------:|----------:|
| regexp search | 1565.4 ms | 888.4 ms | 1589.3 ms |
| regexp test   | 1378.1 ms | 823.4 ms |  550.1 ms |
| for loop      | 1145.6 ms | 507.4 ms |  326.5 ms |

Using a simple for loop is significantly faster in all browsers
tested. The code is also readable.

Previously, many of the flags were global, instead of local to each
command. As a result, it was possible to set flags that are unsupported
for a given command.

This change makes all flags local, and only adds flags that are
actually supported by each command.

This improves the output of gopherjs --help and gopherjs <command>
--help, because it more accurately maps to the reality of flags and how
they're used. This way, flags that are unused by a certain command do
not show up in that command's --help output.

It's no longer possible to set -w flag with gopherjs serve, which was
meaningless (it had no effect, and was confusing).

The -w flag is also removed from gopherjs get command. It's unlikely
anyone is using -w flag together with gopherjs get command on purpose,
since it's pretty loaded and confusing. Instead, people can use
gopherjs get, followed by gopherjs install -w to achieve same effect.

This reverts commit 62bca28b2835514b22712edb8104a624030a08c0.

We've originally discussed two possible fixes in issue #594:

> The gopherjs tool does not use the GOARCH environment variable
> in any way. Internally, GopherJS always uses js as GOARCH value
> when compiling user code, but it does other internal stuff when
> compiling standard library.
>
> 1. One fix is to make the gopherjs tool really ignore GOARCH env
> var. In other words, setting it to any value should have no effect;
> it shouldn't cause this failure.
>
> 2. We could also consider making it use the value of GOARCH, and
> error out if it's set to anything other than js (which is the
> default and the only supported value). Since gopherjs can't compile
> for any other architectures.

Upon further consideration, after seeing issue #601 and gopherjs/gopherjs.github.io#66,
we've decided (see discussion in https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs.github.io/pull/66#issuecomment-286519322)
to revisit this issue and change gopherjs to completely ignore GOARCH
environment variable, instead of requiring it to be unset or equal to js.

Closes #601.
Updates #594."

This change works around the issues discussed in #529 by using a
temporary file for capturing the stdout of a runnable example,
rather than os.Pipe. This allows examples to work in cases
where they would previously stall.

ioutil.ReadFile and its supporting functions are copied from
ioutil into testing, in order to avoid having ""testing"" package
import extra packages that the real ""testing"" package does not.

gopherjs tool testFuncs.load does not take into account the overridden
natives, see https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/blob/b9bcb1da229a59cc1e1d168401662cb6450aae08/tool.go#L827.
So we still need to print the expected output for the example to pass.

Given there are only 2 disabled examples, it's easier to just do this
in short term. But it might be good to eventually improve code for
overriding natives so that examples are properly overridden as well.

Regenerate compiler/natives."

While sending an empty body is probably compliant with the spec, it's
unnecessary, and it causes at least one known implementation (the nodejs

Discarding entity body for GET requests
Discarding entity body for HEAD requests

while working on #595, and some others I just did on the fly when

Changes done include:

- Move sprintError under printError.
- Simplify handleError signature to accept error value.
- Use simpler, more readable and consistent control flow.
- Execute closure first, handle error after.
- Use err instead of exit code.
- Replace 'bytes.NewBuffer(nil) -> new(bytes.Buffer)'.
- Remove closure for gopherjs doc command.
- Simplify (some) opportunities found with gosimple:

	tool.go:517:59: should use time.Since instead of time.Now().Sub (S1012)
	third_party/importer/export.go:431:5: should use strings.ContainsAny(format, ""{}\n"") instead (S1003)

By now, the crc32 package makes use of functions implemented
in architecture-specific files. GopherJS ends up taking on the
generic ""other architectures"" configuration that works when
there isn't an architecture-specific CRC32-IEEE algorithm,
nor an architecture-specific CRC32-C algorithm.

In the future, it's possible hash/crc32 performance can be improved
by doing something architecture-specific, but this will do for now.

Fixes the following build issue for hash/crc32 package:

Previously, it was not possible to call stream.cancel and block until a

blocking func calls from being deferred.

That bug has since been resolved in 50101461d59f26b13c876f57aab314ce55387671,
so it's possible to do that now.

However, I found no compelling reason to do so at this time. I prefer
not to implement this without a concrete reason and a way of testing
that it works correctly, so simply update the comment and remove
commented out code.

This makes the behavior of http.DefaultTransport using Fetch API more
similar as when using XHR API.

It's unfortunate to have to do this, since it's kinda magic, but this
seems to be the most reasonable default. It's consistent with the
previous behavior of XHR implementation.

There is no equivalent property in http.Request as far as I can tell.
The only other way to set credentials would be to use req.AddCookie,
but then one would need to get the cookie in JavaScript, which is not
possible if that cookie has HttpOnly flag set.

It appears this is an unfortunate reality that we have to deal with to
provide a useful http.DefaultTransport implementation on frontend,
because of restrictions put into place due to security concerns on the web.

For reference, see:

https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-credentials-mode
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/credentials

> A request has an associated credentials mode, which is ""omit"",
> ""same-origin"", or ""include"". Unless stated otherwise, it is ""omit"".

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials

> Setting withCredentials has no effect on same-site requests.

So default XHR behavior without withCredentials set is like Fetch
with ""same-origin"" credentials mode.

The motivation to use Fetch API is because it's lower level, and allows
implementing an http.RoundTripper more efficiently (less conversions
between strings and []byte). It also supports streaming body responses
efficiently.

req.Cancel is partially supported; it gets RoundTrip to return right away,
but may not cancel the underlying request that the browser will make. It
is still on the roadmap for Fetch API to add support for canceling requests,
once done, this can be improved. CancelRequest(*http.Request) is not implemented
because that method is deprecated.

Dynamically determine which of Fetch, XMLHttpRequest APIs are available and
gracefully fallback to the best available API, if any.

Tested in stable channel of Chrome, latest Safari, Firefox (developer
edition). Only stable Chrome appears to support Fetch API with streaming
response bodies at time of testing (Firefox supports Fetch API but not yet
streaming response bodies), but all modern browsers have WIP implementations
at HEAD, so it's only a matter of time before they (seamlessly) benefit from
this patch.

Specifically, we now borrow Go's testFuncs.load(), isTestMain, and isTest

In terms of functionality, this means that we:

- We require the first character after the 'Test' prefix to be capital. e.g.
  don't treat TesticularCancer() as a test.
- We don't treat TestMain(t *testing.T) as TestMain(m *testing.M)

When writing Go code that is something more than just a very short
snippet, it helps to organize code as a Go package. It may contain 1 or
more .go files in a directory.

`go build` is primarily used with Go packages, as in `go build
import/path`. We should suggest the same use of `gopherjs build`. That
will make it easier for users to get started and grow their code,
because they'll be able to split into multiple .go files without having
to update their build step.

It's still useful to be able to use build command with ad-hoc packages
specified with a list of .go files, so continue to mention that mode.
Both go and gopherjs tools support it, and it might be more common and
useful with GopherJS."

go/types defines some types just like golang.org/x/tools/go/types, but
because they have different import paths, those types are not
interchangeable.

Not all packages have moved into Go standard library. Namely,
golang.org/x/tools/go/importer and golang.org/x/tools/go/types/typeutil
are still living in x/tools subrepo.

While golang.org/x/tools/go/types/typeutil has been updated
to import go/types in https://golang.org/cl/18207, it appears
golang.org/x/tools/go/importer has not yet been updated in a similar way.
So if we import it as is, we would have incompatible types defined
in go/types and golang.org/x/tools/go/types.

A temporary solution to have a working codebase is to vendor that
package and modify it to import go/types.

This can be undone as soon as the upstream package is modified to
import go/types itself.

I've asked about its status in the aforementioned CL, awaiting a
reply in order to figure out the best plan forward."

Add a modified version of go/test/run.go for GopherJS. The run.go file
should be run via native Go, but it will itself invoke `gopherjs run`
for running tests. All modifications are marked with a ""// GOPHERJS""
comment.

At this time, only a limited subset of folders and test types is
supported. More can be added.

Within the tests that are run, there are currently 234 tests passing
and 34 failing. The failing test are marked as known failures and do
not trigger CI failure.

As the bugs are resolved, the knownFails map in run.go should be
updated to remove resolved failures. The test will currently fail if
any of the tests that were expected to fail unexpectedly pass (if it's
not an accident, then knownFails map should be updated accordingly). I
hope this will not cause too much noise; it can be changed if so.

Four of the tests are compiler panics, they should probably be fixed
first. The remaining ones are briefly described but not triaged further
than that.

The run.go test runner can be run manually via:

	go run run.go -v -summary

Or to include known fails full error messages:

	go run run.go -v -summary -show_known_fails

Add fixedbugs/issue10607.go to known failures.

It cannot run because it uses os/exec. This test is meaningless anyway
because it tests native go compiler linking modes.

Remove unneeded TODOs.

Don't output details of known test failures unless show_known_fails flag
is on.

This makes normal verbose output much more readable and suitable for CI.

Change TestGoRepositoryCompilerTests to stream output as it runs.

Previously, it would only display all of output when it finished.

Fix issue where specifying specific test to run failed to run it.

It was because filepath.Split left a trailing slash after dir, so
""fixedbugs/"" != ""fixedbugs"". Use filepath.Clean on input t.dir to
resolve this.

Always display known fails details if -show_known_fails flag is on
(even without -v).

Previously, both -v and -show_known_fails had to be on.

Also tweak the reproduce command printed to include -show_known_fails
flag, since it's needed.

Remove absolute paths from known fails descriptions."

Fixes #279 (additional findings).

When time package is not imported, it's still possible to internalize a
Date object (into an interface{}). Due to fallthrough being default,
this resulted in Function case running when internalizing Date with no
time package.

That makes no sense, and means that trying to externalize the Date
object back into JavaScript world would fail to produce the original
Date object (also, calling methods on it would obviously fail, since
it's not a real Date object).

For example, consider the following code that doesn't import time
package, it can now run and produce expected results:

	date := js.Global.Get(""Date"").New().Interface()
	js.Global.Get(""console"").Call(""log"", date)"

Fixes #279 (initial report).

The internalization/externalization code only checks if the time
package is present and assumes time.Unix and time.Time are available if
so. Previously, it was possible for time package to be present, but
either time.Unix or time.Time were not (due to dead code elimination),
causing possible panics.

In time package itself, ensure time.Unix func and time.Time struct it
returns are always included (despite DCE) to prevent that from
happening."

This is a test for issue #279.

Proper testing for this issue prevents ""testing"" package from being
imported. So, implement it as a low level single file .go test and
invoke it from backend.

In the time_inexternalization.go, you can use these statements for
manual testing:

	var _ = time.Now()      // Force time.Time not to be DCEed.
	var _ = time.Unix(0, 0) // Force time.Unix (and time.Time implicitly) not to be DCEed.

Adding both of those statements (or just time.Unix one, since it also
includes time.Time indirectly) would cause the test to pass. But a true
fix will be in the compiler itself, in a way that will avoid the
panics/incorrect behavior even when time.Time and/or time.Unix are
DCEed, or time package is not imported at all."

Previously, if there was already a {base}.js file on disk (possibly as
a result of running `gopherjs build` in the past), it would take higher
precedence than the freshly compiled {base}.js file. Fix that by
rearranging the serving precedence logic as follows:

1. {base}.js && valid Go command in folder -> compiled {base}.js
2. {base}.js.map && valid Go command in folder -> compiled {base}.js.map
3. Look in all Go workspaces (GOPATH and GOROOT)
4. index.html && valid Go command in folder -> our own stub index.html

This way, if there's an index.html file on disk, it takes higher
precedence, but not {base}.js and {base}.js.map files."

recompiles on browser refresh. This allows one to switch between code
editor and browser for a faster iteration cycle. No need to also switch
to the terminal to see errors, as now both compilation and runtime

I imagine this problem shows up elsewhere, but the clearest
demonstration I can find is in the behavior of runtime.NumGoroutine():
The second time a goroutine blocks, and every time thereafter, it
invokes the goroutine exiting logic. This causes runtime.NumGoroutine to
underreport the number of goroutines, because the exiting logic includes
decrementing that count. In my testing, runtime.NumGoroutine was often
negative.

The fix is pretty simple. When calling the `r.$blk` closure, return its
output, which may itself be another closure."

Fixes #60.
The behavior should be improved (fixes #60) if user has multiple GOPATH
workspaces.
The behavior should be unchanged if user has a single GOPATH workspace.
First cut at correct GOPATH handling as a list, rather than assuming it
contains no more than 1 entry. It's unfinished and needs more work to
correctly handle all scenarios with multiple GOPATH workspaces, but
it's an improvement over the original version.
Use filepath.Join instead of concatenating strings for path
