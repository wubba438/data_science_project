  This change replaces the use of remote_file with cf_remote_file to
work around two limitations in Chef 0.10:
  - Chef shares its downloading logic of remote_file with its REST
    client.  The REST client decompresses archives when it sees the
    header ""Content-Encoding: gzip"", which is an undesirable behavior
    for remote_file.
  - Chef only uses the specified checksum to trigger update, but it does
    no validation after new remote files are downloaded.

  Our requirement of cf_remote_file:
  - Don't do content decoding magic
  - checksum required and *always* validates the checksum

  Test plan: remove locally compiled ruby and the cached tarballs, run
dev_setup.

to the current behavior of hardcoded paths in manifests when none is

This change moves all iptables calls to shell scripts. There is a shell
script that does global state setup before Warden is started, and a
shell script that does per container setup before it started.

Rules that explicitly allow outgoing traffic per container now live in
chains that are specific to a container. This means that to setup or
teardown the rules for a container, we only need to flush/delete its own
chains and not interfere with rules for other containers.

Added a new library function cf_ruby_install that abstracts the ruby
installation. The current recipes were a hack.

Also fixed rake db:migrate to use bundle exec in dev_setup/bin/vcap.

Note for reviewers, This new library function is a straight copy of the
existing code in ruby/recipes/default.rb with the ruby versions and paths passed
in as parameters i.e. No new real code was added, existing code was moved and
abstracted in a more chef compliant manner.

Testing Done: Deployed a single host cloud.

This changeset prevents resources from leaking when one or more
resources cannot be allocated, while some resources are already
allocated. Previously, this required the client connection to be bound
in order to make it clean up the container after closing. Now, the
container gets initialized with all the resources it needs.

To facilitate this, subclasses of Container::Base should have #acquire
and #release class methods that acquire and release the resources it
needs. These methods should follow the same pattern as shown in
Container::LXC.

Previously, EM executed scripts in the context of a container by
connecting to a Unix socket itself. Because warden shells out for every
other task it does, executing scripts inside a container is now also
done by shelling out. Making this work right using existing tools
proved to be cumbersome, so I included a small C program that either
listens or connects to a Unix socket.

Instead of simply running commands in a fire and forget manner, we want
to optionally run rollback hooks to undo (or try to undo) the mutation
caused by the initial command. When a command halfway through the
sequence fails, it should execute a rollback for all commands up to the
failing one.

This is best-effort approach, as commands may irreversibly mutate global
state. It can therefore be seen best as an abstraction to a set of nested
begin/rescue/end blocks.

* Cloud Controller's welcome message and database adapter are configurable
* Some DEA configuration values are now configurable by chef (defaults are

  1. Move all the default config (that was embeded in
      vcap_dev/vcap_dev_setup/job_manager) into chef cookbooks.
  2. Add postgres CCDB.
  3. Multi host setup for services and dea. This meant separating service
  gateway from service nodes. To this effect we added a service gateway role.

Overall a lot of files have changed, most of those changes are related to
moving all the default config values from the various wrapper scripts to the
cookbooks, especially the new cookbook called deployment which is the holding
place for all the deployment related config options.

* dev_setup/bin/vcap:
  Added vcap to dev_setup/bin instead of just changing bin/vcap. The reason for
  this is that opensource CF code will not be in sync with the
  private repo and internal testing of CF dev_setup scrips would not work if it
  relied on the version of vcap in the opensource repo i.e. bin/vcap. So now we
  just package vcap with dev_setup.

* vcap_dev
  * Since all defaults are now maintained in chef scripts. The chef ""deployment""
  * role/recipe creates a deployment info file that is consumed by this vcap_dev
  * script.
  * The vcap_dev_setup file now saves the list of components that were installed
    for a deployment. This script only starts the components included in that
    list.
  * Uses the vcap binary from dev_setup/bin

* vcap_dev_setup
  Moved a bunch of directory creating code to the deployment cookbook

* Added a CCDB role/recipe.
  * Creates and Configures the CC postgres database.

* Added deployment cookbook
  * Moves all the comon directory creation code here. Note, we should go back
    and see if we really do need all these various directories and probably come
    up with a well designed directory layout.

Testing:
* Ran BVTS. Lift BVT failure needs investigating (I will fix/get to the bottom
  of it before i submit this change)
* Tested the following multi host setup.
  1. Ran mysql database with mysql node on 2 VMs. On a 3rd VM ran everything
  else. Verified that BVTs passed.
  2. Ran dea on 2 different VMs. Ran everything else on a 3rd VM. Verified
  that BVTs passed.

    Note: I have only tested the multihost setup with mysql. I will test mongodb
    and redis before submitting this change, I expect those to run without any
    glitches.

All deployments (multi host and single host) are driven through a templated
config file. Look at dev_setup/deployments/sample* for an example of what this
config file looks like. There is sufficient documentation inside the configs.
But at a high level the user specifes ""jobs"" to ""install"" and jobs that are
""installed"". The ""installed"" jobs have properties associated with them which are
used by jobs that are in the ""install"" list. e.g. nats could be an installed job
and its properties like host/port will be used by the jobs in the install list.
  The deployment code now goes through this config file, does sanity checking to
verify valid job names, valid properties etc. It leverages ""rake"" to manage
dependencies between jobs, look at dev_setup/lib/job_*. So we enforce that all
dependent jobs for a given job are either in the ""installed"" list or in the
""install"" list.  Once all job specs are verified, we generate the chef runlist
on the fly and the deployment proceeds to install the required components using
chef.

NOTE:
1. For now, multi host service deployment is limited to only selecting a service
say ""redis"" and the scripts will install the service node, gateway and the redis
software itself on the same host. We can add more flexibility to this later.
2. For now, we use roles to enforce chef recipe dependencies. It seems to be
working well for what we have right now and I like the fact that there is one
location that maintains the chef dependencies for a given component.
3. For now, not all configurations of multi host are tested. In fact, I have
only
verified NATS. The config file template changes for all the other components
will be added in later changes. e.g. with this change you cannot run ccdb on a
separate host and expect cloud controller to work. But the changes to make it
work are more about adding the right templated fields and testing those changes.

Testing Done: I have verified that I can install ""nats"" on one box and the rest
of the components on a different box and things work fine.

This is part 1 of what I think will be a 3 part change. This change adds the
basic chef recipes to deploy cloudfoundry on a single host. The major change is
to install ruby1.8 and ruby1.9 into a configurable directory. As a result I
added a wrapper script to invoke vcap start that sets up the ruby paths
appropriately before starting indivdual components. Note, these changes do not
download the vcap repo (I will add that in a later change).

Most of the chef recipes were downloaded from the opscode website. Some of them
have been modified to meet our requirements.

Usage:
1.  run dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup to install all the components required
by cloud foundry
2.  run dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev {start, stop, restart} to start cloud foundry
components.

Testing: Installed a base Ubuntu image, ran bvts on cloud foundry installed
using these new scripts.

Right now the README shows up in raw form on Github because there's no file
extension on it. Adding a .rdoc extension makes Github process it as RDoc

In addition I tried adding a heading taking my best guess at what ""vcap""
actually stands for. The README should probably have some kind of heading
even if it's just ""VCAP""."

 1. Enforce ""no follow"" of symlinks when we open the file for download. This
    was done by monkey patching the Rack::File class to add the File::NOFOLLOW
    open flag.

 2. Add a feature that allows users to view/download symlinks that point within
    their app's subdirectory. To check whether the symlink point to the users
    file/subdir, the code makes the assumption that the first subdir under
    ""root"" is the apps subdirectory. e.g.
    if root is "".../blah/app"" then
                 "".../bhah/app/some_app"" is the apps subdirectory.
    The change converts symlinks to real path and checks if that real path begins

1. Enforce ""no follow"" of symlinks when we open the file for download. This
   was done by monkey patching the Rack::File class to add the File::NOFOLLOW
   open flag.

2. Add a feature that allows users to view/download symlinks that point within
their app's subdirectory. To check whether the symlink point to the users
file/subdir, the code makes the assumption that the first subdir under ""root"" is the
apps subdirectory. e.g.
  if root is "".../blah/app"" then
             "".../bhah/app/some_app"" is the apps subdirectory.
  The change converts symlinks to real path and checks if that real path begins
  with the apps subdir, if it does we allow access to that file/subdir."
