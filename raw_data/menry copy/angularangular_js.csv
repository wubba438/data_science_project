Since d6098eeb1, old styles were not removed if `newStyles` specified an
invalid value for the style (e.g. `false`). The assumption was that the
new style would overwrite the old style value, but using an invalid
value made browsers ignore the new value and thus keep the old style.
This would typically happen when guarding a style with a boolean flag;
e.g.: `ng-style=""{backgroundColor: isError && 'red'}""`

This commit essentially revers commit d6098eeb1, whose main purpose was
to work around jquery/jquery#4185. The jQuery issue has been fixed in
3.4.0, so that should not be a problem any more.

Previously, in the required validator, we would read the required setting directly
from attr.required, where it is set by ngRequired.

However, when the control is inside ngRepeat, ngRequired sets it only after a another digest has
passed, which means the initial validation run of ngModel does not include the correct required
setting. (Before commit 0637a2124c4515311a317e0e39926521228fc0af this would not have been a problem,
as every observed value change triggered a validation).

This commit updates in-built validators with observers to prevent
multiple calls to $validate that could happen on initial linking of the directives in
certain circumstances:

- when an input is wrapped in a transclude: element directive (e.g. ngRepeat),
the order of execution between ngModel and the input / validation directives changes so that
the initial observer call happens when ngModel has already been initalized,
leading to another call to $validate, which calls *all* defined validators again.
Without ngRepeat, ngModel hasn't been initialized yet, and $validate does not call the validators.

When using validators with scope expressions, the expression value is not available when
ngModel first runs the validators (e.g. ngMinlength=""myMinlength""). Only in the first call to
the observer does the value become available, making a call to $validate a necessity.

This commit solves the first problem by storing the validation attribute value so we can compare
the current value and the observed value - which will be the same after compilation.

The second problem is solved by parsing the validation expression once in the link function,
so the value is available when ngModel first validates.

By creating attribute directives that watch the value of
media url attributes (e.g. `img[src]`) we caused a conflict
when both `src` and `data-src` were appearing on the

attributes on the element, where AngularJS treats `src` and
`data-src` as synonymous.

This commit ensures that we do not create create such directives
when the media url attribute is a constant (no interpolation).

Because of this (and because we no longer sanitize URLs in the
`$attr.$set()` method, this commit also updates `ngHref` and
`ngSrc` to do a preliminary sanitization of URLs in case there
is no interpolation in the attribute value.

Included changes:

*Update minimum Yarn version from 1.3.2 to 1.10.1*

Yarn 1.10 added the integrity field to the lockfile, making newer Yarn users
have their lockfile changed a lot if they run `yarn`. This commit updates the
required Yarn version to be at least 1.10.1 and changes Travis & Jenkins to use
Yarn 1.10.1

*Change the package.json's engines grunt field to grunt-cli*

The grunt field suggested it's the grunt package version we're checking while
we check the grunt-cli version instead.

*Stop separating Yarn script arguments from script names via "" -- ""*

The "" -- "" separator is necessary in npm but not in Yarn. In fact, it's
deprecated in Yarn and some future version is supposed to start passing this
parameter directly to the scripts which may break them.

*Don't install grunt-cli globally during the build*

It's enough to use `yarn grunt` instead of `grunt` and the global grunt-cli
installation is no longer needed.

*Use `yarn grunt` instead of `yarn run grunt`*

The former form is shorter.

*Don't define the `grunt` Yarn script*

As opposed to npm, `yarn binName` invokes a binary named `binName` exposed
by the respective package so the `grant` Yarn script is no longer needed.

*Allow Node versions newer than 8; bump the minimum*

The `routeToRegExp()` function, introduced by 840b5f0, could not extract
path params if the path contained question mark or hash. Although these
characters would normally be encoded in the path, they are decoded by
`$location.path()`, before being passed to the RegExp returned by
`routeToRegExp()`.

`routeToRegExp()` has to be able to deal with both encoded URL and
decoded path, because it is being shared between `ngRoute` and
`ngMocks`.

This commit fixes the issue, by introducing an `isUrl` option that
allows creating an appropriate RegExp for each usecase."

Properties:

Previously only arbitrary DOM attribute bindings were supported via interpolation such as
`my-attribute=""{{expression}}""` or `ng-attr-my-attribute=""{{expression}}""`, and only a set of
distinct properties could be bound. `ng-prop-*` adds support for binding expressions to any DOM
properties. For example `ng-prop-foo=""x""` will assign the value of the expression `x` to the
`foo` property, and re-assign whenever the expression `x` changes.

Events:

Previously only a distinct set of DOM events could be bound using directives such as `ng-click`,
`ng-blur` etc. `ng-on-*` adds support for binding expressions to any DOM event. For example
`ng-on-bar=""barOccured($event)""` will add a listener to the ""bar"" event and invoke the
`barOccured($event)` expression.

Since HTML attributes are case-insensitive, property and event names are specified in snake_case
for `ng-prop-*` and `ng-on-*`. For example, to bind property `fooBar` use `ng-prop-foo_bar`, to
listen to event `fooBar` use `ng-on-foo_bar`.

`$flushPendingTasks([delay])` allows flushing all pending tasks (or up
to a specific delay). This includes `$timeout`s, `$q` promises and tasks
scheduled via `$rootScope.$applyAsync()` and `$rootScope.$evalAsync()`.
(ATM, it only flushes tasks scheduled via `$browser.defer()`, which does
not include `$http` requests and `$route` transitions.)

`$verifyNoPendingTasks([taskType])` allows verifying that there are no
pending tasks (in general or of a specific type). This includes tasks
flushed by `$flushPendingTasks()` as well as pending `$http` requests
and in-progress `$route` transitions.

Background:
`ngMock/$timeout` has `flush()` and `verifyNoPendingTasks()` methods,
but they take all kinds of tasks into account which is confusing. For
example, `$timeout.verifyNoPendingTasks()` can fail (even if there are
no pending timeouts) because of an unrelated pending `$http` request.

This behavior is retained for backwards compatibility, but the new
methods are more generic (and thus less confusing) and also allow
more fine-grained control (when appropriate).

Previously, all pending async tasks (tracked via `$browser`) are treated
the same. I.e. things like `$$testability.whenStable()` and
`ngMock#$timeout.verifyNoPendingTasks()` take all tasks into account.

Yet, in some cases we might be interested in specific tasks only. For
example, if one wants to verify there are no pending `$timeout`s, they
don't care if there are other pending tasks, such as `$http` requests.
Similarly, one might want to get notified when all `$http` requests have
completed and does not care about pending promises.

This commit adds support for more granular task tracking, by enabling
callers to specify the type of task that is being added/removed from the
queue and enabling listeners to be triggered when specific types of
tasks are completed (even if there are more pending tasks of different
types).

The change is backwards compatible. I.e. calling the affected methods
with no explicit task-type, behaves the same as before.

`nextSibling` (in order to correctly handle multi-element directives).

Once the nodes are compiled, they will be either moved to a new
container element or the `jqLite` wrapper is release making them
eligible for garbage collection. In both cases, the original
`DocumentFragment` container should be eligible for garbage collection
too.

Background:
ngAnimate writes helper classes to DOM elements to see if animations are defined on them. If many
elements have the same definition, and the same parent, we can cache the definition and skip the
application of the helper classes altogether. This helps particularly with large ngRepeat
collections.

By default, pressing spacebar causes the browser to scroll down.
However, when a native button is focused, the button is clicked instead.

`ngAria`'s `ngClick` directive, sets elements up to behave like buttons.
For example, it adds `role=""button""` and forwards `ENTER` and `SPACEBAR`
keypresses to the `click` handler (to emulate the behavior of native
buttons).

Yet, pressing spacebar on such an element, still invokes the default
browser behavior of scrolling down.

This commit fixes this, by calling `preventDefault()` on the keyboard
event, thus preventing the default scrolling behavior and making custom
buttons behave closer to native ones.

Specific errors, such as those during nested module loading, can create very long
error urls because the error message includes the error stack. These urls create visual
clutter in the browser console, are often not clickable, and may be rejected
by the docs page because they are simply too long.

We've already made improvements to the error display in #16283, which excludes
the error url from error parameters, which results in cleaner error messages.

Further, modern browsers restrict console message length intelligently.

This option can still be useful for older browsers like Internet Explorer, or
in general to reduce visual clutter in the console.

Now that we don't need to support `preAssignBindingsEnabled` (removed in #15782),
complexity introduced in `$controller` by #7645 can be removed.

One difference with the previous implementation is that all non-ES2015-class controller instances
were available on the element before calling their constructors. Now it depends on the relative
order of controllers. Controller constructors shouldn't be used to access other controllers
(e.g. via `$element.controller(directiveName)`). The recommended way is to use the `require`
property of the directive definition object and the life cycle hooks `$onChanges` or `$onInit`.

The `manualLowercase` & `manualUppercase` functions were inspired by Google Caja
code which worked around Java issues where problems with `toLowerCase`
working differently in Turkish locale are well known[1]. In JavaScript
`String#toLowerCase` is defined in the ECMAScript spec and all implementations
are required to lowercase I in the same way, regardless of the current locale.
Differences may (and do) happen only in `String#toLocaleLowerCase`.

The mirroring of the Java workarounds in Caja was needed due to an old Rhino bug.
Rhino is a pre-Nashorn JavaScript interpreter written in Java and it used to
delegate `String.prototype.toLowerCase` to `java.lang.String.toLowerCase`. This
has since been long fixed.

Other libraries doing string normalization, like jQuery or DOMPurify don't
apply special lowercasing logic in a Turkish environment.

Therefore, the `manualLowercase` & `manualUppercase` logic is dead code in
AngularJS and can be removed.

Also, the `manualLowercase` & `manualUppercase` functions are incomplete; they
only lowercase ASCII characters which is different to native
`String#toLowerCase`. Since those functions are used in many places in the
library, they would break a lot of code. For example, the lowercase filter would
not lowercase Ω to ω but leave it as Ω.

Fixes #15869

BREAKING CHANGE:

Before this commit `removeData()` invoked on an element removed its event
handlers as well. If you want to trigger a full cleanup of an element, change:

```js
elem.removeData();
```

to:

```js
angular.element.cleanData(elem);
```

In most cases, though, cleaning up after an element is supposed to be done
only when it's removed from the DOM as well; in such cases the following:

```js
elem.remove();
```

will remove event handlers as well."

Setting the 'disabled' attribute on an element that has descendant elements has unexpected behavior in Internet Explorer 11.

* Input elements that are descendants have the text content of the 'placeholder' attribute inserted as the value (and it is not removed when typing in the field).
* Select elements that are descendants are disabled.

To avoid this issue, it is important to not set `disabled` or `ng-disabled` on an element that has descendant form elements. Normally these should only be used on actual form controls so the issue would not manifest.

The issue can also appear if a directive/component is named 'disabled' or takes an attribute named 'disabled' as an input/output attribute, so avoid these.

Previously, action-specific interceptors and `success`/`error` callbacks
were executed in inconsistent relative orders and in a way that did not
meet the general expectation for interceptor behavior (e.g. ability to
recover from errors, performing asynchronous operations, etc).

This commit fixes the behavior to make it more consistent and expected.
The main differences are that `success`/`error` callbacks will now be
run _after_ `response`/`responseError` interceptors complete (even if
interceptors return a promise) and the correct callback will be called
based on the result of the interceptor (e.g. if the `responseError`
interceptor recovers from an error, the `success` callback will be
called).
See also https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/9334#issuecomment-364650642.

This commit also replaces the use of `success`/`error` callbacks in the
docs with using the returned promise.

Fixes #6731
Fixes #9334
Closes #6865

Closes #16446

BREAKING CHANGE:

If you are not using `success` or `error` callbacks with `$resource`,
your app should not be affected by this change.

If you are using `success` or `error` callbacks (with or without
response interceptors), one (subtle) difference is that throwing an
error inside the callbacks will not propagate to the returned
`$promise`. Therefore, you should try to use the promises whenever
possible. E.g.:

```js
// Avoid
User.query(function onSuccess(users) { throw new Error(); }).
  $promise.
  catch(function onError() { /* Will not be called. */ });

// Prefer
User.query().
  $promise.
  then(function onSuccess(users) { throw new Error(); }).
  catch(function onError() { /* Will be called. */ });
```

Finally, if you are using `success` or `error` callbacks with response
interceptors, the callbacks will now always run _after_ the interceptors
(and wait for them to resolve in case they return a promise).
Previously, the `error` callback was called before the `responseError`
interceptor and the `success` callback was synchronously called after
the `response` interceptor. E.g.:

```js
var User = $resource('/api/users/:id', {id: '@id'}, {
  get: {
    method: 'get',
    interceptor: {
      response: function(response) {
        console.log('responseInterceptor-1');
        return $timeout(1000).then(function() {
          console.log('responseInterceptor-2');
          return response.resource;
        });
      },
      responseError: function(response) {
        console.log('responseErrorInterceptor-1');
        return $timeout(1000).then(function() {
          console.log('responseErrorInterceptor-2');
          return $q.reject('Ooops!');
        });
      }
    }
  }
});
var onSuccess = function(value) { console.log('successCallback', value); };
var onError = function(error) { console.log('errorCallback', error); };

// Assuming the following call is successful...
User.get({id: 1}, onSuccess, onError);
  // Old behavior:
  //   responseInterceptor-1
  //   successCallback, {/* Promise object */}
  //   responseInterceptor-2
  // New behavior:
  //   responseInterceptor-1
  //   responseInterceptor-2
  //   successCallback, {/* User object */}

// Assuming the following call returns an error...
User.get({id: 2}, onSuccess, onError);
  // Old behavior:
  //   errorCallback, {/* Response object */}
  //   responseErrorInterceptor-1
  //   responseErrorInterceptor-2
  // New behavior:
  //   responseErrorInterceptor-1
  //   responseErrorInterceptor-2
  //   errorCallback, Ooops!
```"

Previously, `$templateRequest` returned the raw `$http` response data on the
first request for a template and then the value from the cache for subsequent
requests.

If the value is transformed when being added to the cache (by decorating
`$templateCache.put`)  the return value of `$templateRequest` would be
inconsistent depending upon when the request is made.

This commit ensures the cached value is returned instead of the raw `$http`
response data, thus allowing the `$templateCache` service to be decorated.

BREAKING CHANGE:

$animate.cancel(runner) now rejects the underlying
promise and calls the catch() handler on the runner
returned by $animate functions (enter, leave, move,
addClass, removeClass, setClass, animate).
Previously it would resolve the promise as if the animation
had ended successfully.

Example:

```js
var runner = $animate.addClass('red');
runner.then(function() { console.log('success')});
runner.catch(function() { console.log('cancelled')});

runner.cancel();
```

Pre-1.7.0, this logs 'success', 1.7.0 and later it logs 'cancelled'.
To migrate, add a catch() handler to your animation runners."

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, `angular.isArray()` was an alias for `Array.isArray()`.
Therefore, objects that prototypally inherit from `Array` where not
considered arrays. Now such objects are considered arrays too.

This change affects several other methods that use `angular.isArray()`
under the hood, such as `angular.copy()`, `angular.equals()`,
`angular.forEach()`, and `angular.merge()`.

This in turn affects how dirty checking treats objects that prototypally
inherit from `Array` (e.g. MobX observable arrays). AngularJS will now
be able to handle these objects better when copying or watching."

Thanks to @rjamet for the original work on this feature.

This is a large patch to handle URLs with the $sce service, similarly to HTML context.

Where we previously sanitized URL attributes when setting attribute value inside the
`$compile` service, we now only apply an `$sce` context requirement and leave the
`$interpolate` service to deal with sanitization.

This commit introduces a new `$sce` context called `MEDIA_URL`, which represents
a URL used as a source for a media element that is not expected to execute code, such as
image, video, audio, etc.
The context hierarchy is setup so that a value trusted as `URL` is also trusted in the
`MEDIA_URL` context, in the same way that the a value trusted as `RESOURCE_URL` is also
trusted in the `URL` context (and transitively also the `MEDIA_URL` context).

The `$sce` service will now automatically attempt to sanitize non-trusted values that
require the `URL` or `MEDIA_URL` context:

* When calling `getTrustedMediaUrl()` a value that is not already a trusted `MEDIA_URL`
will be sanitized using the `imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist`.
* When calling `getTrustedUrl()` a value that is not already a trusted `URL` will be
sanitized using the `aHrefSanitizationWhitelist`.

This results in behaviour that closely matches the previous sanitization behaviour.

To keep rough compatibility with existing apps, we need to allow concatenation of values
that may contain trusted contexts. The following approach is taken for situations that
require a `URL` or `MEDIA_URL` secure context:

* A single trusted value is trusted, e.g. `""{{trustedUrl}}""` and will not be sanitized.
* A single non-trusted value, e.g. `""{{ 'javascript:foo' }}""`, will be handled by
  `getTrustedMediaUrl` or `getTrustedUrl)` and sanitized.
* Any concatenation of values (which may or may not be trusted) results in a
  non-trusted type that will be handled by `getTrustedMediaUrl` or `getTrustedUrl` once the
  concatenation is complete.
  E.g. `""javascript:{{safeType}}""` is a concatenation of a non-trusted and a trusted value,
  which will be sanitized as a whole after unwrapping the `safeType` value.
* An interpolation containing no expressions will still be handled by `getTrustedMediaUrl` or
  `getTrustedUrl`, whereas before this would have been short-circuited in the `$interpolate`
  service. E.g. `""some/hard/coded/url""`. This ensures that `ngHref` and similar directives
  still securely, even if the URL is hard-coded into a template or index.html (perhaps by
  server-side rendering).

BREAKING CHANGES:

If you use `attrs.$set` for URL attributes (a[href] and img[src]) there will no
longer be any automated sanitization of the value. This is in line with other
programmatic operations, such as writing to the innerHTML of an element.

If you are programmatically writing URL values to attributes from untrusted
input then you must sanitize it yourself. You could write your own sanitizer or copy
the private `$$sanitizeUri` service.

Note that values that have been passed through the `$interpolate` service within the
`URL` or `MEDIA_URL` will have already been sanitized, so you would not need to sanitize
these values again."

Previously, `null` values where sorted using type `string` resulting in a string
comparison. `undefined` values where compared to other values by type and were
usually considered greater than other values (since their type happens to start
with a `u`), but this was coincidental.

This commit ensures that `null` and `undefined ` values are explicitly
considered greater than other values (with `undefined` > `null`) and will
effectively be put at the end of the sorted list (for ascending order sorting).

Closes #15294

Closes #16376

BREAKING CHANGE:

When using `orderBy` to sort arrays containing `null` values, the `null` values
will be considered ""greater than"" all other values, except for `undefined`.
Previously, they were sorted as strings. This will result in different (but more
intuitive) sorting order.

Before:
```js
orderByFilter(['a', undefined, 'o', null, 'z']);
//--> 'a', null, 'o', 'z', undefined
```

After:
```js
orderByFilter(['a', undefined, 'o', null, 'z']);

This commit adds `request` and `requestError` interceptors for `$resource`, as
per the documentation found for `$http` interceptors. It is important to note
that returning an error at this stage of the request - before the call to
`$http` - will completely bypass any global interceptors and/or recovery
handlers, as those are added to a separate context. This is intentional;
intercepting a request before it is passed to `$http` indicates that the
resource itself has made a decision, and that it accepts the responsibility for
recovery.

Closes #5146

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, calling a `$resource` method would synchronously call
`$http`. Now, it will be called asynchronously (regardless if a
`request`/`requestError` interceptor has been defined.

This is not expected to affect applications at runtime, since the
overall operation is asynchronous already, but may affect assertions in
tests. For example, if you want to assert that `$http` has been called
with specific arguments as a result of a `$resource` call, you now need
to run a `$digest` first, to ensure the (possibly empty) request
interceptor promise has been resolved.

Before:
```js
it('...', function() {
  $httpBackend.expectGET('/api/things').respond(...);
  var Things = $resource('/api/things');
  Things.query();

  expect($http).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...);
});
```

After:
```js
it('...', function() {
  $httpBackend.expectGET('/api/things').respond(...);
  var Things = $resource('/api/things');
  Things.query();
  $rootScope.$digest();

  expect($http).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...);
});

The original fix for #16312 included changing how `$location.url(value)`
decoded the special characters passed to it as a setter.
This broke a number of use cases (mostly involving the ui-router).

Further analysis appears to show that we can solve #16312, to prevent
urls being rewritten with decoded values, without modifying the
behaviour of `$location.url`.

This commit reverts changes to `$location.url(value)` so that encoded
chars will once again be decoded and passed to `$location.path(value)`.
In particular it will convert encoded forward slashes, which changes how
the path is updated, since e.g. `a/b/%2Fc%2Fd` will become `a/b/c/d`.
While this is arguably not ""correct"", it appears that there are too many
use cases relying upon this behaviour."

This commit changes how input elements use the private $$parserName
property on the ngModelController to name parse errors. Until now,
the input types (number, date etc.) would set $$parserName when
the inputs were initialized, which meant that any other parsers on
the ngModelController would also be named after that type. The
effect of that was that the `$error` property and the `ng-invalid-...`
class would always be that of the built-in parser, even if the custom
parser had nothing to do with it.

The new behavior is that the $$parserName is only set if the built-in
parser is invalid i.e. returns `undefined`.

Also, $$parserName has been removed from input[email] and input[url],
as these types do not have a built-in parser anymore.

Closes #14292
Closes #10076
Closes #16347

BREAKING CHANGE:

*Custom* parsers that fail to parse on input types ""email"", ""url"", ""number"", ""date"", ""month"",
""time"", ""datetime-local"", ""week"", do no longer set `ngModelController.$error[inputType]`, and
the `ng-invalid-[inputType]` class. Also, custom parsers on input type ""range"" do no
longer set `ngModelController.$error.number` and the `ng-invalid-number` class.

Instead, any custom parsers on these inputs set `ngModelController.$error.parse` and
`ng-invalid-parse`. This change was made to make distinguishing errors from built-in parsers
and custom parsers easier."

Closes #15411
Closes #16335

BREAKING CHANGE:

the 'default' key in 'debounce' now only debounces the default event, i.e. the event
that is added as an update trigger by the different input directives automatically.

Previously, it also applied to other update triggers defined in 'updateOn' that
did not have a corresponding key in the 'debounce'.

This behavior is now supported via a special wildcard / catch-all key: '*'.

See the following example:

Pre-1.7:
'mouseup' is also debounced by 500 milliseconds because 'default' is applied:
```
ng-model-options=""{
  updateOn: 'default blur mouseup',
  debounce: { 'default': 500, 'blur': 0 }
}
```

1.7:
The pre-1.7 behavior can be re-created by setting '*' as a catch-all debounce value:
```
ng-model-options=""{
  updateOn: 'default blur mouseup',
  debounce: { '*': 500, 'blur': 0 }
}
```

In contrast, when only 'default' is used, 'blur' and 'mouseup' are not debounced:
```
ng-model-options=""{
  updateOn: 'default blur mouseup',
  debounce: { 'default': 500 }
}
```"

BREAKING CHANGE

`input[type=number]` with `ngModel` now validates the input for the `max`/`min` restriction against

This affects apps that use `$parsers` or `$formatters` to transform the input / model value.

If you rely on the $modelValue validation, you can overwrite the `min`/`max` validator from a custom directive, as seen in the following example directive definition object:

```
{
  restrict: 'A',
  require: 'ngModel',
  link: function(scope, element, attrs, ctrl) {
    var maxValidator = ctrl.$validators.max;

    ctrk.$validators.max = function(modelValue, viewValue) {

Browsers mutate attributes values such as `&#12288;javascript:alert(1)`
when they are written to the DOM via `innerHTML` in various vendor specific
ways.

In Chrome (<62), this mutation removed the preceding ""whitespace"" resulting
in a value that could end up being executed as JavaScript.

Here is an example of what could happen:
https://plnkr.co/edit/Y6EsbsuDgd18YTn1oARu?p=preview
If you run that in Chrome 61 you will get a dialog box pop up.

There is background here:
http://www.nds.rub.de/media/emma/veroeffentlichungen/2013/12/10/mXSS-CCS13.pdf

The sanitizer has a bit of code that triggers this mutation on an inert piece
of DOM, before we try to sanitize it:
https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/817ac567/src/ngSanitize/sanitize.js#L406-L417

Chrome 62 does not appear to mutate this particular string any more, instead
it just leaves the ""whitespace"" in place. This probably means that Chrome 62
is no longer vulnerable to this specific attack vector; but there may be
other mutating strings that we haven't found, which are vulnerable.

Since we are leaving the mXSS check in place, the sanitizer should still
be immune to any strings that try to utilise this attack vector.

This commit uses `trim()` to remove the IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE ""whitespace""
before sanitizing, which allows us to expose this mXSS test to all browsers
rather than just Chrome.

input[radio] and inout[checkbox] now listen on the change event instead
of the click event. This fixes issue with 3rd party libraries that trigger
a change event on inputs, e.g. Bootstrap 3 custom checkbox / radio button
toggles.
It also makes it easier to prevent specific events that can cause a checkbox / radio
to change, e.g. click events. Previously, this was difficult because the custom click
handler had to be registered before the input directive's click handler.

It is possible that radio and checkbox listened to click because IE8 has
broken support for listening on change, see http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/change.html

Closes #4516
Closes #14667
Closes #14685

BREAKING CHANGE:

`input[radio]` and `input[checkbox]` now listen to the ""change"" event instead of the ""click"" event.
Most apps should not be affected, as ""change"" is automatically fired by browsers after ""click""
happens.

Two scenarios might need migration:

- Custom click events:

Before this change, custom click event listeners on radio / checkbox would be called after the
input element and `ngModel` had been updated, unless they were specifically registered before
the built-in click handlers.
After this change, they are called before the input is updated, and can call event.preventDefault()
to prevent the input from updating.

If an app uses a click event listener that expects ngModel to be updated when it is called, it now
needs to register a change event listener instead.

- Triggering click events:

Conventional trigger functions:

The change event might not be fired when the input element is not attached to the document. This
can happen in **tests** that compile input elements and
trigger click events on them. Depending on the browser (Chrome and Safari) and the trigger method,
the change event will not be fired when the input isn't attached to the document.

Before:

```js
    it('should update the model', inject(function($compile, $rootScope) {
      var inputElm = $compile('<input type=""checkbox"" ng-model=""checkbox"" />')($rootScope);

      inputElm[0].click(); // Or different trigger mechanisms, such as jQuery.trigger()
      expect($rootScope.checkbox).toBe(true);
    });
```

With this patch, `$rootScope.checkbox` might not be true, because the click event
hasn't triggered the change event. To make the test, work append the inputElm to the app's
`$rootElement`, and the `$rootElement` to the `$document`.

After:

```js
    it('should update the model', inject(function($compile, $rootScope, $rootElement, $document) {
      var inputElm = $compile('<input type=""checkbox"" ng-model=""checkbox"" />')($rootScope);

      $rootElement.append(inputElm);
      $document.append($rootElement);

      inputElm[0].click(); // Or different trigger mechanisms, such as jQuery.trigger()
      expect($rootScope.checkbox).toBe(true);
    });
```

`triggerHandler()`:

If you are using this jQuery / jqLite function on the input elements, you don't have to attach
the elements to the document, but instead change the triggered event to ""change"". This is because
`triggerHandler(event)` only triggers the exact event when it has been added by jQuery / jqLite."

In commit ce49edc08b3d642f3768f4282d391062d2f83037, we switched to npm info (now yarn info)
instead of the local git repository information to get the list of currently available versions for
the docs app. This means that during a release the version that is currently tagged is not yet
available on npm, and therefore our list of available versions is incomplete.

We now simply add the current build version (read from build/version.json) to the list of all
versions if it fulfills the following conditions:

- it is not a snapshot build
- it is not already part of the list of all versions (i.e. if you are building locally on a tagged commit)

Previously, when the response data was JSON-like, `$http` would try to
`JSON.parse` them and throw if they were not actually JSON. This happened even
if the `Content-Type` header was not `application/json`. As a result, it was not
possible to send `text/plain` data that looked like JSON (e.g. `{abcd}`).
The reason for not relying solely on the `Content-Type` is that many users serve
JSON data without proper headers.

This commit fixes it by returning the raw response text if `$http` fails to
parse a JSON-like response, unless the `Content-Type` header has been explicitly
set to `application/json` (in which case it will still fail with an error).

Previously, `.catch(noop)` was used on a rejected timeout/interval to prevent an unhandled rejection error (introduced in #c9dffde1cb). However this would schedule a deferred task to run the `noop`. If the cancelling was outside a digest this could cause a new digest such as with the ng-model `debounce` option.

For unit testing, this means that it's no longer necessary to use `$timeout.flush()` when a `$timeout` has been cancelled outside of a digest. Previously, this was necessary to execute the deferred task added by `.catch(noop).
There's an example of such a change in this commit's changeset in the file `/test/ngAnimate/animateCssSpec.js`.

In IE 9 console methods don't inherit from Function.prototype and, hence, don't
have apply. Until recently IE 9 logging in AngularJS was restricted to the
first 2 parameters but that changed as we could just reuse
Function.prototype.apply everywhere, creating one code path for all browsers.
Therefore, we can now run all tests in modes where apply exists on logging
methods and where it doesn't.

When a regular / ngOptions select has an explicit *empty* option, this option can be selected

When the model is set to a value that does not match any option value, and is also not
`null` or `undefined`, the *unknown* option is inserted and selected - this is an explicit marker
that the select is in an invalid / unknown state, which is different from an allowed empty state.

Previously, regular selects followed this logic, whereas ngOptions selects selected the empty
option in the case described above.

This patch makes the behavior consistent between regular / ngOptions select - the latter will now
insert and select the unknown option. The order of the options has been fixed to unknown -> empty

The previous implementation of jqLite didn't use cleanData from the jqLite

monkey-patch jqLite.cleanData similarly to how you can do it in jQuery.

The cleanData method is not meant to be called directly by userland code;
its purpose is mainly to be able to be monkey-patched; therefore, the previous
implementation didn't make a lot of sense.

Closes #15782

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, the `$compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled` flag was supported.
The flag controlled whether bindings were available inside the controller
constructor or only in the `$onInit` hook. The bindings are now no longer
available in the constructor.

To migrate your code:

1. If you haven't invoked `$compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled()` you
don't have to do anything to migrate.

2. If you specified `$compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled(false)`, you
can remove that statement - since AngularJS 1.6.0 this is the default so your
app should still work even in AngularJS 1.6 after such removal. Afterwards,
migrating to AngularJS 1.7.0 shouldn't require any further action.

3. If you specified `$compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled(true)` you need
to first migrate your code so that the flag can be flipped to `false`. The
instructions on how to do that are available in the ""Migrating from 1.5 to 1.6""
guide:
https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/migration#migrating-from-1-5-to-1-6
Afterwards, remove the `$compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled(true)`

Closes #15761
Closes #15755

BREAKING CHANGE:

The `ngClick` directive from the ngTouch module has been removed, and with it the
corresponding `$touchProvider` and `$touch` service.

If you have included ngTouch v1.5.0 or higher in your application, and have not
changed the value of `$touchProvider.ngClickOverrideEnabled()`, or injected and used the `$touch`
service, then there are no migration steps for your code. Otherwise you must remove references to
the provider and service.

The `ngClick` override directive had been deprecated and by default disabled since v1.5.0,
because of buggy behavior in edge cases, and a general trend to avoid special touch based
overrides of click events. In modern browsers, it should not be necessary to use a touch override
library:

- Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari remove the 300ms delay when
  `<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">` is set.
- Internet Explorer 10+, Edge, Safari, and Chrome remove the delay on elements that have the
  `touch-action` css property is set to `manipulation`.

Previously, `xlink:href` on SVG's `<a>` and `<image>` elements, was
`$sce.RESOURCE_URL`. While this makes sense for other `xlink:href` usecases, it
was an overkill for these elements.
This commit lowers the `xlink:href` security context for these specific
elements, treating it in the same way as `a[href]` or `img[src]` respectively.
The `xlink:href` security context for other elements is not affected.

BREAKING CHANGE:

In the unlikely case that an app relied on RESOURCE_URL whitelisting for the
purpose of binding to the `xlink:href` property of SVG's `<a>` or `<image>`
elements and if the values do not pass the regular URL sanitization, they will
break.

To fix this you need to ensure that the values used for binding to the affected
`xlink:href` contexts are considered safe URLs, e.g. by whitelisting them in
`$compileProvider`'s `aHrefSanitizationWhitelist` (for `<a>` elements) or
`imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist` (for `<image>` elements).

In IE9-11 + Edge, the selected options were previously incorrect under the following

- shift+click or shift+down/up is used to add to the selection (any number of options)

In these cases, only the last of the previously selected options and the newly selected
options would be selected.

The problems seems to be that the render engine gets confused when an option that
already has selected = true gets selected = true set again.

Note that this is not testable via unit test because it's not possible to simulate
click / keyboard events on option elements (the events are delegated to the select element
change event), and the problem also doesn't appear when modifying the option elements directly
and then using the selectController API. It seems that this only happens when you manipulate the
select directly in the user interface.

`error` callback (which would handle request errors).

The handler was added too ""eagrly"" and as a result would swallow errors thrown

the errors. In tests though (where `$exceptionHandler` rethrows by default), it

Avoiding deep watchers for array/object literals will improve watcher
performance of all literals passed as one-way bindings, especially those
containing references to large/complex objects.

BREAKING CHANGE:
Previously when a literal value was passed into a directive/component via
one-way binding it would be watched with a deep watcher.

For example, for `<my-component input=""[a]"">`, a new instance of the array
would be passed into the directive/component (and trigger $onChanges) not
only if `a` changed but also if any sub property of `a` changed such as
`a.b` or `a.b.c.d.e` etc.

This also means a new but equal value for `a` would NOT trigger such a
change.

Now literal values use an input-based watch similar to other directive/component
one-way bindings. In this context inputs are the non-constant parts of the
literal. In the example above the input would be `a`. Changes are only
triggered when the inputs to the literal change.

Previously, `base[href]` didn't have an SCE context. This was not ideal, because
`base[href]` affects the behavior of all relative URLs across the page.
Furthermore, since #15145, `base[href]` also affects which URLs are considered
trusted under the 'self' policy for white- or black-listed resource URLs.

This commit tightens the security of Angular apps, by adding `base[href]` to the
list of RESOURCE_URL context attributes, essentially putting the same
constraints on bindings to `base[href]` as on iframe or script sources.

Refer to the
[`$sce` API docs](https://code.angularjs.org/snapshot/docs/api/ng/service/$sce)
for more info on SCE trusted contexts.

Closes #15597

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, `<base href=""{{ $ctrl.baseUrl }}"" />` would not require `baseUrl` to
be trusted as a RESOURCE_URL. Now, `baseUrl` will be sent to `$sce`'s
RESOURCE_URL checks. By default, it will break unless `baseUrl` is of the same
origin as the application document.

Refer to the
[`$sce` API docs](https://code.angularjs.org/snapshot/docs/api/ng/service/$sce)
for more info on how to trust a value in a RESOURCE_URL context.

Also, concatenation in trusted contexts is not allowed, which means that the
following won't work: `<base href=""/something/{{ $ctrl.partialPath }}"" />`.

Either construct complex values in a controller (recommended):

```js
this.baseUrl = '/something/' + this.partialPath;
```
```html
<base href=""{{ $ctrl.baseUrl }}"" />
```

Or use string concatenation in the interpolation expression (not recommended
except for the simplest of cases):

```html
<base href=""{{ '/something/' + $ctrl.partialPath }}"" />
```"

If an attacker can inject a `<base>` tag into the page, they can circumvent SCE
protections. However, injecting a `<base>` tag typically requires the ability to
inject arbitrary HTML into the page, which is a more serious vulnerabilty than
bypassing SCE.

Previously, when the URL was changed directly (e.g. via `location.href`) during
a `$digest` (e.g. via `scope.$evalAsync()` or `promise.then()`) the change was
not handled correctly, unless a `popstate` or `hashchange` event was fired
synchronously.

This was an issue when calling `history.pushState()/replaceState()` in all
browsers, since these methods do not emit any event. This was also an issue when
setting `location.href` in IE11, where (unlike other browsers) no `popstate`
event is fired at all for hash-only changes ([known bug][1]) and the
`hashchange` event is fired asynchronously (which is too late).

This commit fixes both usecases by:

1. Keeping track of `$location` setter methods being called and only processing
   a URL change if it originated from such a call. If there is a URL difference
   but no setter method has been called, this means that the browser URL/history
   has been updated directly and the change hasn't yet been propagated to
   `$location` (e.g. due to no event being fired synchronously or at all).
2. Checking for URL/state changes at the end of the `$digest`, in order to
   detect changes via `history` methods (that took place during the `$digest`).

Previously, `$browser.$$checkUrlChange()` (which was run before each `$digest`)
would only detect an external change (i.e. not via `$location`) to the browser
URL. External changes to `history.state` would not be detected and propagated to
`$location`.

This would not be a problem if changes were followed by a `popstate` or
`hashchange` event (which would call `cacheStateAndFireUrlChange()`). But since
`history.pushState()/replaceState()` do not fire any events, calling these
methods manually would result in `$location` getting out-of-sync with the actual
history state.

This was not detected in tests, because the mocked `window.history` would
incorrectly trigger `popstate` when calling `pushState()/replaceState()`, which
""covered"" the bug.

This commit fixes it by always calling `cacheState()`, before looking for and
propagating a URL/state change."

Some browsers (e.g. Safari 9.x, PhantomJS) do not set `link.origin/protocol`

Angular from scripts without a `src` attribute (i.e. inline scripts).
Inline scripts are on the same origin as the loading page, so auto-bootstraping
should be allowed.

Previously, when updating the value of a `select[multiple]` element, all options
were first set to `selected = false` and then the selected ones were set to
`true`. By setting an already selected option to `selected = false` and then
`true` again - essentially unselecting and reselecting it - caused some browsers
(including Firefox, IE and under some circumstances Chrome) to unexpectedly
scroll to the last selected option.

This commit fixes it by ensuring that the `selected` property is only set if its
current value is different than the new one and even then it is set to its final
value at once (i.e. without first setting it to `false`), thus avoiding the
undesirable behavior.

This commit makes jqLite consistent with jQuery, which silently ignores a call

When the ""empty option"" element contains a transclusion directive, the result of the compilation always includes a comment node. Since we are adding / removing the ""selected"" attribute on the empty option, we need to make sure it's an actual element.

To solve this, we take advantage of the fact the each option element has an option directive that tries to register the option with the selectController. With ngOptions, this registerOption function is normally noop'd since it's not possible to add dynamic options. Now if the result of the empty option compilation is a comment, we re-define the function so that it catches empty options when they are actually linked / rendered.

Currently, ngdoc `@method` ignores `@example` tags and does not output them.
This is usually not a problem, as examples are mostly defined directly
in the `@description` via code blocks or `<example>`
elements. However, some methods still have `@example` tags (possibly
from a previous docs version).

While not absolutely necessary, having special markup for Examples
makes them a) easier to find visually in the docs, and b) easier
to link to as they will have a unique id.

Since Chrome 53-57+, the reported size of `<foreignObject>` elements and their

due to such settings.

In order to avoid false negatives, we now compare against the size of the

ngIf, ngInclude, ngSwitch, and ngView now use the `done` callback functions on animation runners returned
by leave/enter animations to do internal cleanup (and $anchorScroll for ngInclude and ngView).
Previously, they were using promise callbacks (`then`), which caused an unnessecary digest.

Background:

In https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/bf0f5502b1bbfddc5cdd2f138efd9188b8c652a9, animation
promises where introduced instead of animation callbacks. These promises were however not tied to
the digest cycle, so you had to manually call `$apply` inside them.

This was changed in https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c8700f04fb6fb5dc21ac24de8665c0476d6db5ef,
so animation promise callbacks would always trigger a `$digest`. This meant that several built-in
directives would now trigger additional digests on leave (ngIf, ngSwitch) or enter/leave (ngInclude,
ngView). The `done` callback, which receives a single argument indicating success / failure was
introduced to allow digest-less responses, but wasn't applied to these directives.

Note that this applies to all calls to $animate.enter/leave, even if ngAnimate isn't included, and
no actual animations are running, because the animation runner code is in the core ng module.

Previously, you had to apply a complete set of `ngModelOptions` at many places in
the DOM where you might want to modify just one or two settings.

This change allows more general settings to be applied nearer to the root of the DOM
and then for more specific settings to inherit those general settings further down
in the DOM.

To prevent unwanted inheritance you must opt-in on a case by case basis:
* To inherit as single property you simply provide the special value `""$inherit""`.
* To inherit all properties not specified locally then include a property `""*"": ""$inherit""`.

Closes #10922
Closes #15389

BREAKING CHANGE:

The programmatic API for `ngModelOptions` has changed. You must now read options
via the `ngModelController.$options.getOption(name)` method, rather than accessing the
option directly as a property of the `ngModelContoller.$options` object. This does not
affect the usage in templates and only affects custom directives that might have been
reading options for their own purposes.

One benefit of these changes, though, is that the `ngModelControler.$options` property
is now guaranteed to be defined so there is no need to check before accessing.

So, previously:

```
var myOption = ngModelController.$options && ngModelController.$options['my-option'];
```

and now:

```
var myOption = ngModelController.$options.getOption('my-option');
```"

This means in the following examples the radio is no longer checked:

```
  <!-- this.selected = 0 -->

  <!-- this.selected = 0; this.value = false; -->

conversion so that they will match with strict conversion."

Fixes #15350
Closes #15352

BREAKING CHANGE: Previously, $compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled was
set to true by default. This means bindings were pre-assigned in component
constructors. In Angular 1.5+ the place to put the initialization logic
relying on bindings being present is the controller $onInit method.

To migrate follow the example below:

Before:

```js
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .component('myComponent', {
    bindings: {value: '<'},
    controller: function() {
      this.doubleValue = this.value * 2;
    }
  });
```

After:
```js
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .component('myComponent', {
    bindings: {value: '<'},
    controller: function() {
      this.$onInit = function() {
        this.doubleValue = this.value * 2;
      };
    }
  });
```

If you don't have time to migrate the code at the moment, you can flip the
setting back to true:
```js
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .config(function($compileProvider) {
    $compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled(false);
  })
  .component('myComponent', {
    bindings: {value: '<'},
    controller: function() {
      this.doubleValue = this.value * 2;

Extension URIs (`resource://...`) bypass Content-Security-Policy in Chrome and
Firefox and can always be loaded. Now if a site already has a XSS bug, and uses
CSP to protect itself, but the user has an extension installed that uses
Angular, an attacked can load Angular from the extension, and Angular's
auto-bootstrapping can be used to bypass the victim site's CSP protection.

Notes:
- `isAutoBootstrapAllowed` must be initialized on load, so that `currentScript`
  is set correctly.
- The tests are a bit indirect as reproducing the actual scenario is too
  complicated to reproduce (requires signing an extension etc). I have confirmed
  this to be working manually.

In some cases IE11/Edge calls to `element.value` are very slow when the
`element.value` has not been set. Normally, these calls are usualy 0-3 ms
but in these cases it can take 200-300 ms. This can easily add 3 or more
seconds to the load time on a view that has 10 or more select tags using
`ngOptions`.

The line this pull request is changing not only suffers from the performance
issue described above but it also appears to be broken. The code is checking
that `option.value` does not equal `element.value` but then sets `element.value`
to `option.selectValue`.

I don't believe `option.value` is actually defined anywhere and likely it
was always intended to be `option.selectValue`. This means that check would
always be true and since this code has been this way for quite a while and
is causing a performance issue I've just removed the check. This way a call
to `element.value` is never made prior to it's value being set.

The `branchVersion` field is used to work out what version to use in the

until that version is on the Google CDN. Otherwise the docs app will break.

The `branchPattern` is used to determine what branch we are currently
working from and is generally used as a gate-keeper to prevent invalid
releases from the wrong branch.

The `getTaggedVersion()` method was using the `branchVersion` to check
that the tagged commit was valid but this fails when we are moving to a
new minor version with release candidates.

This fix avoids the problem by doing a custom comparison against the
`branchPattern` instead."

Previously, Angular tried to detect the CSS prefix the browser supports and
then use the saved one. This strategy is not ideal as currently some browsers
are supporting more than one vendor prefix. The best example is Microsoft Edge
that added -webkit- prefixes to be more Web-compatible; Firefox is doing
a similar thing on mobile. Some of the -webkit--prefixed things are now even
getting into specs to sanction that they're now required for Web compatibility.

In some cases Edge even supports only the -webkit--prefixed property; one
example is -webkit-appearance.

$sniffer.vendorPrefix is no longer used in Angular core outside of $sniffer
itself; taking that and the above problems into account, it's better to just
remove it. The only remaining use case was an internal use in detection of
support for transitions/animations but we can directly check the webkit prefix
there manually; no other prefix matters for them anyway.

$sniffer is undocumented API so this removal is not a breaking change. However,
if you've previously been using it in your code, just paste the following
to get the same function:

    var vendorPrefix = (function() {
      var prefix, prop, match;
      var vendorRegex = /^(Moz|webkit|ms)(?=[A-Z])/;
      for (prop in document.createElement('div').style) {
        if ((match = vendorRegex.exec(prop))) {
          prefix = match[0];
          break;
        }
      }
      return prefix;
    })();

The vendorPrefix variable will contain what $sniffer.vendorPrefix used to.

Note that we advise to not check for vendor prefixes this way; if you have to
do it, it's better to check it separately for each CSS property used for the
reasons described at the beginning. If you use jQuery, you don't have to do
anything; it automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS prefixes for you in
the .css() method.

This change aligns jqLite with jQuery 3.
The relevant bit of jQuery code is
https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/3.1.1/src/data/Data.js

Close #15126

BREAKING CHANGE: Previously, keys passed to the data method were left untouched.
Now they are internally camelCased similarly to how jQuery handles it, i.e.
only single (!) hyphens followed by a lowercase letter get converted to an
uppercase letter. This means keys `a-b` and `aB` represent the same data piece;
writing to one of them will also be reflected if you ask for the other one.

If you use Angular with jQuery, it already behaved in this way so no changes
are required on your part.

To migrate the code follow the examples below:

BEFORE:

/* 1 */
elem.data('my-key', 2);
elem.data('myKey', 3);

/* 2 */
elem.data('foo-bar', 42);
elem.data()['foo-bar']; // 42
elem.data()['fooBar']; // undefined

/* 3 */
elem.data()['foo-bar'] = 1;
elem.data()['fooBar'] = 2;
elem.data()['foo-bar']; // 1

AFTER:

/* 1 */
// Rename one of the keys as they would now map to the same data slot.
elem.data('my-key', 2);
elem.data('my-key2', 3);

/* 2 */
elem.data('foo-bar', 42);
elem.data()['foo-bar']; // undefined

jqLite needs camelCase for it's css method; it should only convert one dash
followed by a lowercase letter to an uppercase one; it shouldn't touch
underscores, colons or collapse multiple dashes into one. This is behavior
of jQuery 3 as well.

Also, jqLite's css camelCasing logic was put in a separate function and
refactored: now the properties starting from an uppercase letter are used by
default (i.e. Webkit, not webkit) and the only exception is for the -ms- prefix
that is converted to ms, not Ms. This makes the logic clearer as we're just
always changing a dash followed by a lowercase letter by an uppercase one; this
is also how it works in jQuery.

The camelCasing for the $compile and $sce services retains the previous behaviour.

Ref #15126
Fix #7744

BREAKING CHANGE: before, when Angular was used without jQuery, the key passed
to the css method was more heavily camelCased; now only a single (!) hyphen
followed by a lowercase letter is getting transformed. This also affects APIs
that rely on the css method, like ngStyle.

If you use Angular with jQuery, it already behaved in this way so no changes
are needed on your part.

BREAKING CHANGE: Previously, all boolean attributes were reflected into
properties in a setter and from a property in a getter, even on elements that
don't treat those attributes in a special way. Now Angular doesn't do it
by itself but relies on browsers to know when to reflect the property. Note that
this browser-level conversions differs between browsers; if you need to change
dynamic state of an element you should modify the property, not the attribute.

Change synchronous validators to convert the return to boolean value.

Closes #14734
Closes #15208

BREAKING CHANGE: Previously, only a literal `false` return would resolve as the
synchronous validator failing. Now, all traditionally false JavaScript values
are treated as failing the validator, as one would naturally expect.

Specifically, the values `0` (the number zero), `null`, `NaN` and `''` (the
empty string) used to considered valid (passing) and they are now considered
invalid (failing). The value `undefined` was treated similarly to a pending
asynchronous validator, causing the validation to be pending. `undefined` is
also now considered invalid.

To migrate, make sure your synchronous validators are returning either a
literal `true` or a literal `false` value. For most code, we expect this to
already be the case. Only a very small subset of projects will be affected.

Namely, anyone using `undefined` or any falsy value as a return will now see
their validation failing, whereas previously falsy values other than `undefined`
would have been seen as passing and `undefined` would have been seen as pending."

After:

```js
$http(...).
  then(function onSuccess(response) {
    // Handle success
    var data = response.data;
    var status = response.status;
    var statusText = response.statusText;
    var headers = response.headers;
    var config = response.config;
    ...
  }, function onError(response) {
    // Handle error
    var data = response.data;
    var status = response.status;
    var statusText = response.statusText;
    var headers = response.headers;
    var config = response.config;
    ...
  });

// or

$http(...).
  then(function onSuccess(response) {
    // Handle success
    var data = response.data;
    var status = response.status;
    var statusText = response.statusText;
    var headers = response.headers;
    var config = response.config;
    ...
  }).
  catch(function onError(response) {
    // Handle error

    var status = response.status;
    var statusText = response.statusText;
    var headers = response.headers;
    var config = response.config;
    ...
  });
```

**Note:**
There is a subtle difference between the variations showed above. When using
`$http(...).success(onSuccess).error(onError)` or `$http(...).then(onSuccess, onError)`, the
`onError()` callback will only handle errors/rejections produced by the `$http()` call. If the
`onSuccess()` callback produces an error/rejection, it won't be handled by `onError()` and might go
unnoticed. In contrast, when using `$http(...).then(onSuccess).catch(onError)`, `onError()` will
handle errors/rejections produced by both `$http()` _and_ `onSuccess()`."

The query parameter that will be used to transmit the JSONP callback to the
server is now specified via the `jsonpCallbackParam` config value, instead of
using the `JSON_CALLBACK` placeholder.

* Any use of `JSON_CALLBACK` in a JSONP request URL will cause an error.
* Any request that provides a parameter with the same name as that given
by the `jsonpCallbackParam` config property will cause an error.

This is to prevent malicious attack via the response from an app inadvertently
allowing untrusted data to be used to generate the callback parameter.

Closes #15161
Closes #15143
Closes #11352

BREAKING CHANGE

You can no longer use the `JSON_CALLBACK` placeholder in your JSONP requests.
Instead you must provide the name of the query parameter that will pass the
callback via the `jsonpCallbackParam` property of the config object, or app-wide via
the `$http.defaults.jsonpCallbackParam` property, which is `""callback""` by default.

Before this change:

```
$http.json('trusted/url?callback=JSON_CALLBACK');
$http.json('other/trusted/url', {params:cb:'JSON_CALLBACK'});

The $http service will reject JSONP requests that are not trusted by
`$sce` as ""ResourceUrl"".
This change makes is easier for developers to see clearly where in their
code they are making JSONP calls that may be to untrusted endpoings and
forces them to think about how these URLs are generated.

Be aware that this commit does not put any constraint on the parameters
that will be appended to the URL. Developers should be mindful of what
parameters can be attached and how they are generated.

Closes #11352

BREAKING CHANGE

All JSONP requests now require the URL to be trusted as resource URLs.
There are two approaches to trust a URL:

**Whitelisting with the `$sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist()`
method.**

You configure this list in a module configuration block:

```
appModule.config(['$sceDelegateProvider', function($sceDelegateProvider) {
  $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhiteList([
    // Allow same origin resource loads.
    'self',
    // Allow JSONP calls that match this pattern
    'https://some.dataserver.com/**.jsonp?**`
  ]);
}]);
```

**Explicitly trusting the URL via the `$sce.trustAsResourceUrl(url)`
method**

You can pass a trusted object instead of a string as a URL to the `$http`
service:

```
var promise = $http.jsonp($sce.trustAsResourceUrl(url));
```"

Previously, errors thrown in a promise's `onFulfilled` or `onRejected` handlers were treated in a
slightly different manner than regular rejections:
They were passed to the `$exceptionHandler()` (in addition to being converted to rejections).

The reasoning for this behavior was that an uncaught error is different than a regular rejection, as
it can be caused by a programming error, for example. In practice, this turned out to be confusing
or undesirable for users, since neither native promises nor any other popular promise library
distinguishes thrown errors from regular rejections.
(Note: While this behavior does not go against the Promises/A+ spec, it is not prescribed either.)

This commit removes the distinction, by skipping the call to `$exceptionHandler()`, thus treating
thrown errors as regular rejections.

**Note:**
Unless explicitly turned off, possibly unhandled rejections will still be caught and passed to the
`$exceptionHandler()`, so errors thrown due to programming errors and not otherwise handled (with a
subsequent `onRejected` handler) will not go unnoticed.

Fixes #3174
Fixes #14745

Closes #15213

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, throwing an error from a promise's `onFulfilled` or `onRejection` handlers, would result
in passing the error to the `$exceptionHandler()` (in addition to rejecting the promise with the
error as reason).

Now, a thrown error is treated exactly the same as a regular rejection. This applies to all
services/controllers/filters etc that rely on `$q` (including built-in services, such as `$http` and
`$route`). For example, `$http`'s `transformRequest/Response` functions or a route's `redirectTo`
function as well as functions specified in a route's `resolve` object, will no longer result in a
call to `$exceptionHandler()` if they throw an error. Other than that, everything will continue to
behave in the same way; i.e. the promises will be rejected, route transition will be cancelled,
`$routeChangeError` events will be broadcasted etc."

The angular expression parser (`$parse`) attempts to sandbox expressions
to prevent unrestricted access to the global context.

While the sandbox was not on the frontline of the security defense,
developers kept relying upon it as a security feature even though it was
always possible to access arbitrary JavaScript code if a malicious user
could control the content of Angular templates in applications.

This commit removes this sandbox, which has the following benefits:

* it sends a clear message to developers that they should not rely on
the sandbox to prevent XSS attacks; that they must prevent control of
expression and templates instead.
* it allows performance and size improvements in the core Angular 1
library.
* it simplifies maintenance and provides opportunities to make the
parser more capable.

Previously, due to their differences from normal CPAs, `$sniffer` would fail to
detect sandboxed CPAs and incorrectly assume `history.pushState` is available
(which resulted in an error being thrown).
This commit fixes the detection of sandboxed CPAs in `$sniffer`.

See #11932 and #13945 for previous work.

Previously, you had to apply the complete set of ngModelOptions at every point where
you might want to modify just one or two settings.

This change allows more general settings to be applied nearer to the top of the DOM
and then for more specific settings to override those general settings further down
in the DOM.

Furher there is now a new service `$modelOptions` that acts as the top level options
that are inherited by all ngModelOptions directives that do not already have an
ngModelOptions ancestor directive.

Closes #10922

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, if a setting was not applied on ngModelOptions, then it would default
to undefined. Now the setting will be inherited from the nearest ngModelOptions
ancestor.

It is possible that an ngModelOptions directive that does not set a property,
has an ancestor ngModelOptions that does set this property to a value other than
undefined. This would cause the ngModel and input controls below this ngModelOptions
directive to display different behaviour. This is fixed by explictly setting the
property in the ngModelOptions to prevent it from inheriting from the ancestor.

For example if you had the following HTML:

```
<form ng-model-options=""{updateOn: 'blur'}"">
  <input ng-model=""..."">
</form>
```

Then before this change the input would update on the default event not blur.
After this change the input will inherit the option to update on blur.
If you want the original behaviour then you will need to specify the option
on the input as well:

```
<form ng-model-options=""{updateOn: 'blur'}"">
  <input ng-model=""..."" ng-model-options=""{updateOn: 'default'}"">
</form>
```

The programmatic API for `ngModelOptions` has changed. You must now read options
via the `getOption` method, rather than accessing the option directly as a property
of the options object. This does not affect the usage in templates and only
affects custom directives that might have been reading options for their own purposes."

- when the model does not match any option, the select generates an unknown option with the value
'? hashedModelVal ?' (select) or simply '?' (ngOptions) and inserts it into the select. This
option is then auto-selected by the browser. Once the user selects an option / the application sets
a matching model, the unknown option is removed from the select. It is therefore not user-selectable.

Alternatively, the application can provide an option with the value='', the so-called empty option.
The empty option takes over the role of the unknown option, in that it is selected when there's no
matching model, but it is not removed when a option and model match, and it can also be selected by
the user. The empty option has the value='' and sets the model to  if selected.

Previously, these concepts where a bit mushy, especially in ngOptions.

This fix now delegates the bulk of the work to the selectCtrl, as the concept of unknown and empty
option are the same for both directives. Only the generation of the empty option is different.

The commit also adjusts a test for an officially unsupported use-case: multiple empty options.
The new behavior is that the empty option that is registered last is used. The other one is still
present. Otherwise, this behavior is unspecified, and the docs are clear that only a single empty
option is allowed. We support dynamically generated empty options, but not multiple ones. I've left
the test to highlight that this might be someone's use case, and the we are aware of it."

As explained in #11781 and #14924, IE11 can (under certain circumstances) break up a text node into
multiple consecutive ones, breaking interpolated expressions (e.g. `{{'foo'}}` would become
`{{` + `'foo'}}`). To work-around this IE11 bug, #11796 introduced extra logic to merge consecutive
text nodes (on IE11 only), which relies on the text nodes' having the same `parentNode`.

This approach works fine in the common case, where `compileNodes` is called with a live NodeList
object, because removing a text node from its parent will automatically update the latter's
`.childNodes` NodeList. It falls short though, when calling `compileNodes` with either a
jqLite/jQuery collection or an Array. In fails in two ways:

1. If the text nodes do not have a parent at the moment of compiling, there will be no merging.
   (This happens for example on directives with `transclude: {...}`.)
2. If the text nodes do have a parent, just removing a text node from its parent does **not** remove
   it from the collection/array, which means that the merged text nodes will still get compiled and
   linked (and possibly be displayed in the view). E.g. `['{{text1}}', '{{text2}}', '{{text3}}']`
   will become `['{{text1}}{{text2}}{{text3}}', '{{text2}}', '{{text3}}']`.

--
This commit works around the above problems by:

1. Merging consecutive text nodes in the provided list, even if they have no parent.
2. When merging a text node, explicitly remove it from the list (unless it is a live, auto-updating
   list).

This can nonetheless have undesirable (albeit rare) side effects by overzealously merging text
nodes that are not meant to be merged (see the ""BREAKING CHANGE"" section below).

Fixes #14924

Closes #15025

BREAKING CHANGE:

**Note:** Everything described below affects **IE11 only**.

Previously, consecutive text nodes would not get merged if they had no parent. They will now, which
might have unexpectd side effects in the following cases:

1. Passing an array or jqLite/jQuery collection of parent-less text nodes to `$compile` directly:

    ```js
    // Assuming:
    var textNodes = [
      document.createTextNode('{{'),
      document.createTextNode('""foo""'),
      document.createTextNode('}}')
    ];
    var compiledNodes = $compile(textNodes)($rootScope);

    // Before:
    console.log(compiledNodes.length);   // 3
    console.log(compiledNodes.text());   // {{'foo'}}

    // After:
    console.log(compiledNodes.length);   // 1
    console.log(compiledNodes.text());   // foo

    // To get the old behavior, compile each node separately:
    var textNodes = [
      document.createTextNode('{{'),
      document.createTextNode('""foo""'),
      document.createTextNode('}}')
    ];
    var compiledNodes = angular.element(textNodes.map(function (node) {
      return $compile(node)($rootScope)[0];
    }));
    ```

2. Using multi-slot transclusion with non-consecutive, default-content text nodes (that form
   interpolated expressions when merged):

   ```js
   // Assuming the following component:
   .compoent('someThing', {
     template: '<ng-transclude><!-- Default content goes here --></ng-transclude>'
     transclude: {
       ignored: 'veryImportantContent'
     }
   })
   ```

   ```html
   <!-- And assuming the following view: -->
   <some-thing>
     {{
     <very-important-content>Nooot</very-important-content>
     'foo'}}
   </some-thing>

   <!-- Before: -->
   <some-thing>
     <ng-transclude>
       {{       <-- Two separate
       'foo'}}  <-- text nodes
     </ng-transclude>
   </some-thing>

   <!-- After: -->
   <some-thing>
     <ng-transclude>
       foo  <-- The text nodes were merged into `{{'foo'}}`, which was then interpolated
     </ng-transclude>
   </some-thing>

   <!-- To (visually) get the old behavior, wrap top-level text nodes on -->
   <!-- multi-slot transclusion directives into `<span>` elements; e.g.: -->
   <some-thing>
     <span>{{</span>
     <very-important-content>Nooot</very-important-content>
     <span>'foo'}}</span>
   </some-thing>

   <!-- Result: -->
   <some-thing>
     <ng-transclude>
       <span>{{</span>       <-- Two separate
       <span>'foo'}}</span>  <-- nodes
     </ng-transclude>

In HTML5 mode, links can now be selectively rewritten, by setting `mode.rewriteLinks` to a string
(denoting an attribute name). Anchor elements that have the specified attribute will be rewritten,
while other links will remain untouched.

This can be useful in situations where it is desirable to use HTML5 mode without a `<base>` tag, but
still support rewriting specific links only. See #14959 for more details on a possible usecase.

This commit fixes the handling of min/max, and removes support for ngMin/ngMax:

min/max:
Previously, interpolated min/max values on input range were not set when the first $render happens,
because the interpolation directive only sets the actual element attribute value after
a digest passes. That means that the browser would not adjust
the input value according to min/max and the range input and model would
not be initialzed as expected. 
With this change, input range will set the actual element attribute value during its own
linking phase, as it is already available on the attrs argument passed to the link fn.

ngMin/ngMax
Since ng prefixed attributes do not set their corresponding element attribute, the range input would always have min = 0, and max = 100 (in supported browsers), regardless of the value
in ngMin/ngMax. This is confusing and not very useful, so it's better to not support these attributes at all.

The commit also fixes a test which used an interpolation inside an attribute that expects an expression.

Input elements use the value attribute as their default value if the value property is not set.

makes it possible to use ngValue as a one-way bind.

Closes #14031
Closes #13984

POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGE:

`ngValue` now also sets the value *property* of its element. Previously, it would only set the
value *attribute*. This allows `ngValue` to be used as a one-way binding mechanism on `input[text]`
and `textarea` elements without `ngModel`. Previously, these input types would not update correctly
when only the value attribute was changed.
This change should not affect any applications, as `ngValue` is mainly used on `input[radio]` and
`option` elements, both of which are unaffected by this change."

When using the [timeout attribute](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#the-timeout-attribute) and an XHR
request times out, browsers trigger the `timeout` event (and execute the XHR's `ontimeout`
callback). Additionally, Safari 9 handles timed-out requests in the same way, even if no `timeout`
has been explicitly set on the XHR.
In the above cases, `$httpBackend` would fail to capture the XHR's completing (with an error), so
the corresponding `$http` promise would never get fulfilled.

Note that using `$http`'s `timeout` configuration option does **not** rely on the XHR's `timeout`
property (or its `ontimeout` callback).

Previously, `ngAria` would overwrite the default `ngModelController.$isEmpty()` method for custom
`checkbox`-shaped controls (e.g. `role=""checkbox""` or `role=""menuitemcheckbox""`), using the same
implementation as `input[checkbox]` (i.e. `value === false`). While this makes sense for
`input[checkbox]` which also defines a custom parser, it doesn't make sense for a custom `checkbox`
out-of-the-box. For example, an unintialized value (`undefined`) would make the checkbox appear as
""checked"".

If the user wants to provide a custom parser (e.g. setting falsy values to `false`), then they
should also provide a custom `$isEmpty()` method.

As a side effect, this commit solves issue #14621. (We could have solved it in different ways.)

Fixes #14621
Closes #14625

BREAKING CHANGE:

Custom `checkbox`-shaped controls (e.g. checkboxes, menuitemcheckboxes), no longer have a custom
`$isEmpty()` method on their `NgModelController` that checks for `value === false`. Unless
overwritten, the default `$isEmpty()` method will be used, which treats `undefined`, `null`, `NaN`
and `''` as ""empty"".

**Note:** The `$isEmpty()` method is used to determine if the checkbox is checked (""not empty"" means
          ""checked"") and thus it can indirectly affect other things, such as the control's validity
          with respect to the `required` validator (e.g. ""empty"" + ""required"" --> ""invalid"").

Before:

```js
var template = '<my-checkbox role=""checkbox"" ng-model=""value""></my-checkbox>';
var customCheckbox = $compile(template)(scope);
var ctrl = customCheckbox.controller('ngModel');

scope.$apply('value = false');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> true

scope.$apply('value = true');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false

scope.$apply('value = undefined'/* or null or NaN or '' */);
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false
```

After:

```js
var template = '<my-checkbox role=""checkbox"" ng-model=""value""></my-checkbox>';
var customCheckbox = $compile(template)(scope);
var ctrl = customCheckbox.controller('ngModel');

scope.$apply('value = false');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false

scope.$apply('value = true');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false

scope.$apply('value = undefined'/* or null or NaN or '' */);
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> true
```

--
If you want to have a custom `$isEmpty()` method, you need to overwrite the default. For example:

```js
.directive('myCheckbox', function myCheckboxDirective() {
  return {
    require: 'ngModel',
    link: function myCheckboxPostLink(scope, elem, attrs, ngModelCtrl) {
      ngModelCtrl.$isEmpty = function myCheckboxIsEmpty(value) {
        return !value;   // Any falsy value means ""empty""

        // Or to restore the previous behavior:
        // return value === false;
      };
    }
  };
})
```"

Thanks to @cironunes for the initial implementation in https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/9715

Adds support for binding to input[range] with the following behavior / features:

- Like input[number], it requires the model to be a Number, and will set the model to a Number
- it supports setting the min/max values via the min/max and ngMin/ngMax attributes
- it follows the browser behavior of never allowing an invalid value. That means, when the browser
converts an invalid value (empty: null, undefined, false ..., out of bounds: greater than max, less than min)
to a valid value, the input will in turn set the model to this new valid value via $setViewValue.
-- this means a range input will never be required and never have a non-Number model value, once the
ngModel directive is initialized.
-- this behavior is supported when the model changes and when the min/max attributes change in a way
that prompts the browser to update the input value.
-- ngMin / ngMax do not prompt the browser to update the values, as they don't set the attribute values.
Instead, they will set the min / max errors when appropriate
- browsers that do not support input[range] (IE9) handle the input like a number input (with validation etc.)

When the select model changes, we add the ""selected"" attribute to the selected option, so that
screen readers know which option is selected.

Previously, we failed to remove the attribute from the selected / empty option when the model changed
to match a different option, or the unknown / empty option.

When using ""track by"", the behavior would also show when a user selected an option, and then the
model was changed, because track by watches the tracked expression, and calls the $render function
on change.

This fix reads the current select value, finds the matching option and removes the ""selected""
attribute.

IE9 had to be special cased, as it will report option.hasAttribute('selected') === true even
if the option's property and attribute have been unset (even the dev tools show not selected attribute).

I've added a custom matcher that accounts for this behavior. In all other browsers, property and
attribute should always be in the same state. Since few people will use screen readers with IE9, I
hope this is a satisfactory solution to the problem.

During its linking phase, `ngView` relies on the info provided in `$route.current` for
instantiating the initial view. `$route.current` is set in the callback of a listener to
`$locationChangeSuccess`, which is registered during the instantiation of the `$route` service.

Thus, it is crucial that the `$route` service is instantiated _before_ the initial
`$locationChangeSuccess` event is fired. Since `ngView` declares `$route` as a dependency, the
service is instantiated in time, if `ngView` is present during the initial load of the page.

Yet, in cases where `ngView` is included in a template that is loaded asynchronously (e.g. in
another directive's template), the directive factory might not be called soon enough for `$route`
to be instantiated before the initial `$locationChangeSuccess` event is fired.

This commit fixes it, by enabling eager instantiation of `$route` (during the initialization phase).
Eager instantiation can be disabled (restoring the old behavior), but is on by default.

Fixes #1213
Closes #14893

BREAKING CHANGE:

In cases where `ngView` was loaded asynchronously, `$route` (and its dependencies; e.g. `$location`)
might also have been instantiated asynchronously. After this change, `$route` (and its dependencies)
will - by default - be instantiated early on.

Although this is not expected to have unwanted side-effects in normal application bebavior, it may
affect your unit tests: When testing a module that (directly or indirectly) depends on `ngRoute`, a
request will be made for the default route's template. If not properly ""trained"", `$httpBackend`
will complain about this unexpected request.

You can restore the previous behavior (and avoid unexpected requests in tests), by using
`$routeProvider.eagerInstantiationEnabled(false)`."

Calling `$http` will not increment `$browser.outstandingRequestCount` until after all (potentially)
asynchronous request interceptors have been processed and will decrement it before any (potentially)
asynchronous response interceptors have been processed.
This can lead to `$browser.notifyWhenNoOutstandingRequests` firing
prematurely, which can be problematic in end-to-end tests.

This commit fixes this, by synchronizing the increment/decrement
operations with `$http`'s internal interceptor promise chain.

BREAKING CHANGE:

HTTP requests now update the outstanding request count synchronously.
Previously the request count would not have been updated until the
request to the server is actually in flight. Now the request count is
updated before the async interceptor is called.

The new behaviour is correct but it may change the expected behaviour in
a small number of e2e test cases where an async request interceptor is
being used."

Firing a digest at the beginning of the verification process, ensures that requests fired
asynchronously - e.g. in the `resolve` handler of a promise as happens with `$http` - will get
detected as well.
Previously, in order to reliably verify that there was no outstanding request, users needed to
manually trigger a digest, before calling `verifyNoOutstandingRequest()`. Failing to do so, could
prevent `verifyNoOutstandingRequest()` from detecting pending requests and cover bugs in application
code.
This is no longer the case, since a digest will always be fired autommatically as part of a call to
`verifyNoOutstandingRequest()`.

Fixes #13506
Closes #13513

BREAKING CHANGE:

Calling `$httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingRequest()` will trigger a digest. This will ensure that
requests fired asynchronously will also be detected (without the need to manually trigger a digest).
This is not expected to affect the majority of test-suites. Most of the time, a digest is (directly
or indirectly) triggered anyway, before calling `verifyNoOutstandingRequest()`.
In the unlikely case that a test needs to verify the timing of a request with respect to the digest
cycle, you should rely on other means, such as mocking and/or spying."

When option elements use ngValue, value or interpolated text to set
the option value, i.e. when the parent select doesn't have an ngModel,
there is no necessity in registering the options with the select controller.

The registration was usually not a problem, as the ngModelController is set to a noop controller,
so that all further interactions are aborted ($render etc)

However, since f02b707 ngValue sets a hashed value inside the option value
(to support arbitrary value types). This can cause issues with tests that expect unhashed values.
The issue was found in angular-material, which uses select + ngValue to populate mdSelect.

POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGE:

Option elements will no longer set their value attribute from their text value when their select
element has no ngModel associated. Setting the value is only needed for the select directive to
match model values and options. If no ngModel is present, the select directive doesn't need it.

This should not affect many applications as the behavior was undocumented and not part of a public
API. It also has no effect on the usual HTML5 behavior that sets the select value to the option text
if the option does not provide a value attribute.

Previously, `ngAria` would provide keyboard support for non-native buttons (via `ngClick`), by
binding the `ngClick` handler to the `keypress` event. In an attempt to better emulate the behavior
of native buttons, `ngAria` will now bind to the `keydown` event (instead of `keypress`).

The configuration flag for this feature has been renamed from `bindKeypress` to `bindKeydown`, to
closer describe the underlying behavior.

Fixes #14063
Closes #14065

BREAKING CHANGE:

If you were explicitly setting the value of the `bindKeypress` flag, you need to change your code to
use `bindKeydown` instead.

Before: `$ariaProvider.config({bindKeypress: xyz})`
After: `$ariaProvider.config({bindKeydown: xyz})`

**Note:**
If the element already has any of the `ngKeydown`/`ngKeyup`/`ngKeypress` directives, `ngAria` will
_not_ bind to the `keydown` event, since it assumes that the developer has already taken care of
keyboard interaction for that element.

Although it is not expected to affect many applications, it might be desirable to keep the previous
behavior of binding to the `keypress` event instead of the `keydown`. In that case, you need to
manually use the `ngKeypress` directive (in addition to `ngClick`).

Before:

```html
<div ng-click=""onClick()"">
  I respond to `click` and `keypress` (not `keydown`)
</div>
```

After:

```html
<div ng-click=""onClick()"" ng-keypress=""onClick()"">
  I respond to `click` and `keypress` (not `keydown`)
</div>
<!-- OR -->
<div ng-click=""onClick()"">
  I respond to `click` and `keydown` (not `keypress`)
</div>
```

Finally, it is possible that this change affects your unit or end-to-end tests. If you are currently
expecting your custom buttons to automatically respond to the `keypress` event (due to `ngAria`),
you need to change the tests to trigger `keydown` events instead."

select elements with ngModel will now set ngModel to option values added by ngValue.
This allows setting values of any type (not only strings) without the use of ngOptions.

Interpolations inside attributes can only be strings, but the ngValue directive uses attrs.$set,
which does not have any type restriction. Any $observe on the value attribute will therefore receive
the original value (result of ngValue expression). However, when a user selects an option, the browser
sets the select value to the actual option's value attribute, which is still always a string.
For that reason, when options are added by ngValue, we set the hashed value of the original value in
the value attribute and store the actual value in an extra map. When the select value changes, we
read access the actual value via the hashed select value.

Since we only use a hashed value for ngValue, we will have extra checks for the hashed values:
- when options are read, for both single and multiple select
- when options are written, for multiple select

I don't expect this to have a performance impact, but it should be kept in mind.

Closes #9842
Closes #6297

BREAKING CHANGE:

`<option>` elements added to `<select ng-model>` via `ngValue` now add their values in hash form, i.e.
`<option ng-value=""myString"">` becomes `<option ng-value=""myString"" value=""string:myString"">`.

This is done to support binding options with values of any type to selects.

This should rarely affect applications, as the values of options are usually not relevant to the
application logic, but it's possible that option values are checked in tests."

```html
<!-- Before: -->
<span ng-bind=""myCustomObject"">[object Object]</span>

<!-- After: -->
<span ng-bind=""myCustomObject"">a+b</span>

If you want the output of `toString()`, you can use it directly on the value in ngBind:

Also affects the reverse case, adding a class that is scheduled to be removed with rAF.

The following case can happen when ngClass updates an element's classes in very quick order in the following way:

- First animation adds class ""a""
- A digest passes, but ""a"" is not yet added to the element
- Second animation adds class ""b""
- No digest passes, and ""a"" is still not added to the element,
  because requestAnimationFrame hasn't been flushed yet
- Third animation removes class ""a""
- the third animation gets merged into the second animation

Before this change:

- Because the element doesn't have class ""a"" yet, ngAnimate
resolves that it cannot remove class ""a"". However,
the first animation is still running, and finally adds ""a""

After this change:

- ngAnimate reacts to the temporary class ""add-a"", which indicates
that ""a"" is about to be added and decides that ""a"" can be removed
after all.

This is a very rare case where setting the element's class
is not fast enough, and subsequent animations operate on incorrect assumptions.

""In the wild"", this is caused by rapidly updating ngClass,
which uses inidvidual addClass and removeClass calls when both operations happen in a single digest.

`resolveRedirectTo` can be set to a function that will (eventually) return the new URL to redirect
to. The function supports dependency injection and should return the new URL either as a string or
as a promise that will be resolved to a string.

If the `resolveRedirectTo` function returns `undefined` or returns a promise that gets resolved to
`undefined`, no redirection will take place and the current route will be processed normally.

If the `resolveRedirectTo` function throws an error or the returned promise gets rejected, no
further processing will take place (e.g. no template fetched, no `resolve` functions run, no
controller instantiated) and a `$routeChangeError` will be broadcasted.

`redirectTo` takes precedence over `resolveRedirectTo`, so specifying both on the same route
definition, will cause the latter to be ignored.

**Limit size of local-part and total path size in eMail addresses**

RFC 5321 §4.5.3.1.1 ⇒ local-part can have up to 64 octets
RFC 5321 §4.5.3.1.3 ⇒ path “including the punctuation and
element separators” can have up to 256 octets
RFC 5321 §4.1.2 specifies path as ‘<’ + mailbox¹ + ‘>’ in
the best case, leaving us 254 octets

The limitation of the total path size to 254 octets leaves
at most 252 octets (one local-part, one ‘@’) for the domain,
which means we don’t need to explicitly check the domain
size any more (removing the assertion after the ‘@’).

① RFC 821/5321 “mailbox” is the same as RFC 822 “addr-spec”

**Optimise eMail address regex for speed**

There is no need to make it case-insensitive; the local-part
already catches the entire range, and the host part is easily
done. Furthermore, this makes the regex locale-independent,
avoiding issues with e.g. turkish case conversions.

cf. http://www.mirbsd.org/cvs.cgi/contrib/hosted/tg/mailfrom.php?rev=HEAD

**Limit eMail address total host part length**

RFC 1035 §2.3.4 imposes a maximum length for any DNS object;
RFC 5321 §2.3.5 references this (and requires FQDNs, but there
have been cases where a TLD had an MX RR and thus eMail addresses
like “localpart@tld” are valid).

**Limit eMail address individual host part length**

A “label” (each of the things between the dots (‘.’) after the ‘@’ in
the eMail address) MUST NOT be longer than 63 characters.

This allows developers to use white-space in their attributes, for example as value for
input[type=radio], as a separator in ngList, or as a value in any custom directive binding.
It's also consistent with the HTML spec, which allows white-space in attributes, and consistent
with Angular2, which also allows white-space in attributes.

Fixes #5513
Fixes #14539
Closes #5597

BREAKING CHANGE:

White-space in attributes is no longer trimmed automatically. This includes leading and trailing
white-space, and attributes that are purely white-space.

To migrate, attributes that require trimming must now be trimmed manually.

A common cases where stray white-space can cause problems is when
attribute values are compared, for example in an $observer:

Before:
```
$attrs.$observe('myAttr', function(newVal) {
  if (newVal === 'false') ...
});
```

To migrate, the attribute value should be trimmed manually:
```
$attrs.$observe('myAttr', function(newVal) {
  if (newVal.trim() === 'false') ...
});
```

Note that `$parse` trims expressions automatically, so attributes with expressions (e.g. directive
bindings) are unlikely to be affected by stray white-space."

The decorated version of `$controller` is able to assign bindings to a controller instance prior to
instantiation, emulating the behavior of `$compile` with directive controllers.

There are cases, that the actual controller instance is different than the pre-populated one (e.g.
when the controller constructor function returns a value or when the controller is an ES2015 Class).
While `$compile` accounts for such situation, by re-asigning the bindings after the controller has
been instantiated, `ngMock`'s `$controller` didn't.

This commit fixes it, by re-applying the bindings if the actual controller instance is different
than the original one (similar to how `$compile` would do it).

In the Chrome issue (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=381459)
I noticed that the bug can't be reproduced in Chrome 45 and the issue was
closed subsequently. I've also tested again with Chrome 51 and it still works.

Additionally, the Chrome hack was kept in the select code, but wasn't ported to
the ngOptions code when the two split in 7fda214c4f65a6a06b25cf5d5aff013a364e9cef,
and no regression happened.

Nevertheless, a test has been added to guard against a future regression.

If a route defines a `redirectTo` value, the current route should stop processing the route
and instead wait to process the route of the redirect.

Currently, what is happening is that Angular detects a redirectTo value and updates $location,
but then continues processing the route that was intended to be redirected.
Templates are loaded, resolves are processed, ng-view then updates the view with a new template
and instantiates the controller all for a route that should have been redirected.

A common use case for assigning a function to the redirectTo is to validation authentication,
permission check, or some other logic to determine if the route should continue or redirect
else where. In the end, this happens, but in between, unexpected results may occur by updating
the view and instantiating controllers for logic that wasn't expected to be executed.

http://plnkr.co/edit/8QlA0ouuePH3p35Ntmjy?p=preview

This commit checks for a url change after a potential redirect, it the url changed, and is
not `null` nor `undefined`, exit out and don't process current route change.

Closes #3332
Closes #14658

BREAKING CHANGE

The $route service no longer instantiates controllers nor calls resolves or template functions
for routes that have a `redirectTo` unless the `redirectTo` is a function that returns
`undefined`."

`module.decorator` is now processed via the configBlocks order of operations and:
  1. no longer throws error if declared before the provider being decorated.
  2. guarantees the correct provider will be decorated when multiple, same-name
  providers are defined.

(1) Prior to this fix, declaring `module.decorator` before the provider that it
decorates results in throwing an error:

```js
angular
  .module('theApp', [])
  .decorator('theFactory', moduleDecoratorFn)
  .factory('theFactory', theFactoryFn);

// Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module theApp due to:
// Error: [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: theFactoryProvider
```

The result of this fix now allows for the declaration order above.

(2) Prior to this fix, declaring `module.decorator` before the final, same-named
provider results in that provider **not** being decorated as expected:

**NOTE:** Angular does not use provider name spacing, so the final declared
provider is selected if multiple, same-named providers are declared.

```js
angular
  .module('theApp', [])
  .factory('theFactory', theFactoryFn)
  .decorator('theFactory', moduleDecoratorFn)
  .factory('theFactory', theOtherFactoryFn);
```

`theOtherFactoryFn` is selected as 'theFactory' provider, but prior to this fix it is **not**
decorated via `moduleDecoratorFn`. This fix ensures that `theOtherFactoryFn` will be decorated as
expected when using the declaration order above.

Closes #12382
Closes #14348

BREAKING CHANGE:

`module.decorator` declarations are now processed as part of the `module.config`
queue and may result in providers being decorated in a different order if
`module.config` blocks are also used to decorate providers via
`$provide.decorator`.

For example, consider the following declaration order in which 'theFactory' is
decorated by both a `module.decorator` and a `$provide.decorator`:

```js
angular
  .module('theApp', [])
  .factory('theFactory', theFactoryFn)
  .config(function($provide) {
    $provide.decorator('theFactory', provideDecoratorFn);
  })
  .decorator('theFactory', moduleDecoratorFn);
```

Prior to this fix, 'theFactory' provider would be decorated in the following
order:
  1. moduleDecoratorFn
  2. provideDecoratorFn

The result of this fix changes the order in which 'theFactory' is decorated
because now `module.decorator` declarations are processed in the same order as
`module.config` declarations:
  1. provideDecoratorFn
  2. moduleDecoratorFn"

This is a major re-structuring of the tutorial app's codebase, aiming at applying established best
practices (in terms of file naming/layout and code organization) and utilizing several new features
and enhancements (most notably components) introduced in recent versions of Angular (especially
v1.5).

Apart from the overall changes, two new chapters were introduced: one on components and one on code
organization.

--
In the process, several other things were (incidentally) taken care of, including:

* Dependencies were upgraded to latest versions.
* Animations were polished.
* Outdated links were updated.
* The app's base URL was changed to `/` (instead of `/app/`).

BTW, this has been tested with the following versions of Node (on Windows 10) and everything worked
fine:

* 0.11.16
* 4.2.6
* 4.4.2
* 5.10.0
* 6.2.0

--
This was inspired by (and loosely based on) #13834.
Again, mad props to @teropa for leading the way :)

--
**Note:**
The old version of the tutorial, that is compatible with Angular version 1.4 or older, has been
saved on the `pre-v1.5.0-snapshot` branch of
[angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat). The `v1.4.x` version of the
tutorial should be pointed to that branch instead of `master`.

While $location expects that $browser stores the URL unchanged, ""some browsers"" transform the URL

However, it failed to update pendingLocation in all code paths, causing
$browser.url() to sometimes incorrectly report previous URLs, which horribly confused $location.

When calling `.splice()` without a 2nd argument (`deleteCount`), most browsers will splice to the
end of the array. As it turns out, this is the behavior specified in [ES2015][es6]. In [ES5][es5],
the spec seems to imply that nothing should happen.

To avoid inconsistent behavior among browsers implementing different versions of the EcmaScript
standart or when ES5 shims are included (e.g. https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim/), this commit
ensures that all calls to `.splice()` provide at least two arguments.

This changes the way option elements are generated when the ngOption collection changes.
Previously, we would re-use option elements when possible (updating their text and
label). Now, we first remove all currently displayed options and the create new options for the
collection. The new options are first appended to a documentFragment, which is in the end appended
to the selectElement.

Using documentFragment improves render performance in IE with large option collections
(> 100 elements) considerably.

Creating new options from scratch fixes issues in IE where the select would become unresponsive
to user input.

Add support for collecting current stack trace information in browsers
(e.g. IE10+, PhantomJS) that do not automatically store the current stack trace
information in a newly created `Error` object's `stack` property, but
only add it there once the `Error` gets thrown.

The original implementation works fine in Firefox & Chrome, but fails on IE10+
and PhantomJS where it, for example, breaks Karma's error reporting in cases
when an exception is thrown in a test like the following:

```
it('the holy crusade', inject(function() {
  var x = {};
  x.holyGrail();
}));
```

In this case, the ngMock `inject()` implementation would incorrectly add the
word `undefined` at the end of the collected error stack trace information,
thus causing the main error description to be reported back to Karma as
`undefined`.

The added test makes sure this functionality:

- works as expected in browsers supporting JavaScript stack trace
  collection, e.g. Chrome, Firefox, IE10+, Opera & PhantomJS
- does not add any bogus stack track information in browsers that do
  not support JavaScript stack trace collection, e.g. IE9

BREAKING CHANGE:

the ""nodomevents"" error at compile time.
Previously the nodomevents was thrown at link time. The new behavior makes it consistent with

The fix for removing the event callbacks on destroy introduced in

This commit fixes the behavior so that the event callbacks are only removed during on('$destroy')
when no animation is currently active on the element. When an animation is active, the event callbacks
will be removed after all callbacks have run, and if the element has no parent (has been removed from
the DOM).

Since commit a3a7afd3aa70d981b0210088df53fa2cf68d3a3d, animations are not run

However, some libraries rely on the $animate.on() callbacks to be called even when no actual animation
runs.
This commit restores the behavior for the ngAnimate.$animate functions.
Note that callbacks still won't be called if animations are disabled, because this would be be a potential
breaking change, as some applications might rely on this implementation.

The previous behavior is inconsistent with both default HTML behavior and select with
ngModel but without ngOptions. Both allow disabled values to be selected programmatically.

A common use case for this behavior is an option that was previously valid, but has
been disabled, and cannot be selected again.

options are not set have been adjusted to the ensure the opposite.

This change adds in the following new lifecycle hooks, which map in some
way to those in Angular 2:

 * `$onChanges(changesObj)` - Called whenever one-way bindings are updated. The `changesObj` is a hash whose keys
   are the names of the bound properties that have changed, and the values are an object of the form
   `{ currentValue: ..., previousValue: ... }`. Use this hook to trigger updates within a component such as
   cloning the bound value to prevent accidental mutation of the outer value.
 * `$onDestroy` - Called on a controller when its containing scope is destroyed. Use this hook for releasing
   external resources, watches and event handlers.
 * `$postLink` - Called after this controller's element and its children been linked. Similar to the post-link
   function this hook can be used to set up DOM event handlers and do direct DOM manipulation.
   Note that child elements that contain `templateUrl` directives will not have been compiled and linked since
   they are waiting for their template to load asynchronously and their own compilation and linking has been
   suspended until that occurs.

When multiple animations on the same element are queued before a $digest passes,
the animator tries to create as few actual animations as possible by joining / canceling
redundant animations. Class-based animations for example are cancelled when the classes that
are added and removed are the same, and the result is no class-change. This however must only
happen if there's no structural animation currently queued.

Under specific circumstances, ngMessages would go into an infinite loop and crash the
browser / page:
- At least two ngMessage elements are wrapped inside another element (e.g. ngTransclude)
- The first message is currently visible
- The first message is removed (e.g. when the whole ngMessages element is removed by an ngIf)

When a message is removed, it looks for a previous message - in this specific case it would misidentify
the second message for a previous message, which would then cause the first message to be marked as the
second message's next message, resulting in an infinite loop, and crash.

This fix ensures that when searching for previous messages, ngMessage walks the DOM in a way so
that messages that come after the current message are never identified as previous messages.

This commit also detaches and destroys all child ngMessage elements when the ngMessages element is
destroyed, which should improve performance slightly.

This commit fixes it by detecting a Chrome Packaged App (through the presence of
`window.chrome.app.runtime`). Note that `window.chrome.app` is present in the context of ""normal""
webpages as well, but it doesn't have the `runtime` property, which is only available to packaged
apps (e.g. see https://developer.chrome.com/apps/api_index).

(It also also contains some style changes for making the structure and layout of `$sniffer` tests
 more consistent.)

The $location service is designed to support hash prefixed URLs
for cases where the browser does not support HTML5 push-state navigation.

The Google Ajax Crawling Scheme expects that local paths within a SPA start
with a hash-bang (e.g. `somedomain.com/base/path/#!/client/side/path`).

The `$locationProvide` allows the application developer to configure the
hashPrefix, and it is normal to set this to a bang '!', but the default
has always been the empty string ''.

This has caused some confusion where a user is not aware of this feature
and wonders why adding a hash value to the location (e.g. `$location.hash('xxx')`)
results in a double hash: `##xxx`.

This commit changes the default value of the prefix to '!', which is more
natural and expected.

See https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/getting-started

Closes #13812
Closes #14202

BREAKING CHANGE

The hash-prefix for `$location` hash-bang URLs has changed from the empty
string """" to the bang ""!"". If your application does not use HTML5 mode
or is being run on browsers that do not support HTML5 mode, and you have
not specified your own hash-prefix then client side URLs will now contain
a ""!"" prefix. For example, rather than `mydomain.com/#/a/b/c` will become
`mydomain/#!/a/b/c`.

If you actually wanted to have no hash-prefix then you should configure
this by adding a configuration block to you application:

```
appModule.config(['$locationProvider', function($locationProvider) {
  $locationProvider.hashPrefix("""");
}]);
```"

When an error message contains an HTML string (e.g. `$location:nobase` containing `<base>`), it was
interpreted as a literal HTML element, instead of text. Error messages are not expected to render
as HTML, but we still need to use `.html()` in `errorDisplay`, so that the links created by

During it's linking phase, `ngView` relies on the info provided in `$route.current` for
instantiating the initial view. `$route.current` is set in the callback of a listener to
`$locationChangeSuccess`, which is registered during the instantiation of the `$route` service.

Thus, it is crucial that the `$route` service is instantiated before the initial
`$locationChangeSuccess` is fired. Since `ngView` declares `$route` as a dependency, the service is
instantiated in time if `ngView` is present during the initial load of the page.

Yet, in cases where `ngView` is included in a template that is loaded asynchronously (e.g. in
another directive's template), the directive factory might not be called soon enough for `$route`
to be instantiated before the initial `$locationChangeSuccess` event is fired.

This commit fixes it, by always instantiating `$route` up front, during the initialization phase.

Starting with 88bb551, `ngMock` will attach the `$injector` to the `$rootElement`, but will never
clean it up, resulting in a memory leak. Since a new `$rootElement` is created for every test,
this leak causes Karma to crash on large test-suites.
The problem was not detected by our internal tests, because we do our own clean-up in
`testabilityPatch.js`.

88bb551 was revert with 1b8590a.
This commit incorporates the changes from 88bb551 and prevents the memory leak, by cleaning up all
data attached to `$rootElement` after each test.

Although `copy()` does not need to (and never will) support all kinds of objects, there is a
(not uncommon) usecase for supporting `Blob` objects:

`ngMock`'s `$httpBackend` will return a copy of the response data (so that changes in one test won't
affect others). Since returning `Blob` objects in response to HTTP requests is a valid usecase and
since `ngMocks`'s `$httpBackend` will use `copy()` to create a copy of that data, it is reasonable
to support `Blob` objects.
(I didn't run any benchmarks, but the additional check for the type of the copied element should
have negligible impact, compared to the other stuff that `copy()` is doing.)

This commit deprecates the ngClick directive from the ngTouch module.
Additionally, it disables it by default. It can be enabled in the new $touchProvider with
the $touchProvider.ngClickOverrideEnabled() method.

The directive was conceived to remove the 300ms delay
for click events on mobile browsers, by sending a synthetic click event on touchstart.
It also tried to make sure that the original click event that the browser sends after 300ms
was ""busted"", so that no redundant ""ghost-clicks"" appear.

There are various reasons why the directive is being deprecated.

- ""This is an ugly, terrible hack!"" (says so in the source)
- It is plagued by various bugs that are hard to fix / test for all platforms (see below)
- Simply including ngTouch activates the ngClick override, which means even if you simply want
to use ngSwipe, you may break parts of your app
- There exist alternatives for removing the 300ms delay, that can be used very well with Angular:
[FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick), [Tappy!](https://github.com/filamentgroup/tappy/)
(There's also hammer.js for touch events / gestures)
- The 300ms delay itself is on the way out - Chrome and Firefox for Android remove the 300ms delay
when the usual `<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">` is set. In IE, the
`touch-action` css property can be set to `none` or `manipulation` to remove the delay. Finally,
since iOs 8, Safari doesn't delay ""slow"" taps anymore. There are some caveats though, which can be
found in this excellent article on which this summary is based: http://developer.telerik.com/featured/300-ms-click-delay-ios-8/

Note that this change does not affect the `ngSwipe` directive.

BREAKING CHANGE:

The `ngClick` override directive from the `ngTouch` module is **deprecated and disabled by default**.
This means that on touch-based devices, users might now experience a 300ms delay before a click event is fired.

If you rely on this directive, you can still enable it with the `$touchProvider.ngClickOverrideEnabled()`method:

```js
angular.module('myApp').config(function($touchProvider) {
  $touchProvider.ngClickOverrideEnabled(true);
});
```

For migration, we recommend using [FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick).
Also note that modern browsers remove the 300ms delay under some circumstances:
- Chrome and Firefox for Android remove the 300ms delay when the well-known `<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">` is set
- Internet Explorer removes the delay when  `touch-action` css property is set to `none` or `manipulation`
- Since iOs 8, Safari removes the delay on so-called ""slow taps""

See this [article by Telerik](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/300-ms-click-delay-ios-8/) for more info on the topic.
Note that this change does not affect the `ngSwipe` directive."

Previously, css animations would not cancel the timeout when the
animation ends normally (calling end explicitly / transitionEnd event).
This meant that the timeout callback fn was always called after 150% of
the animation time was over. Since the animation was already closed at this
point, it would not do any work twice, but simply remove the timer data
from the element.
This commit changes the behavior to cancel the timeout and remove the data
when it is found during animation closing.

Most systems use *IETF language tag* codes which are typically a combination
of the ISO 639 language code and ISO 3166-1 country code with an underscore
or hyphen delimiter. For example `en_US`, `en_AU`, etc.

Whilst the `$locale.id` comes close, the lowercase format makes it impossible
to transform to an IETF tag reliably. For example, it would be impossible
to deduce `en_Dsrt_US` from `en-dsrt-us`.

If directives are required through an object hash, rather than a string or array,
the required directives' controllers are bound to the current directive's controller
in much the same way as the properties are bound to using `bindToController`.

This only happens if `bindToController` is truthy.

The binding is done after the controller has been constructed and all the bindings
are guaranteed to be complete by the time the controller's `$onInit` method
is called.

This change makes it much simpler to access require controllers without the
need for manually wiring them up in link functions. In particular this
enables support for `require` in directives defined using `mod.component()`

This commit positively affects performance in two main ways:

1,  When wrapping text nodes in the compile step, we do not need the overhead
of the `forEach` function versus a normal for loop since we do not make
use of the closure for anything.

2.  When actually wrapping the node, we can completely bypass jqLite which
avoids several function calls and the overhead of cloning the wrapper node
which we already know to be unique.

Tests in applications show about an 83% decrease in time spent in this
specific loop."

Includes the following fixes (per component):

* `$sniffer`: Properly determine the expected `vendorPrefix` for MS Edge
* `input`: MS Edge does not support dates with years with more than 4 digits.
      Trying to set the value of an `input[datetime-local]` to `9999-12-31T23.59.59.999` throws an
      error (probably related to converting the date to one with a year with more than 4 digits,
      due to timezone offset).
* `$sanitize`: Fix failing tests on MS Edge
* `$animateCss`: Although the detected `vendorPrefix` for MS Edge is ""ms"", it doesn't seem to
      recognize some vendor-prefixed CSS rules (e.g. `-ms-animation-*`). Other browsers (currently)
      recognize either vendor-prefixed rules only or both.
      Fixed by adding and retrieving styles using both prefixed and un-prefixed names.
* `$compile`: Skip failing `foreignObject` test on MS Edge.
      For unknown reasons, an `<svg>` element inside a `<foreignObject>` element on MS Edge has no
      size, causing the included `<circle>` element to also have no size and thus fails an
      assertion (relying on the element having a non-zero size).
      This seems to be an MS Edge issue; i.e. it is also reproducible without Angular.
      (Tested with MS Edge version 25.10586.0.0 on Windows 10.)

BREAKING CHANGE:

Before this change, the filter assumed that the input (if not undefined/null) was of type 'string'
and that certain methods (such as `.match()`) would be available on it. Passing a non-string value
would most likely result in a not-very-useful error being thrown (trying to call a method that does
not exist) or in unexpected behavior (if the input happened to have the assumed methods).

After this change, a proper (informative) error will be thrown. If you want to pass non-string
values through `linky`, you need to explicitly convert them to strings first.
Since input values could be initialized asynchronously, `undefined` or `null` will still be
returned unchanged (without throwing an error).

Previously, the `$render` function was re-defined in the `select` directive's
`preLink` function. When a `select` element is compiled, every `option`
element inside it is linked and registered with the `selectCtrl`, which
calls `$render` to update the selected `option`. `$render` calls `selectCtrl.writeValue`,
which adds an unknown `option` in case no option is selected. In cases where
`optgroup` elements are followed by a line-break, adding the unknown `option`
confuses the html compiler and makes it call the link function of the following
`option` with a wrong element, which means this option is not correctly
registered.
Since manipulation of the DOM in the `preLink` function is wrong API usage,
the problem cannot be fixed in the compiler.

With this commit, the `$render` function is not re-defined until the `select` directive's
`postLink` function, at which point all `option` elements have been linked
already.

The commit also changes the `toEqualSelectWithOptions` matcher to
take selected options in groups into account.

Background:
Prior to ffb6b2f, there was a bug in `URL_REGEXP`, trying to match the hostname as `\S+` (meaning
any non-space character). This resulted in never actually validating the structure of the URL (e.g.
segments such as port, path, query, fragment).
Then ffb6b2f and subsequently e4bb838 fixed that bug, but revealed `URL_REGEXP`'s ""strictness"" wrt
certain parts of the URL.

Since browsers are too lenient when it comes to URL validation anyway, it doesn't make sense for
Angular to be much stricter, so this commit relaxes the ""strictness"" of `URL_REGEXP`, focusing more
on the general structure, than on the specific characters allowed in each segment.

Note 1: `URL_REGEXP` still seems to be stricter than browsers in some cases.
Note 2: Browsers don't always agree on what is a valid URL and what isn't.

Previously, ddescribe, merge-conflicts, jshint, and jscs would run
after unit & e2e tests ran. The order was orginally changed as part of
https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/9792.

While the logic is sound that style errors shouldn't block tests from
running, ddescribe should always run. This was not guaraneteed; when
Travis exits with a warning after some browsers have run, ddescribe
doesn't get run and it doesn't become apparent that not
all tests have run.

Additionally, a separate job clearly separates style from test errors,
which e.g. means you can open a PR that includes an iit to speed up
the job, and see immediately if the test passes, because the ddescribe
error is in another job."

The use element can reference external svg's (same origin) and can include
xlink javascript urls or foreign object that can execute xss.

This change disallows `<use>` elements in sanitized SVG markup.

An example of a malicious SVG document would be:

SVG to sanitize:
```
<svg><use xlink:href=""test.svg#xss"" /></svg>
```

External SVG file (test.svg)
```
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""no""?>
<svg xmlns:svg=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""
   xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" width=""100""
   height=""100""
   id=""xss"">
<a xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""javascript:alert(1)"">
  <circle cx=""50"" cy=""50"" r=""40"" stroke=""black"" stroke-width=""3"" fill=""red"" />
</a>
</svg>
```

Here the SVG to sanitize loads in the `test.svg` file via the `<use>` element.
The sanitizer is not able to parse this file, which contains malicious
executable mark-up.

This can only be taken advantage of if the external file is available via the
same origin restrictions in place.

Closes #13453

BREAKING CHANGE:

The `<use>` element is now removed from SVG passed to the `$sanitize` service.

This element is only used to import external SVG resources, which is a security
risk as the `$sanitize` service does not have access to the resource in order
to sanitize it."

All the resolves for a route are now attached to the route's local scope,
as the property whose name is given by the `resolveAs` property on the
route definition.

If `resolveAs` is not specified it defaults to `$resolve`.

This will make it easier to use `ngRoute`, by being able to reference all
the resolve values for the route, directly on the scope, rather than having
to implement a controller just to copy the resolves across manually.

For example, rather than

```js
$routeProvider.when('/', {
  resolve: {
    item1: ($http) => $http.get(...),
    item2: ($http) => $http.get(...)
  },
  template: '<my-app item1=""vm.item1"" item2=""vm.item2"">'</my-app>`,
  controllerAs: 'vm',
  controller: ['item1', 'item2', function(item1, item2) {
    this.item1 = item1;
    this.item2 = item2;
  }]
});
```

one can now do

```js
$routeProvider.when('/', {
  resolve: {
    item1: ($http) => $http.get(...),
    item2: ($http) => $http.get(...)
  },
  template: '<my-app item1=""$resolve.item1"" item2=""$resolve.item2"">'</my-app>`
});
```

BREAKING CHANGE:

A new property is being attached to the scope of the route. The default name
for this property is `$resolve`. If your scope already contains a property
with this name then it will be hidden or overwritten.

In this case, you should choose a custom name for this property, that will
not collide with other properties on the scope, by specifying the `resolveAs`
property on the route.

The new prepare class is added before the animation is pushed to the
queue and removed before the animation runs, i.e. it is immediately
available when a structural animation (enter, leave, move)
is initialized.

The class can be used to apply CSS to explicitly hide these elements
to prevent a flash of content before the animation runs.
This can happen if a structural animation (such as ng-if) sits at the
bottom of a tree which has ng-class animations on the parents.
Because child animations are spaced out with requestAnimationFrame,
the ng-enter class might not be applied in time, so the ng.if element is
briefly visible before its animation starts."

During parent structural animations, ongoing animations on child elements
are closed. These child elements are identified by their data-ng-animate

Introduced changes:

- Deprecate passing a promise as `timeout` (for `$resource` actions).
  It never worked correctly anyway.
  Now a warning is logged (using `$log.debug()`) and the property is
  removed.
- Add support for a boolean `cancellable` property in actions'
  configuration, the `$resource` factory's `options` parameter and the
  `$resourceProvider`'s `defaults` property.
  If true, the `$cancelRequest` method (added to all returned values for
  non-instance calls) will abort the request (if it's not already
  completed or aborted).
  If there is a numeric `timeout` specified on the action's configuration,
  the value of `cancellable` will be ignored.

Example usage:

```js
var Post = $resource('/posts/:id', {id: '@id'}, {
  get: {
    method: 'GET',
    cancellable: true
  }
});

var currentPost = Post.get({id: 1});
...
// A moment later the user selects another post, so
// we don't need the previous request any more
currentPost.$cancelRequest();
currentPost = Post.get({id: 2});
...
```

BREAKING CHANGE:

Using a promise as `timeout` is no longer supported and will log a
warning. It never worked the way it was supposed to anyway.

Before:

```js
var deferred = $q.defer();
var User = $resource('/api/user/:id', {id: '@id'}, {
  get: {method: 'GET', timeout: deferred.promise}
});

var user = User.get({id: 1});   // sends a request
deferred.resolve();             // aborts the request

// Now, we need to re-define `User` passing a new promise as `timeout`
// or else all subsequent requests from `someAction` will be aborted
User = $resource(...);
user = User.get({id: 2});
```

After:

```js
var User = $resource('/api/user/:id', {id: '@id'}, {
  get: {method: 'GET', cancellable: true}
});

var user = User.get({id: 1});   // sends a request
instance.$cancelRequest();      // aborts the request

user = User.get({id: 2});
```

When compiling a `replace` directive, the compiler merges the attributes from
the replaced element onto the template element.

Unfortunately, `setAttribute` and other related DOM methods do not allow certain
attribute names - in particular Angular 2 style names such as `(click)` and `[value]`.

This is relevant when using ngForward with Angular Material, since the `mgButton`
directive uses `replace` and in the former you often use `(click)`.

This fixes the problem but for those special attributes the speed is considerably
slow.

Previously, the directive bindings were evaluated against the directive's

This went unnoticed most of the time, since a property would be eventually

BREAKING CHANGE:

https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter.
(`null` and `undefined` still pass through without an error, in order to
support asynchronous loading of resources.)

Since we are promoting component directives as the building blocks of
Angular applications, this new helper provides a simpler method for
defining such directives. By using sensible, widely accepted, conventions
the number of parameters needed has been cut down dramatically.

Many component directives can now be defined by simply providing a `name`,
`template`/`templateUrl`, a `controller`, and `bindings`:

```js
myMod.component('myComp', {
  template: '<div>My name is {{myComp.name}}</div>',
  controller: function() {
  },
  bindings: { name: '=' }
});

This fixes the issue that interpolated simple expressions were evaluated twice

Long version, things happen in the following order:

* There was an overhaul on $interpolate, this overhaul changed $parse and
  incorporated the concept of an interceptor.
* Optimization on $parse landed  so expressions that have filters without
  parameters (or the parameters are constants) would be evaluated in 2 phases,
  first to evaluate the expression sans the filter evaluation and then with
  the filter evaluation. This also used interceptors [the second evaluation
  issue was added here]
* More optimizations on $parse landed and now expressions could be evaluated
  in 2 phases. One to get all the possible values that could change (lets call
  this state), the state was checked by $watch to know if an expression changed.
  The second to continue the evaluation (as long as this state is provided).
  This, once again, used interceptors

The last change, was supposed to fix the issue, but there was an assumption in
the existing code that the code would always generate the 2 phases functions,
but that is not true. If the expression is simple enough (just like the one in
your case) then the 2-phase evaluations functions are not generated. In this
case, if a stateless interceptor was added (just like what $interpolate adds)
then the state was not used and you see the function being evaluated twice.
This explains why, if you change the expression from
`Hello {{log('A')}} {{log('B')}}!` to `Hello {{log('A') + ' ' + log('B')}}!`,
then the repetition is not there.

When ngOptions is present on a select, the option directive should not be able to
register options on the selectCtrl since this may cause errors during the
ngOptions lifecycle.

This can happen in the following cases:

- there is a blank option below the select element, an ngModel
directive, an ngOptions directive and some other directive on the select
element, which compiles the children of the select
(i.e. the option elements) before ngOptions is has finished linking.

- there is a blank option below the select element, an ngModel
directive, an ngOptions directive and another directive, which uses
templateUrl and replace:true.

What happens is:
- the option directive is compiled and adds an element `$destroy` listener
that will call `ngModel.$render` when the option element is removed.
- when `ngOptions` processes the option, it removes the element, and
triggers the `$destroy` listener on the option.
- the registered `$destroy` listener calls `$render` on `ngModel`.
- $render calls `selectCtrl.writeValue()`, which accesses the `options`
object in the `ngOptions` directive.
- Since `ngOptions` has not yet completed linking the `options` has not
yet been defined and we get an error.

This fix moves the registration code for the `option` directive into the
`SelectController.registerOption()` method, which is then overridden by
the `ngOptions` directive as a `noop`.

Previously, specifying a negative `begin` whose abs value exceeds the
input's length, would behave unexpectedly (depending on the value of
`limit` relative to `begin`). E.g.:

```
limitToFilter('12345', 3, -7) === '1'
// but
limitToFilter('12345', 10, -7) === '123'
```

This commit fixes the unexpected behaviour, by setting `begin` to 0 in the
aforementioned cases. Thus, the previous examples become:

```
limitToFilter('12345', 3, -7) === limitToFilter('12345', 3, 0) === '123'
// and
limitToFilter('12345', 10, -7) === limitToFilter('12345', 10, 0) === '12345'

For transcluded directives, the transclude function can be lazily compiled
most of the time since the contents will not be needed until the
`transclude` function was actually invoked.  For example, the `transclude`
function that is passed to `ng-if` or `ng-switch-when` does not need to be
invoked until the condition that it's bound to has been matched.  For
complex trees or switch statements, this can represent significant
performance gains since compilation of branches is deferred, and that
compilation may never actually happen if it isn't needed.

There are two instances where compilation will not be lazy; when we scan
ahead in the array of directives to be processed and find at least two of
the following:

* A directive that is transcluded and does not allow multiple transclusion
* A directive that has templateUrl and replace: true
* A directive that has a template and replace: true

In both of those cases, we will need to continue eager compilation in
order to generate the multiple transclusion exception at the correct time."

Previously, even when `ng-jq` was empty (which should force the use of
jqLite), Angular tried to find jQuery on `window['']`. If it didn't find
anything there, it would fall back to jqLite (as expected).

Nonetheless, trying to access `window['']` calls `getElementById('')`,
which issues a warning in Firefox (maybe others).

This fix properly detects when `ng-jq` is empty and avoids trying to
access `window['']`.

When the min/max attributes are empty (i.e. `attrs.min/max === ''`), there
should be no min/max validation applied (i.e. all values should be valid
wrt min/max). This works correctly for `input[number]`, but not for date
input family (`input[date/datetime-local/time/week/month]`).

In the case on `input[number]`, an empty string for `attrs.min/max` is
translated to `undefined` for `minVal/maxVal` and a check for
`isUndefined(minVal/maxVal)` ensures that no min/max validation takes
place.
For the data input family, an empty string for `attrs.min/max` is
translated to `NaN` (by `parseDate()`), so an additional check (for
`isNaN(minVal/maxVal)`) is required.

lookups (one for its own ctrl, one for the optional parent).

This also fixes adding the parentForm in the following case:
- a control is removed from a parent, but its corresponding DOM
element is not destroyed
- the control is then re-added to the form

Before the fix, the control's parentForm was only set once during
controller initialization, so the the parentForm would not be set on
the control in that specific case."

`ng(Pattern|Minlength|Maxlength)` directives will now validate the
`ngModel` when on an element that is not an `input` or
a `textarea`. Previously, only their HTML5 counterparts worked on
every element.

This is because the three validators were extracted
into  separate directives (see 26d91b653ac224d9d4166fea855346f5e4c4a7b4
and 1be9bb9d3527e0758350c4f7417a4228d8571440), whereas the aliased
attribute handling assumes the validators will only exist on
`input|textarea` (see d9b90d7c10a8e1bacbee0aeb7e86093cca9e8ed2 and
25541c1f876a16c892d71faae11727bec7bba98c).

Since `ngMin` and `ngMax` are also aliased attributes, this means
observers of `min` and `max` will be fired if `ngMin` and `ngMax`
change. This will happen on any element, even if it does not have
an `ngModel`. However, since min/max validators are only ever added
as part of the `input[number|textarea]` types, even if the element
has an `ngModel`, no validators will be added.

Finally the commit also tests that `ng-required` works on any element,
although that validator worked on all elements before this fix.

Since the HTML5 pattern validation constraint validates the input value,
we should also validate against the viewValue. While this worked in
core up to Angular 1.2, in 1.3, we changed not only validation,
but the way `input[date]` and `input[number]` are handled - they parse
their input values into `Date` and `Number` respectively, which cannot
be validated by a regex.

Fixes #12344

BREAKING CHANGE:

The `ngPattern` and `pattern` directives will validate the regex
against the `viewValue` of `ngModel`, i.e. the value of the model
before the $parsers are applied. Previously, the modelValue
(the result of the $parsers) was validated.

This fixes issues where `input[date]` and `input[number]` cannot
be validated because the viewValue string is parsed into
`Date` and `Number` respectively (starting with Angular 1.3).
It also brings the directives in line with HTML5 constraint
validation, which validates against the input value.

This change is unlikely to cause applications to fail, because even
in Angular 1.2, the value that was validated by pattern could have
been manipulated by the $parsers, as all validation was done
inside this pipeline.

If you rely on the pattern being validated against the modelValue,
you must create your own validator directive that overwrites
the built-in pattern validator:

```
.directive('patternModelOverwrite', function patternModelOverwriteDirective() {
  return {
    restrict: 'A',
    require: '?ngModel',
    priority: 1,
    compile: function() {
      var regexp, patternExp;

      return {
        pre: function(scope, elm, attr, ctrl) {
          if (!ctrl) return;

          attr.$observe('pattern', function(regex) {
            /**
             * The built-in directive will call our overwritten validator
             * (see below). We just need to update the regex.
             * The preLink fn guaranetees our observer is called first.
             */
            if (isString(regex) && regex.length > 0) {
              regex = new RegExp('^' + regex + '$');
            }

            if (regex && !regex.test) {
              //The built-in validator will throw at this point
              return;
            }

            regexp = regex || undefined;
          });

        },
        post: function(scope, elm, attr, ctrl) {
          if (!ctrl) return;

          regexp, patternExp = attr.ngPattern || attr.pattern;

          //The postLink fn guarantees we overwrite the built-in pattern validator
          ctrl.$validators.pattern = function(value) {
            return ctrl.$isEmpty(value) ||
              isUndefined(regexp) ||
              regexp.test(value);
          };
        }
      };
    }
  };
});

This patch ensures that the provided `options.delay` value is
applied before the CSS classes are applied to the element.

This fix ensures that a structural child animation will never close a
parent class based early so that the CSS classes for the child are ready
for it to perform its CSS animation. The reasoning for the past for this
was because their is a one frame delay before the classes were applied.
If a parent and a child animation happen at the same time then the
animations may not be picked up for the element since the CSS classes
may not have been applied yet.

This fix ensures that parent CSS classes are applied in a synchronous
manner without the need to run a one RAF wait. The solution to this was
to apply the preparation classes during the pre-digest phase and then
apply the CSS classes right after with a forced reflow paint.

BREAKING CHANGE: CSS classes added/removed by ngAnimate are now applied
synchronously once the first digest has passed.

The previous behavior involved ngAnimate having to wait for one
requestAnimationFrame before CSS classes were added/removed. The CSS classes
are now applied directly after the first digest that is triggered after
`$animate.addClass`, `$animate.removeClass` or `$animate.setClass` is
called. If any of your code relies on waiting for one frame before
checking for CSS classes on the element then please change this
behavior. If a parent class-based animation, however, is run through a
JavaScript animation which triggers an animation for `beforeAddClass`
and/or `beforeRemoveClass` then the CSS classes will not be applied
in time for the children (and the parent class-based animation will not
be cancelled by any child animations).

The `window.location.hash' setter will strip of a single leading hash character

This meant that if we want the fragment to lead with a hash character, we
must do `window.location.hash = '##test'` to ensure that the first hash
character in the fragment is not lost.

The `$location.hash` setter works differently and assumes that the value
passed is the the full fragment, i.e. it does not attempt to strip off a
single leading hash character.

Previously, if you called, `$location.hash('#test')`, the leading hash was
being stripped and the resulting url fragment did not contain this hash:
`$location.hash()`, then became 'test' rather than `#test`, which led to
an infinite digest.

Before in RC0 and RC1 $animateCss would not return anything if a
CSS-based animation was not detected. This was a messy API decision
which resulted in the user having to have an if statement to handle the
failure case. This patch ensures that an animator object with the start()
and end() functions is always returned. If an animation is not detected
then the preperatory CSS styles and classes are removed immediately and
the element is cleaned up, however a ""dump"" animator object is still
returned which allows for callbacks and promises to be applied.

The returned object now also contains a `valid` property which can be
examined to determine whether an animation is set to run on the element.

BREAKING CHANGE: The $animateCss service will now always return an
object even if the animation is not set to run. If your code is using
$animateCss then please consider the following code change:

```
// before

started and closed.

BREAKING CHANGE: partially or fully using a regex value containing

In orderto accomodate this patch, some changes have been necessary elsewhere in the codebase,
in order to facilitate iterating, comparingand copying objects with a null prototype, or which
shadow the `hasOwnProperty` method

Summary:

- fast paths for various internal functions when createMap() is used
- Make createMap() safe for internal functions like copy/equals/forEach
- Use createMap() in more places to avoid needing hasOwnProperty()

In `ngRepeat` if the object to be iterated over is ""array-like"" then it only iterates
over the numerical indexes rather than every key on the object. This prevents ""helper""
methods from being included in the rendered collection.

This commit changes `ngOptions` to iterate in the same way.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Although it is unlikely that anyone is using it in this way, this change does change the
behaviour of `ngOptions` in the following case:

* you are iterating over an array-like object, using the array form of the `ngOptions` syntax
(`item.label for item in items`) and that object contains non-numeric property keys.

In this case these properties with non-numeric keys will be ignored.

** Here array-like is defined by the result of a call to this internal function:
https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/v1.4.0-rc.1/src/Angular.js#L198-L211 **

To get the desired behaviour you need to iterate using the object form of the `ngOptions` syntax
(`value.label` for (key, value) in items)`).

Using a deep watch caused Angular to enter an infinite recursion in the
case that the model contains a circular reference.  Using `$watchCollection`
instead prevents this from happening.

This change means that we will not re-render the directive when there is
a change below the first level of properties on the model object. Making
such a change is a strange corner case that is unlikely to occur in practice
and the directive is not designed to support such a situation. The
documentation has been updated to clarify this behaviour.

This is not a breaking change since in 1.3.x this scenario did not work
at all. Compare 1.3.15: http://plnkr.co/edit/zsgnhflQ3M1ClUSrsne0?p=preview

Beforehand it was impossible to issue an animation via $animate on an
element that is outside the realm of an Angular app. Take for example a
dropdown menu where the menu is positioned with absolute positioning...
The element will most likely need to be placed by the `<body>` tag, but
if the angular application is bootstrapped elsewhere then it cannot be
animated.

This fix provides support for `$animate.pin()` which allows for an
external element to be virtually placed in the DOM structure of a host
parent element within the DOM of an angular app."

All of ngAnimate has been rewritten to make the internals of the
animation code more flexible, reuseable and performant.

BREAKING CHANGE: JavaSript and CSS animations can no longer be run in
parallel. With earlier versions of ngAnimate, both CSS and JS animations
would be run together when multiple animations were detected. This
feature has now been removed, however, the same effect, with even more
possibilities, can be achieved by injecting `$animateCss` into a
JavaScript-defined animation and creating custom CSS-based animations
from there. Read the ngAnimate docs for more info.

BREAKING CHANGE: The function params for `$animate.enabled()` when an
element is used are now flipped. This fix allows the function to act as
a getter when a single element param is provided.

```js
// < 1.4
$animate.enabled(false, element);

// 1.4+
$animate.enabled(element, false);
```

BREAKING CHANGE: In addition to disabling the children of the element,
`$animate.enabled(element, false)` will now also disable animations on
the element itself.

BREAKING CHANGE: Animation-related callbacks are now fired on
`$animate.on` instead of directly being on the element.

```js
// < 1.4
element.on('$animate:before', function(e, data) {
  if (data.event === 'enter') { ... }
});
element.off('$animate:before', fn);

// 1.4+
$animate.on(element, 'enter', function(data) {
  //...
});
$animate.off(element, 'enter', fn);
```

BREAKING CHANGE: There is no need to call `$scope.$apply` or
`$scope.$digest` inside of a animation promise callback anymore
since the promise is resolved within a digest automatically (but a
digest is not run unless the promise is chained).

```js
// < 1.4
$animate.enter(element).then(function() {
  $scope.$apply(function() {
    $scope.explode = true;
  });
});

// 1.4+
$animate.enter(element).then(function() {
  $scope.explode = true;
});
```

BREAKING CHANGE: When an enter, leave or move animation is triggered then it
will always end any pending or active parent class based animations
(animations triggered via ngClass) in order to ensure that any CSS
styles are resolved in time."

If jQuery was used with Angular the touch logic was looking for touches
under the original event object. However, jQuery wraps all events, keeping
the original one under the originalEvent property and copies/normalizes some
of event properties. Not all properties are copied, e.g. touches which caused
them to not be recognized properly.

Thanks to @mcmar & @pomerantsev for original patch ideas.

For more detailed information refer to this document:
https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1pbtW2yvtmFBikfRrJd8VAsabiFkKezmYZ_PbgdjQOVU/edit

**Example:**

```html

{{recipients.length, plural, offset:1
    =0 {You gave no gifts}
    =1 { {{ recipients[0].gender, select,
              male {You gave him a gift.}

              other {You gave them a gift.}
          }}
       }
    one { {{ recipients[0].gender, select,
              male {You gave him and one other person a gift.}
              female {You gave her and one other person a gift.}
              other {You gave them and one other person a gift.}
          }}
       }
    other {You gave {{recipients[0].gender}} and # other people gifts. }
}}
```

This is a SEPARATE module so you MUST include `angular-messageformat.js`
or `angular-messageformat.min.js`.

In addition, your application module should depend on the ""ngMessageFormat""
(e.g. angular.module('myApp', ['ngMessageFormat']);)

When you use the `ngMessageFormat`, the $interpolate gets overridden with
a new service that adds the new MessageFormat behavior.

**Syntax differences from MessageFormat:**

- MessageFormat directives are always inside `{{ }}` instead of
  single `{ }`.  This ensures a consistent interpolation syntax (else you
  could interpolate in more than one way and have to pick one based on
  the features availability for that syntax.)
- The first part of such a syntax can be an arbitrary Angular
  expression instead of a single identifier.
- You can nest them as deep as you want.  As mentioned earlier, you
  would use `{{ }}` to start the nested interpolation that may optionally
  include select/plural extensions.
- Only `select` and `plural` keywords are currently recognized.
- Quoting support is coming in a future commit.
- Positional arguments/placeholders are not supported. They don't make
  sense in Angular templates anyway (they are only helpful when using
  API calls from a programming language.)
- Redefining of the startSymbol (`{{`) and endSymbol (`}}`) used for
  interpolation is not yet supported.

After #11124 got merged, a security vulnerability got introduced.
Animation in SVG became tolerated by the sanitizer.

Exploit Example:
```
<svg>
  <a xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""?"">
    <circle r=""400""></circle>
    <animate attributeName=""xlink:href"" begin=""0"" from=""javascript:alert(1)"" to=""&"" />
  </a>
</svg>
```

Here we are animating an anchor's href, starting from a value that's a javascript URI,
allowing the executing of arbitrary javascript in the process.

Preventing only the animation of links is tricky, as SVG is weird and namespaces aren't predictable.
We've decided to have the sanitizer filter out svg animation tags instead.

Considering the sanitizer is commonly used to sanitize untrusted HTML code, this shouldn't affect
many apps in the wild. Also, no release has been with #11124 in it, but not this fix.

This problem is beset by the problem of `ngModel` expecting models  to be
atomic things (primitives/objects).

> When it was first invented it was expected that ngModel would only be
a primitive, e.g. a string or a number. Later when things like ngList and
ngOptions were added or became more complex then various hacks were put
in place to make it look like it worked well with those but it doesn't.

-------------

Just to be clear what is happening, lets name the objects:

```js
var option1 = { uid: 1, name: 'someName1' };
var option2 = { uid: 2, name: 'someName2' };
var option3 = { uid: 3, name: 'someName3' };

var initialItem = { uid: 1, name: 'someName1' };

model {
  options: [option1, option2, option3],
  selected: initialItem
};
```

Now when we begin we have:

```js
expect(model.selected).toBe(initialItem);
expect(model.selected.uid).toEqual(option1.uid);
expect(model.selected).not.toBe(option1);
```

So although `ngOptions` has found a match between an option and the
modelValue, these are not the same object.

Now if we change the properties of the `model.selected` object, we are
effectively changing the `initialItem` object.

```js
model.selected.uid = 3;
model.selected.name = 'someName3';

expect(model.selected).toBe(initialItem);
expect(model.selected.uid).toEqual(option3.uid);
expect(model.selected).not.toBe(option3);
```

At the moment `ngModel` only watches for changes to the object identity
and so it doesn't trigger an update to the `ngOptions` directive.

This commit fixes this in `ngOptions` by adding a **deep** watch on the
`attr.ngModel` expression...

```js
scope.$watch(attr.ngModel, updateOptions, true);
```

You can see that in this Plunker:
http://plnkr.co/edit/0PE7qN5FXIA23y4RwyN0?p=preview

-------

But this isn't the end of the story. Since `ngModel` and `ngOptions` did
not make copies between the model and the view, we can't go around just
changing the properties of the `model.selected` object. This is particularly
important in the situation where the user has actually chosen an option,
since the `model.selected` points directly to one of the option objects:

```js
// User selects ""someName2"" option
expect(model.selected).toBe(option2);
expect(model.selected.uid).toEqual(option2.uid);
expect(model.selected).not.toBe(initialOption);
```

If we now change the `model.selected` object's properties we are actually
changing the `option2` object:

```js
expect(model.selected).toBe(option2);

model.selected.uid = 3;
model.selected.name = 'someName3';

expect(model.selected).toBe(option2);
expect(model.selected).not.toBe(option3);

expect(option2.uid).toEqual(3);
expect(option2.name).toEqual('someName3');
```

which means that the options are now broken:

```js
expect(model.options).toEqual([
  { uid: 1, name: 'someName1' },
  { uid: 3, name: 'someName3' },
  { uid: 3, name: 'someName3' }
]);
```

This commit fixes this in `ngOptions` by making copies when reading the
value if `track by` is being used. If we are not using `track by` then
we really do care about the identity of the object and should not be
copying...

You can see this in the Plunker here:

Minor change, but the heading for ""View independent business logic...""

Perhaps it's because I'm new to javascript and its terminology,
but I read ""View"" as a verb rather than a noun on the first pass and
had to read on a bit to understand that it was, instead,
referring to The View. If you go just by grammar rules,
making ""view independent"" into the compound adjective,
""view-independent"", makes it clear that it is modifying ""business logic"".

The new API on `$cookies` includes:

 * `get`
 * `put`
 * `getObject`
 * `putObject`
 * `getAll`
 * `remove`

The new API no longer polls the browser for changes to the cookies and no longer copy
cookie values onto the `$cookies` object.

The polling is expensive and caused issues with the `$cookies` properties not
synchronizing correctly with the actual browser cookie values.

The reason the polling was originally added was to allow communication between
different tabs, but there are better ways to do this today (for example `localStorage`).

DEPRECATION NOTICE:

`$cookieStore` is now deprecated as all the useful logic
has been moved to `$cookies`, to which `$cookieStore` now simply
delegates calls.

BREAKING CHANGE:

`$cookies` no longer exposes properties that represent the current browser cookie
values. Now you must explicitly the methods described above to access the cookie
values. This also means that you can no longer watch the `$cookies` properties for
changes to the browser's cookies.

This feature is generally only needed if a 3rd party library was programmatically
changing the cookies at runtime. If you rely on this then you must either write code that
can react to the 3rd party library making the changes to cookies or implement your own polling
mechanism.

For $validate(), it is necessary to store the parseError state
in the controller. Otherwise, if the parser name equals a validator
key, $validate() will assume a parse error occured if the validator
is invalid.

Also, setting the validity for the parser now happens after setting
validity for the validator key. Otherwise, the parse key is set,
and then immediately afterwards the validator key is unset
(because parse errors remove all other validations).

Prior to this fix it was impossible to apply a binding to a the
ngMessage directive to represent the name of the error. It was also
not possible to use ngRepeat or any other structural directive to
dynamically update the list of messages. This feature patch ensures
that both ngMessages can render expressions and automatically update
when any dynamic message data changes.

BREAKING CHANGE:

The `ngMessagesInclude` attribute is now its own directive and that must
be placed as a **child** element within the element with the ngMessages
directive. (Keep in mind that the former behaviour of the
ngMessageInclude attribute was that all **included** ngMessage template
code was placed at the **bottom** of the element containing the
ngMessages directive; therefore to make this behave in the same way,
place the element containing the ngMessagesInclude directive at the
end of the container containing the ngMessages directive).

```html
<!-- AngularJS 1.3.x -->
<div ng-messages=""model.$error"" ng-messages-include=""remote.html"">
  <div ng-message=""required"">Your message is required</div>
</div>

<!-- AngularJS 1.4.x -->
<div ng-messages=""model.$error"">
  <div ng-message=""required"">Your message is required</div>
  <div ng-messages-include=""remote.html""></div>
</div>

Previously, if a directive definition object was defined with methods like `compile`
provided on the prototype rather than the instance, the Angular compiler failed
to use these methods when the directive had a `templateURL`. This change ensures
that these prototypical methods are not lost.

This enables developers to define their directives using ""classes"" such as
in CoffeeScript or ES6.

Change the way parse works from the old mechanism to a multiple stages
parsing and code generation. The new parse is a four stages parsing
* Lexer
* AST building
* AST processing
* Cacheing, one-time binding and `$watch` optimizations

The Lexer phase remains unchanged.

AST building phase follows Mozilla Parse API [1] and generates an AST that
is compatible. The only exception was needed for `filters` as JavaScript
does not support filters, in this case, a filter is transformed into a
`CallExpression` that has an extra property named `filter` with the value
of `true`.

The AST processing phase transforms the AST into a function that can be
executed to evaluate the expression. The logic for expressions remains
unchanged. The AST processing phase works in two different ways depending
if csp is enabled or disabled. If csp is enabled, the processing phase
returns pre-generated function that interpret specific parts of the AST.
When csp is disabled, then the entire expression is compiled into a single
function that is later evaluated using `Function`. In both cases, the
returning function has the properties `constant`, `literal` and `inputs`
as in the previous implementation. These are used in the next phase to
perform different optimizations.

The cacheing, one-time binding and `$watch` optimizations phase remains
mostly unchanged.

behavior when using directives (especially with ngTransclude!). I think it's a good pattern
to encourage and might prevent a bug down the road for for people who just scan for the
monospace font. See
[Understanding Scopes](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes)
for mgModel best practices.

When `lastCount` was evaluated to an non-numeric value (e.g. ""other"") and
`count` was evaluated to `NaN` (e.g. `null`/`undefined`), the text content
would be (wrongly) based on the previous template.
This commits makes sure the text content is updated correctly.

In order to customize the message shown upon `null`/`undefined` one can
specify a `'NaN'` property on the `when` exression object.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, the order of items when using ngRepeat to iterate
over object properties was guaranteed to be consistent by sorting the
keys into alphabetic order.

Now, the order of the items is browser dependent based on the order returned
from iterating over the object using the `for key in obj` syntax.

It seems that browsers generally follow the strategy of providing
keys in the order in which they were defined, although there are exceptions
when keys are deleted and reinstated. See
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete#Cross-browser_issues

The best approach is to convert Objects into Arrays by a filter such as
https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter
or some other mechanism, and then sort them manually in the order you need.

**Major reworking of select and ngOptions**:

* The `SelectController` is now used as an abstraction for the `select` and `ngOptions` directives
to override to get their desired behaviour
* The `select` directive is completely oblivious to the ngOptions directive now - the `ngOptions`
directive could be deleted without having to make any changes to the `select` directive.
* Select related directives (single/multiple/ngOptions) can provide specific versions of
`SelectController.writeValue` and `SelectController.readValue`, which are responsible for getting
the `$viewValue` in or out of the actual `<select>` element and its `<option>` children.

BREAKING CHANGE:

When using `ngOptions`: the directive applies a surrogate key as the value of the `<option>` element.
This commit changes the actual string used as the surrogate key. We now store a string that is computed
by calling `hashKey` on the item in the options collection; previously it was the index or key of the
item in the collection.

(This is in keeping with the way that the unknown option value is represented in the select directive.)

Before you might have seen:

```
<select ng-model=""x"" ng-option=""i in items"">
  <option value=""1"">a</option>
  <option value=""2"">b</option>
  <option value=""3"">c</option>
  <option value=""4"">d</option>
</select>
```

Now it will be something like:

```
<select ng-model=""x"" ng-option=""i in items"">
  <option value=""string:a"">a</option>
  <option value=""string:b"">b</option>
  <option value=""string:c"">c</option>
  <option value=""string:d"">d</option>
</select>
```

If your application code relied on this value, which it shouldn't, then you will need to modify your
application to accommodate this. You may find that you can use the `track by` feaure of `ngOptions`
as this provides the ability to specify the key that is stored.

BREAKING CHANGE:

When iterating over an object's properties using the `(key, value) in obj` syntax
the order of the elements used to be sorted alphabetically. This was an artificial
attempt to create a deterministic ordering since browsers don't guarantee the order.
But in practice this is not what people want and so this change iterates over properties
in the order they are returned by Object.keys(obj), which is almost always the order
in which the properties were defined.

The existing documentation claims that dateFilter determines week no
according to the ISO8601 standard, but this is not the case as illustrated
by tests in this PR. More specifically, the implementation deviates from
ISO8601 in 2 important aspects:
- impl assumes Sun to be the first day of a week, ISO8601 mandates Mon
- impl allows weeks 0 (for years starting on Fri, Sat) while ISO8601
would mark them as a week 52/53 of a previous year.

8bfeddb5d671017f4a21b8b46334ac816710b143 added changes to make relational operator work as it
normally would in JS --- unfortunately, this broke due to my failure to account for typeof null
being ""object"".

This refactoring attempts to convert object values to primitives still, in a fashion similar to
the SortCompare (and subsequently the ToString() algorithm) from ES, in order to account for `null`
and also simplify code to some degree.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, if either value being compared in the orderBy comparator was null or undefined, the
order would not change. Now, this order behaves more like Array.prototype.sort, which by default
pushes `null` behind objects, due to `n` occurring after `[` (the first characters of their
stringified forms) in ASCII / Unicode. If `toString` is customized, or does not exist, the
behaviour is undefined.

Previously if there was a hash fragment but no hashPrefix we would throw an error.
Now we assume that the hash-bang path is empty and that the hash is a valid fragment.

This prevents unnecessary exceptions where we clear the hashBang path, say by
navigating back to the base url, where the $browser leaves an empty hash symbol
on the URL to ensure there is no browser reload.

BREAKING CHANGE:

We no longer throw an `ihshprfx` error if the URL after the base path
contains only a hash fragment.  Previously, if the base URL was `http://abc.com/base/`
and the hashPrefix is `!` then trying to parse `http://abc.com/base/#some-fragment`
would have thrown an error. Now we simply assume it is a normal fragment and
that the path is empty, resulting `$location.absUrl() === ""http://abc.com/base/#!/#some-fragment""`.

This should not break any applications, but you can no longer rely on receiving the
`ihshprfx` error for paths that have the syntax above. It is actually more similar
to what currently happens for invalid extra paths anyway:  If the base URL
and hashPrfix are set up as above, then `http://abc.com/base/other/path` does not
throw an error but just ignores the extra path: `http://abc.com/base`.

In ES262, there are two properties which are used to get a primitive value from an Object:

- valueOf() -- a method which returns a primitive value represented by the Object
- toString() -- a method which returns a string value representing the Object.

When comparing objects using relational operators, the abstract operation ToPrimitive(O, TypeHint) is used,
which will use these methods to retrieve a value.

This CL emulates the behaviour of ToPrimitive(), and ensures that no ordering occurs if the retrieved value
is identical.

This behaviour was previously used for Date objects, however it can be safely made generic as it applies to
all objects.

Email addresses can (under certain restrictions) include double quote
characters. See http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696#section-3.

For example, `""Jo Bloggs""@abc.com` is a valid email address.

When serializing emails to the `href` attribute of an anchor element,
we must HTML encode these double quote characters. See
http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/syntax.html#syntax-attr-double-quoted

This commit does not attempt to improve the functionality (i.e. regex)
that attempts to identify email addresses in a general string.

This commit tried to create consistency by ensuring that `$isEmpty` is not
called on both model and view values but it chose to only use `$modelValue`,
which is not actually correct.

`$isEmpty` is designed to compute whether the `$viewValue` is empty. In
practice this is the only part of the parse/format system that the
directive has control over. We can't rely on the `$modelValue` being in
any particular format since other directives can add in their own formatters
and parsers to completely change this.

Many thanks to @NevilleS and @jbedard for collaborating with me on a solution to this!

Closes #9394
Closes #9865

BREAKING CHANGE: previously, ngModel invoked getter/setters in the global context.

For example:

```js
<input ng-model=""model.value"" ng-model-options=""{ getterSetter: true }"">
```

would previously invoke `model.value()` in the global context.

Now, ngModel invokes `value` with `model` as the context.

It's unlikely that real apps relied on this behavior. If they did they can use `.bind` to explicilty
bind a getter/getter to the global context, or just reference globals normally without `this`."

Previously, setting the maxlength to a negative number, would make all

This commit changes the behaviour of maxlength/ngMaxlength, effectively
disabling the maxlength validation (always returning true) when maxlength
is set to a negative number. This is more inline to how the HTML5
`maxlength` attribute works (both in browsers and according to the spec:

Narretz,2014-11-12 20:08:39,https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/git/commits/e3764e30a301ec6136c8e6b5493d39feb3cd1ecc,e3764e30a301ec6136c8e6b5493d39feb3cd1ecc,"fix(ngModel): don't run parsers when executing $validate

Previously, $validate would execute the parsers to obtain a
modelValue for validation. This was necessary, because a validator
that is called outside of model / view update (e.g. from an observer)
otherwise might only an undefined modelValue, because a previous
view update has found a validation $error and set the model
to undefined (as is tradition in angular)

This is problematic as validators that are run immediately after
the ngModelController initializes would parse the modelValue
and replace the model, even though there had been no user input.

The solution is to go back to an older design: the ngModelController
will now internally record the $$rawModelValue. This means a model
or view update will store the set / parsed modelValue regardless
of validity, that is, it will never set it to undefined because of
validation errors.

When $validate is called, the $$rawModelValue will passed to the
validators. If the validity has changed, the usual behavior is kept:
if it became invalid, set the model to undefined, if valid,
restore the last available modelValue - the $$rawModelValue.

Additionally, $validate will only update the model when the validity
changed. This is to prevent setting initially invalid models other
than undefined to undefined (see #9063)

The `$compile` public API documentation indicates that
a transclude function may be passed as a second parameter, but
it was not clear that this is **not** the same function that is given
to directive link functions as the `transcludeFn` parameter.

We would like to be able to pass in a transclude function the public
linking function that is returned from `$compile` if we wish to, for
example, use lazy compilation inside a directive.

Doing so, however, highlighted two bugs:

* First, the transclude function would get rebound, incorrectly, changing
its scope from its original binding.
* Second, the `containingScope` would not be updated and the wrong
`$parent` would be assigned to the `transcludedScope` resulting in a
memory leak.

This patch fixes both of these issues.

It also converts various private optional positional parameters on `publicLinkFn`
into an `options` parameter, which is an object hash. The new `options`
parameter is documented as part of the public API.

Thanks to @lgalfaso, @tbosch, and @petebacondarwin.

When writing tests it's often useful to check the number of child scopes

directives is to test that the directive is properly cleaning up after itself. These
new methods simplify writing assertions that verify that child scopes were properly
destroyed or that watchers were deregistered.

$animate now supports an optional parameter which provides CSS styling
which will be provided into the CSS-based animations as well as any
custom animation functions. Once the animation is complete then the
styles will be applied directly to the element. If no animation is
detected or the `ngAnimate` module is not active then the styles
will be applied immediately.

BREAKING CHANGE: staggering animations that use transitions will now
always block the transition from starting (via `transition: 0s none`)
up until the stagger step kicks in. The former behaviour was that the
block was removed as soon as the pending class was added. This fix
allows for styles to be applied in the pending class without causing
an animation to trigger prematurely."

This fixes a regression that was introduced in 2bcd02d. Basically, the problem was that render() removed the wrong option from the select controller since it assumed that the option that was removed has the same label as the excessive option in existingOptions, but this is only correct if the option was popped from the end of the array.

Currently, when the location provider is set to html5 mode, all links

desirable behavior in some cases (such as using ngRoute), not all cases

One example would be an application using the
[ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) library, with some
pages that exist outside of angular. Links that are meant to go through
the router use the `ui-sref` directive, so the rewrite behavior is
unnecessary.

When ngAnimate is used, it will defer changes to classes until postDigest. Previously,
AngularJS (when ngAnimate is not loaded) would always immediately perform these DOM
operations.

Now, even when the ngAnimate module is not used, if $rootScope is in the midst of a
digest, class manipulation is deferred. This helps reduce jank in browsers such as
IE11.

BREAKING CHANGE:

The $animate class API will always defer changes until the end of the next digest. This allows ngAnimate
to coalesce class changes which occur over a short period of time into 1 or 2 DOM writes, rather than
many. This prevents jank in browsers such as IE, and is generally a good thing.

If you're finding that your classes are not being immediately applied, be sure to invoke $digest().

However, it's basically harmless.

Side effects:

Use strict equality check for `undefined` to replace with empty string. Most target browsers will output `undefined` rather than the empty
string if we don't do this. Previously, ngBindTemplate did not perform this check. However the change has been made to make behaviour
consistent across all target browsers (chrome does output the empty string).

Transcluded scopes are now connected to the scope in which they are created
via their `$parent` property. This means that they will be automatically destroyed
when their ""containing"" scope is destroyed, without having to resort to listening
for a `$destroy` event on various DOM elements or other scopes.

Previously, transclude scope not only inherited prototypically from the scope from
which they were transcluded but they were also still owned by that ""outer"" scope.
This meant that there were scenarios where the ""real"" container scope/element was
destroyed but the transclude scope was not, leading to memory leaks.

The original strategy for dealing with this was to attach a `$destroy` event handler
to the DOM elements in the transcluded content, so that if the elements were removed
from the DOM then their associated transcluded scope would be destroyed.

This didn't work for transclude contents that didn't contain any elements - most
importantly in the case of the transclude content containing an element transclude
directive at its root, since the compiler swaps out this element for a comment
before a destroy handler could be attached.

BREAKING CHANGE:

`$transclude` functions no longer attach `$destroy` event handlers to the
transcluded content, and so the associated transclude scope will not automatically
be destroyed if you remove a transcluded element from the DOM using direct DOM
manipulation such as the jquery `remove()` method.

If you want to explicitly remove DOM elements inside your directive that have
been compiled, and so potentially contain child (and transcluded) scopes, then
it is your responsibility to get hold of the scope and destroy it at the same time.

The suggested approach is to create a new child scope of your own around any DOM
elements that you wish to manipulate in this way and destroy those scopes if you
remove their contents - any child scopes will then be destroyed and cleaned up
automatically.

Note that all the built-in directives that manipulate the DOM (ngIf, ngRepeat,
ngSwitch, etc) already follow this best practice, so if you only use these for
manipulating the DOM then you do not have to worry about this change.

This feature allows disabling Angular's requirement of using a <base/> tag
when using location in html5Mode, for applications that do not require
using $location in html5Mode in IE9. To accomplish this, the $locationProvider.html5Mode 
method has been changed to accept a definition object which can optionally set a 
requireBase property to false, removing the requirement of a <base> tag being present
when html5Mode is enabled.

BREAKING CHANGE: The $location.html5Mode API has changed to allow enabling html5Mode by
    passing an object (as well as still supporting passing a boolean). Symmetrically, the
    method now returns an object instead of a boolean value.

    To migrate, follow the code example below:

    Before:

    var mode = $locationProvider.html5Mode();

    After:

    var mode = $locationProvider.html5Mode().enabled;

This commit refactors how the search index is built. The docsSearch service
is now defined by a provider, which returns a different implementation of
the service depending upon whether the current browser supports WebWorkers

* **WebWorker supported**: The index is then built and stored in a new worker.
The service posts and receives messages to and from this worker to make
queries on the search index.

* **WebWorker no supported**: The index is built locally but with a 500ms
delay so that the initial page can render before the browser is blocked as
the index is built.

Also the way that the current app is identified has been modified so we can
slim down the js data files (pages-data.js) to again improve startup time.

With this change, expressions like ""firstName + ' ' + lastName | uppercase""
will be analyzed and only the inputs for the expression will be watched
(in this case ""firstName"" and ""lastName""). Only when at least one of the inputs
change, the expression will be evaluated.

This change speeds up simple expressions like `firstName | noop` by ~15%
and more complex expressions like `startDate | date` by ~2500%.

BREAKING CHANGE: all filters are assumed to be stateless functions

Previously it was a good practice to make all filters stateless, but now
it's a requirement in order for the model change-observation to pick up
all changes.

If an existing filter is statefull, it can be flagged as such but keep in
mind that this will result in a significant performance-penalty (or rather
lost opportunity to benefit from a major perf improvement) that will
affect the $digest duration.

To flag a filter as stateful do the following:

myApp.filter('myFilter', function() {
  function myFilter(input) { ... };
  myFilter.$stateful = true;
  return myFilter;
});

Fix the following exploit:

The exploit:
• 1. Array.sort takes a comparison function and passes it 2 parameters to compare.
  2. It then calls .valueOf() if the result is not a primitive.
• The Function object conveniently accepts two string arguments so we can use this
  to construct a function.  However, this doesn't do much unless we can execute it.
• We set the valueOf function on Function.prototype to Function.prototype.call.
  This causes the function that we constructed to be executed when sort calls
  .valueOf() on the result of the comparison.

The fix is in two parts.
• Disallow passing unsafe objects to function calls as parameters.
• Do not traverse the Function object when setting a path."

tbosch,2014-09-05 00:50:26,https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/git/commits/6046e14bd22491168116e61ffdf5fd3fed5f135c,6046e14bd22491168116e61ffdf5fd3fed5f135c,"refactor(ngModelController,formController): centralize and simplify logic

The previous logic for async validation in
`ngModelController` and `formController` was not maintainable:
- control logic is in multiple parts, e.g. `ctrl.$setValidity`
  waits for end of promises and continuous the control flow
  for async validation
- logic for updating the flags `ctrl.$error`, `ctrl.$pending`, `ctrl.$valid`
  is super complicated, especially in `formController`

This refactoring makes the following changes:
- simplify async validation: centralize control logic
  into one method in `ngModelController`:
  * remove counters `invalidCount` and `pendingCount`
  * use a flag `currentValidationRunId` to separate
    async validator runs from each other
  * use `$q.all` to determine when all async validators are done
- centralize way how `ctrl.$modelValue` and `ctrl.$invalidModelValue`
  is updated
- simplify `ngModelController/formCtrl.$setValidity` and merge
  `$$setPending/$$clearControlValidity/$$clearValidity/$$clearPending`
  into one method, that is used by `ngModelController` AND
  `formController`
  * remove diff calculation, always calculate the correct state anew,
    only cache the css classes that have been set to not
    trigger too many css animations.
  * remove fields from `ctrl.$error` that are valid and add private `ctrl.$$success`:
    allows to correctly separate states for valid, invalid, skipped and pending,
    especially transitively across parent forms.
- fix bug in `ngModelController`:
  * only read out `input.validity.badInput`, but not
    `input.validity.typeMismatch`,
    to determine parser error: We still want our `email`
    validator to run event when the model is validated.
- fix bugs in tests that were found as the logic is now consistent between
  `ngModelController` and `formController`

BREAKING CHANGE:
- `ctrl.$error` does no more contain entries for validators that were
  successful.
- `ctrl.$setValidity` now differentiates between `true`, `false`,
  `undefined` and `null`, instead of previously only truthy vs falsy.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Ever since 0df93fd, tagged in v1.0.0rc1, the ngSwitch directive has had an undocumented `change`
attribute, used for evaluating a scope expression when the switch value changes.

While it's unlikely, applications which may be using this feature should work around the removal
by adding a custom directive which will perform the eval instead. Directive controllers are
re-instantiated when being transcluded, so by putting the attribute on each item that you want
to be notified of a change to, you can more or less emulate the old behaviour.

Example:

```js
angular.module(""switchChangeWorkaround"", []).
  directive(""onSwitchChanged"", function() {
    return {
      linke: function($scope, $attrs) {
        $scope.$parent.$eval($attrs.change);
      }
    };
  });
```

```html
<div ng-switch=""switcher"">
  <div ng-switch-when=""a"" on-switch-changed=""doSomethingInParentScope()""></div>
  <div ng-switch-when=""b"" on-switch-changed=""doSomethingInParentScope()""></div>

BREAKING CHANGE (since 1.2.0 and 1.3.0-beta.1):

Angular now requires a `<base>` tag when html5 mode of `$location` is enabled. Reasoning:
Using html5 mode without a `<base href=""..."">` tag makes relative links for images, links, ...
relative to the current url if the browser supports
the history API. However, if the browser does not support the history API Angular falls back to using the `#`,
and then all those relative links would be broken.

The `<base>` tag is also needed when a deep url is loaded from the server, e.g. `http://server/some/page/url`.
In that case, Angular needs to decide which part of the url is the base of the application, and which part
is path inside of the application.

To summarize: Now all relative links are always relative to the `<base>` tag.

Exception (also a breaking change):
Link tags whose `href` attribute starts with a `#` will only change the hash of the url, but nothing else
(e.g. `<a href=""#someAnchor"">`). This is to make it easy to scroll to anchors inside a document.

Related to #6162
Closes #8492

BREAKING CHANGE (since 1.2.17 and 1.3.0-beta.10):

In html5 mode without a `<base>` tag on older browser that don't support the history API
relative paths were adding up. E.g. clicking on `<a href=""page1"">` and then on `<a href=""page2"">`
would produce `$location.path()==='/page1/page2'. The code that introduced this behavior was removed
and Angular now also requires a `<base>` tag to be present when using html5 mode.

It is now possible to ask the $compiler's isolate scope property machinery to bind isolate
scope properties to a controller rather than scope itself. This feature requires the use of
controllerAs, so that the controller-bound properties may still be referenced from binding
expressions in views.

The current syntax is to prefix the scope name with a '@', like so:

    scope: {
        ""myData"": ""=someData"",
        ""myString"": ""@someInterpolation"",
        ""myExpr"": ""&someExpr""
    },
    controllerAs: ""someCtrl"",
    bindtoController: true

The putting of properties within the context of the controller will only occur if
controllerAs is used for an isolate scope with the `bindToController` property of the
directive definition object set to `true`.

`$$addScopeInfo` used to accept either DOM Node or jqLite/jQuery

was a string (the value of the comment) and an exception was thrown."

We run unit tests in “strict” mode and thus can’t monkey-patch `window.location` nor `window.location.reload`. In order to avoid full page reload, we could pass location as argument, or another level of indirection, something like this:
```js
var ourGlobalFunkyLocation = window.location;
function reloadWithDebugInfo() {
  window.name = 'NG_ENABLE_DEBUG_INFO!' + window.name;
  ourGlobalFunkyLocation.reload();
}

// in the test
ourGlobalFunkyLocation = {
  reload: function() {}
};
reloadWithDebugInfo();
ourGlobalFunkyLocation = window.location;
```

I don’t think any of these make sense, just so that we can test setting `window.name`. If the `reloadWithDebugInfo` function was more complicated, I would do it.

I don’t think it’s worthy to confuse production code with extra logic which purpose was only to make testing possible."

errors from occuring from excessive calls to $animate.addClass, $animate.remoteClass
or $animate.setClass.

BREAKING CHANGE

$animate.addClass, $animate.removeClass and $animate.setClass will no longer start the animation
right after being called in the directive code. The animation will only commence once a digest
has passed. This means that all animation-related testing code requires an extra digest to kick
off the animation.

$animate.addClass(element, 'super');
expect(element).toHaveClass('super');

$animate.addClass(element, 'super');

$animate will also tally the amount of times classes are added and removed and only animate
the left over classes once the digest kicks in. This means that for any directive code that
adds and removes the same CSS class on the same element then this may result in no animation
being triggered at all.

```js
$animate.addClass(element, 'klass');
$animate.removeClass(element, 'klass');

Via transclusion, svg elements can occur outside an `<svg>` container in an
Angular template but are put into an `<svg>` container through compilation
and linking.

E.g.
Given that `svg-container` is a transcluding directive with
the following template:
```
<svg ng-transclude></svg>
```

The following markup creates a `<circle>` inside of an `<svg>` element
during runtime:
```
<svg-container>
  <circle></circle>
</svg-container>
```

However, this produces non working `<circle>` elements, as svg elements
need to be created inside of an `<svg>` element.

This change detects for most cases the correct namespace of transcluded content
and recreates that content in the correct `<svg>` container
when needed during compilation. For special cases it adds an addition argument
to `$transclude` that allows to specify the future parent node of elements
that will be cloned and attached using the `cloneAttachFn`.

allOrNothing interpolation is now used for ng-attr-*, under all circumstances. This prevents
uninitialized attributes from being added to the DOM with invalid values which cause errors
to be shown.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Now, ng-attr-* will never add the attribute to the DOM if any of the interpolated expressions
evaluate to `undefined`.

To work around this, initialize values which are intended to be the empty string with the
empty string:

For example, given the following markup:

    <div ng-attr-style=""border-radius: {{value}}{{units}}""></div>

If $scope.value is `4`, and $scope.units is undefined, the resulting markup is unchanged:

    <div ng-attr-style=""border-radius: {{value}}{{units}}""></div>

However, if $scope.units is `""""`, then the resulting markup is updated:

It is now possible to ask the $compiler's isolate scope property machinery to bind isolate
scope properties to a controller rather than scope itself. This feature requires the use of
controllerAs, so that the controller-bound properties may still be referenced from binding
expressions in views.

The current syntax is to prefix the scope name with a '@', like so:

    scope: {
        ""myData"": ""=someData"",
        ""myString"": ""@someInterpolation"",
        ""myExpr"": ""&someExpr""
    },
    controllerAs: ""someCtrl"",
    bindtoController: true

The putting of properties within the context of the controller will only occur if
controllerAs is used for an isolate scope with the `bindToController` property of the
directive definition object set to `true`.

It's a bad practice for filters to have hidden dependencies, so pulling stuff from scope directly
is not a good idea. Scope being the filter context was never documented as public api, so we don't
expect that any significant code depends on this behavior.

If an existing filter has a dependency on the scope instance, the scope reference can
be passed into the filter as a filter argument (this is highly discouraged for new code):

The change unfortunatelly makes us incompatible with jQuery which always falls back to onLoad.

Not falling back to onLoad is a possible breaking change because if Angular was added to the document during DOMContentLoaded
document.readyState at this point is 'interactive' which we'd need to add to our check, but more importantly if more scripts
are added during DOMContentLoaded these won't be loaded before we bootstrap, which can cause angular modules not to be found
during bootstrap.

This load ordering issues is really just a cornercase that should be handled via manual bootstrap, but until jQuery has the same
behavior we shouldn't do something else."

In some scenarios you want to be able to specify properties on the event
that is passed to the event handler. JQuery does this by overloading the
first parameter (`eventName`). If it is an object with a `type` property
then we assume that it must be a custom event.

In this case the custom event must provide the `type` property which is
the name of the event to be triggered.  `triggerHandler` will continue to
provide dummy default functions for `preventDefault()`, `isDefaultPrevented()`
and `stopPropagation()` but you may override these with your own versions
in your custom object if you wish.

In addition the commit provides some performance and memory usage
improvements by only creating objects and doing work that is necessary.

This commit also renames the parameters inline with jQuery.

The data jQuery method was re-implemented in 2.0 in a secure way. This made
current hacky Angular solution to move data between elements via changing the

data from the first element to the other one.

Testing cache leaks on jQuery 2.x is not possible in the same way as it's done
in jqLite or in jQuery 1.x as there is no publicly exposed data storage. One
way to test it would be to intercept all places where a jQuery object is created
to save a reference to the underlaying node but there is no single place in the
jQuery code through which all element creation passes (there are various
shortcuts for performance reasons). Instead we rely on jqLite.cache testing
to find potential data leaks.

Some servers require characters within path segments to contain semicolons,
such as `/;jsessionid=foo` in order to work correctly. RFC-3986 includes
semicolons as acceptable sub-delimiters inside of path and query, but $location
currently encodes semicolons. This can cause an infinite digest to occur since $location
is comparing the internal semicolon-encoded url with the semicolon-unencoded url returned
from window.location.href, causing Angular to believe the url is changing with each digest
loop.

This fix adds "";"" to the list of characters to unencode after encoding queries or path segments.

Previously we defaulted just to A because of IE8 which had a hard time with applying css styles to HTMLUnknownElements.

This is no longer the case with IE9, so we should make restrict default to EA. Doing so will make it easier to create
components and avoid matching errors when creating new directives

BREAKING CHANGE: directives now match elements by default unless specific restriction rules are set via `restrict` property.

This means that if a directive 'myFoo' previously didn't specify matching restrictrion, it will now match both the attribute
and element form.

Before:

 <div my-foo></div> <---- my-foo attribute matched the directive
 <my-foo></my-foo>  <---- no match

After:

 <div my-foo></div> <---- my-foo attribute matched the directive
 <my-foo></my-foo>  <---- my-foo element matched the directive

It is not expected that this will be a problem in practice because of widespread use of prefixes that make ""<my-foo>"" like
elements unlikely.

If an ngSwitchWhen or ngSwitchDefault directive is on an element that also
contains a transclusion directive (such as ngRepeat) the new scope should
be the one provided by the bound transclusion function.

Previously we were incorrectly creating a simple child of the main ngSwitch
scope.

BREAKING CHANGE:
** Directive Priority Changed ** - this commit changes the priority
of `ngSwitchWhen` and `ngSwitchDefault` from 800 to 1200.  This makes their
priority higher than `ngRepeat`, which allows items to be repeated on
the switch case element reliably.

In general your directives should have a lower priority than these directives
if you want them to exist inside the case elements. If you relied on the
priority of these directives then you should check that your code still
operates correctly.

lead to inconsistent behaviour and would be much more complex to support.

you can implement your own version of this directive for you application.

single-element directives.

BREAKING CHANGE: Directives which previously depended on the implicit grouping between
directive-start and directive-end attributes must be refactored in order to see this same behaviour.

With the exception of simple demos, it is not helpful to use globals
for controller constructors. This adds a new method to `$controllerProvider`
to re-enable the old behavior, but disables this feature by default.

BREAKING CHANGE:
`$controller` will no longer look for controllers on `window`.
The old behavior of looking on `window` for controllers was originally intended
for use in examples, demos, and toy apps. We found that allowing global controller
functions encouraged poor practices, so we resolved to disable this behavior by
default.

To migrate, register your controllers with modules rather than exposing them
as globals:

Before:

```javascript
function MyController() {
  // ...
}
```

After:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', []).controller('MyController', [function() {
  // ...
}]);
```

Although it's not recommended, you can re-enable the old behavior like this:

```javascript
angular.module('myModule').config(['$controllerProvider', function($controllerProvider) {
  // this option might be handy for migrating old apps, but please don't use it
  // in new ones!
  $controllerProvider.allowGlobals();
}]);
```"

So far, angular.copy was copying all properties including those from
prototype chain and was losing the whole prototype chain (except for Date,
Regexp, and Array).

Deep copy should exclude properties from the prototype chain because it
is useless to do so. When modified, properties from prototype chain are
overwritten on the object itself and will be deeply copied then.

Moreover, preserving prototype chain allows instanceof operator to be
consistent between the source object and the copy.
Before this change,

    var Foo = function() {};
    var foo = new Foo();
    var fooCopy = angular.copy(foo);
    foo instanceof Foo; // => true
    fooCopy instanceof Foo; // => false

Now,

    foo instanceof Foo; // => true
    fooCopy instanceof Foo; // => true

The new behaviour is useful when using $http transformResponse. When
receiving JSON data, we could transform it and instantiate real object
""types"" from it. The transformed response is always copied by Angular.
The old behaviour was losing the whole prototype chain and broke all
""types"" from third-party libraries depending on instanceof.

Closes #5063
Closes #3767
Closes #4996

BREAKING CHANGE:

This changes `angular.copy` so that it applies the prototype of the original
object to the copied object.  Previously, `angular.copy` would copy properties
of the original object's prototype chain directly onto the copied object.

This means that if you iterate over only the copied object's `hasOwnProperty`
properties, it will no longer contain the properties from the prototype.
This is actually much more reasonable behaviour and it is unlikely that
applications are actually relying on this.

If this behaviour is relied upon, in an app, then one should simply iterate
over all the properties on the object (and its inherited properties) and
not filter them with `hasOwnProperty`.

**Be aware that this change also uses a feature that is not compatible with
IE8.**  If you need this to work on IE8 then you would need to provide a polyfill
for `Object.create` and `Object.getPrototypeOf`."

$evalAsync triggers a digest, and is unsuitable when it is expected that a digest should not occur.

BREAKING CHANGE

Previously, even if invokeApply was set to false, a $rootScope digest would occur during promise
resolution. This is no longer the case, as promises returned from $timeout and $interval will no
longer trigger $evalAsync (which in turn causes a $digest) if `invokeApply` is false.

Workarounds include manually triggering $scope.$apply(), or returning $q.defer().promise from a
promise callback, and resolving or rejecting it when appropriate.

    var interval = $interval(function() {
      if (someRequirementFulfilled) {
        $interval.cancel(interval);
        $scope.$apply();
      }
    }, 100, 0, false);

or:

    var interval = $interval(function (idx) {
      // make the magic happen
    }, 1000, 10, false);
    interval.then(function(idx) {
      var deferred = $q.defer();

Thanks to lgalfaso for test ideas.

Change HashMap to give $$hashKey also for functions so it will be possible to load multiple module

to maintain its own id counter and added cleanup of $$hashKey from all module functions after each
test.

Before this CL, functions were added to the HashMap via toString(), which could potentially return
the same value for different actual instances of a function. This corrects this behaviour by
ensuring that functions are mapped with hashKeys, and ensuring that hashKeys are removed from
functions and objects at the end of tests.

In addition to these changes, the injector uses its own set of UIDs in order to prevent confusingly
breaking tests which expect scopes or ng-repeated items to have specific hash keys.

Previously non-object literals would be thrown out of Resource responses with isArray===true, or
otherwise converted into Objects (in the case of string literals). The reason for this is because
shallowClearAndCopy iterates over keys, and copies keys into the destination. Iterating over String
keys results in integer keys, with a single-character value.

Not converting non-objects to Resources means that you lose the ability to perform Resource operations
on them. However, they become usable as strings, numbers, or booleans, which is important.

In the future, it would be useful to make these useful as Resources while still retaining their primitive
value usefulness.

is unjustified because even if an app was to create lots of scopes non-stop,

When the pattern and ng-pattern attributes are used with an input element
containing a ngModel directive then they should both use the same validator
and the validation errors of the model should be placed on model.$error.pattern.

BREAKING CHANGE:

If an expression is used on ng-pattern (such as `ng-pattern=""exp""`) or on the
pattern attribute (something like on `pattern=""{{ exp }}""`) and the expression
itself evaluates to a string then the validator will not parse the string as a
literal regular expression object (a value like `/abc/i`).  Instead, the entire
string will be created as the regular expression to test against. This means
that any expression flags will not be placed on the RegExp object. To get around
this limitation, use a regular expression object as the value for the expression.

Previously, the compiler would throw an error if a directive requested new non-isolate scope
after a directive had requested isolate scope. But it would not error if a directive
requested an isolate scope after a directive had requested a new non-isolate scope.

Since it is invalid to have more than one directive request any kind of scope if one of
them has requested isolate scope, then the compiler should error whatever order the
directives are applied.

This fix addresses this situation by throwing error regardless of order of directives.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Requesting isolate scope and any other scope on a single element is an error.
Before this change, the compiler let two directives request a child scope
and an isolate scope if the compiler applied them in the order of non-isolate
scope directive followed by isolate scope directive.

Now the compiler will error regardless of the order.

If you find that your code is now throwing a `$compile:multidir` error,
check that you do not have directives on the same element that are trying
to request both an isolate and a non-isolate scope and fix your code.

1. The example doesn't actually attempt to use $window in a expression. It's in a
   function called from an expression, which incorrectly implies to readers that:
  1. functions ARE expressions
  1. functions called by expressions can't access `window`

Here's [a plunkr](http://plnkr.co/edit/Gd4xAV?p=preview) to make both these issues clear.

This change fixes the errors and informs the reader about Angular's `$window` etc services,

that binding follows is that the binding will take the first

Watchers from $watch, $watchCollection and $watchGroup will
automatically stop watching when the expression(s) are bind-once
and fulfill.

Watchers from text and attributes interpolations will
automatically stop watching when the expressions are fulfill.

All directives that use $parse for expressions will automatically
work with bind-once expressions. E.g.

Place phoneId binding in a proper HTML node

The code where the phoneId binding in the phone-detail.html template is first explained in step 7
of the tutorial doesn't make it a child of a proper HTML node, which makes the end-to-end test
against the view (also introduced in step 7) fail.

The test acquires the binding right from the view (by.binding('phoneId')), and apparently this
operation fails when the binding is not a child of an HTML node, and therefore the entire test also
fails. As soon as the binding is placed inside a <span></span> tag pair, the binding is found and
the test passes. The code on github for step 7 has it right, the binding is within the span tags,
but in the documentation I'm patching here the span's are missing.

BREAKING CHANGE:

The `replace` flag for defining directives that
replace the element that they are on will be removed in the next
major angular version.
This feature has difficult semantics (e.g. how attributes are merged)
and leads to more problems compared to what it solves.
Also, with WebComponents it is normal to have custom elements in the DOM."

When a event is finished propagating through Scope hierarchy the event's `currentScope` property
should be reset to `null` to avoid accidental use of this property in asynchronous event handlers.

In the previous code, the event's property would contain a reference to the last Scope instance that
was visited during the traversal, which is unlikely what the code trying to grab scope reference expects.

BREAKING CHANGE: $broadcast and $emit will now reset the `currentScope` property of the event to
null once the event finished propagating. If any code depends on asynchronously accessing thei
`currentScope` property, it should be migrated to use `targetScope` instead. All of these cases
should be considered programming bugs.

This CL enables interpolation expressions to be escaped, by prefixing each character of their
start/end markers with a REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C, and to render the escaped expression as a
regular interpolation expression.

Example:

`<span ng-init=""foo='Hello'"">{{foo}}, \\{\\{World!\\}\\}</span>` would be rendered as:
`<span ng-init=""foo='Hello'"">Hello, {{World!}}</span>`

This will also work with custom interpolation markers, for example:

     module.
       config(function($interpolateProvider) {
         $interpolateProvider.startSymbol('\\\\');
         $interpolateProvider.endSymbol('//');
       }).
       run(function($interpolate) {
         // Will alert with ""hello\\bar//"":
         alert($interpolate('\\\\foo//\\\\\\\\bar\\/\\/')({foo: ""hello"", bar: ""world""}));
       });

This change effectively only changes the rendering of these escaped markers, because they are
not context-aware, and are incapable of preventing nested expressions within those escaped
markers from being evaluated.

Therefore, backends are encouraged to ensure that when escaping expressions for security
reasons, every single instance of a start or end marker have each of its characters prefixed
with a backslash (REVERSE SOLIDUS, U+005C)

Currently Angular monkey-patches a few jQuery methods that remove elements
from the DOM. Since methods like .remove() have multiple signatures
that can change what's actually removed, Angular needs to carefully
repeat them in its patching or it can break apps using jQuery correctly.
Such a strategy is also not future-safe.

Instead of patching individual methods on the prototype, it's better to
hook into jQuery.cleanData and trigger custom events there. This should be
safe as e.g. jQuery UI needs it and uses it. It'll also be future-safe.

The only drawback is that $destroy is no longer triggered when using $detach
but:

  1. Angular doesn't use this method, jqLite doesn't implement it.
  2. Detached elements can be re-attached keeping all their events & data
     so it makes sense that $destroy is not triggered on them.
  3. The approach from this commit is so much safer that any issues with
     .detach() working differently are outweighed by the robustness of the code.

BREAKING CHANGE: the $destroy event is no longer triggered when using the
jQuery detach() method. If you want to destroy Angular data attached to the
element, use remove()."

Move responsibility for pending and debouncing model updates into `NgModelController`.
Now input directives are only responsible for capturing changes to the input element's
value and then calling `$setViewValue` with the new value.

Calls to `$setViewValue(value)` change the `$viewValue` property but these changes are
not committed to the `$modelValue` until an `updateOn` trigger occurs (and any related
`debounce` has resolved).

The `$$lastCommittedViewValue` is now stored when `$setViewValue(value)` updates
the `$viewValue`, which allows the view to be ""reset"" by calling `$rollbackViewValue()`.

The new `$commitViewValue()` method allows developers to force the `$viewValue` to be
committed through to the `$modelValue` immediately, ignoring `updateOn` triggers and
`debounce` delays.

BREAKING CHANGE:

This commit changes the API on `NgModelController`, both semantically and
in terms of adding and renaming methods.

* `$setViewValue(value)` -
This method still changes the `$viewValue` but does not immediately commit this
change through to the `$modelValue` as it did previously.
Now the value is committed only when a trigger specified in an associated
`ngModelOptions` directive occurs. If `ngModelOptions` also has a `debounce` delay
specified for the trigger then the change will also be debounced before being
committed.
In most cases this should not have a significant impact on how `NgModelController`
is used: If `updateOn` includes `default` then `$setViewValue` will trigger
a (potentially debounced) commit immediately.
* `$cancelUpdate()` - is renamed to `$rollbackViewValue()` and has the same meaning,
which is to revert the current `$viewValue` back to the `$lastCommittedViewValue`,
to cancel any pending debounced updates and to re-render the input.

To migrate code that used `$cancelUpdate()` follow the example below:

Before:

```
  $scope.resetWithCancel = function (e) {
    if (e.keyCode == 27) {
      $scope.myForm.myInput1.$cancelUpdate();
      $scope.myValue = '';
    }
  };
```

After:

```
  $scope.resetWithCancel = function (e) {
    if (e.keyCode == 27) {
      $scope.myForm.myInput1.$rollbackViewValue();
      $scope.myValue = '';
    }
  }
```"

Input controls require `ngModel` which in turn brings in the `ngModelOptions`
but since ngModel does this initialization in the post link function, the
order in which the directives are run is relevant.

Directives are sorted by priority and name but `ngModel`, `input` and `textarea`
have the same priority. It just happens that `textarea` is alphabetically
sorted and so linked before `ngModel` (unlike `input`).

This is a problem since inputs expect `ngModelController.$options`
to exist at post-link time and for `textarea` this has not happened.

This is solved easily by moving the initialization of `ngModel` to the
pre-link function.

This change ensures that a module's config blocks are always invoked after all of its providers are
registered.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, config blocks would be able to control behaviour of provider registration, due to being
invoked prior to provider registration. Now, provider registration always occurs prior to configuration
for a given module, and therefore config blocks are not able to have any control over a providers
registration.

Example:

Previously, the following:

   angular.module('foo', [])
     .provider('$rootProvider', function() {
       this.$get = function() { ... }
     })
     .config(function($rootProvider) {
       $rootProvider.dependentMode = ""B"";
     })
     .provider('$dependentProvider', function($rootProvider) {
       if ($rootProvider.dependentMode === ""A"") {
         this.$get = function() {
           // Special mode!
         }
       } else {
         this.$get = function() {
           // something else
         }
       }
     });

would have ""worked"", meaning behaviour of the config block between the registration of ""$rootProvider""
and ""$dependentProvider"" would have actually accomplished something and changed the behaviour of the
app. This is no longer possible within a single module.

Code cleanup! response interceptors have been deprecated for some time, and it is confusing to have
two APIs, one of which is slightly ""hidden"" and hard to see, which perform the same task. The newer
API is a bit cleaner and more visible, so this is naturally preferred.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, it was possible to register a response interceptor like so:

    // register the interceptor as a service
    $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
      return function(promise) {
        return promise.then(function(response) {
          // do something on success
          return response;
        }, function(response) {
          // do something on error
          if (canRecover(response)) {
            return responseOrNewPromise
          }
          return $q.reject(response);
        });
      }
    });

    $httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');

Now, one must use the newer API introduced in v1.1.4 (4ae46814), like so:

    $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q) {
      return {
        response: function(response) {
          // do something on success
          return response;
        },
        responseError: function(response) {
          // do something on error
          if (canRecover(response)) {
            return responseOrNewPromise
          }
          return $q.reject(response);
        }
      };
    });

    $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');

The previous solution for opening Plunkers from the docs relied on tight
coupling between the docs site and the plunkr site, in particular the
URL to the example code on the docs server was hard coded in the Plunker
site.

This change goes back to the old POST method of creating a Plunker, but
with a subtle difference: In the very old docs, the content was injected
directly into the example HTML at build time.  This was easy enough to
do as the example actually ran in the current page but also increased
the size of the doc page.

The new examples are run in completely separate iframes. This new version
of showing a Plunker loads the file content for the Plunker from the

This modifies the injector to prevent automatic annotation from occurring for a given injector.

This behaviour can be enabled when bootstrapping the application by using the attribute
""ng-strict-di"" on the root element (the element containing ""ng-app""), or alternatively by passing
an object with the property ""strictDi"" set to ""true"" in angular.bootstrap, when bootstrapping
manually.

JS example:

    angular.module(""name"", [""dependencies"", ""otherdeps""])
      .provider(""$willBreak"", function() {
        this.$get = function($rootScope) {
        };
      })
      .run([""$willBreak"", function($willBreak) {
        // This block will never run because the noMagic flag was set to true,
        // and the $willBreak '$get' function does not have an explicit
        // annotation.
      }]);

    angular.bootstrap(document, [""name""], {
      strictDi: true
    });

HTML:

    <html ng-app=""name"" ng-strict-di>
      <!-- ... -->
    </html>

This will only affect functions with an arity greater than 0, and without an $inject property.

By default, any change to an input will trigger an immediate model update,
form validation and run a $digest. This is not always desirable, especially
when you have a large number of bindings to update.

This PR implements a new directive `ngModelOptions`, which allow you to
override this default behavior in several ways. It is implemented as an
attribute, to which you pass an Angular expression, which evaluates to an
**options** object.

All inputs, using ngModel, will search for this directive in their ancestors
and use it if found.  This makes it easy to provide options for a whole
form or even the whole page, as well as specifying exceptions for
individual inputs.

* You can specify what events trigger an update to the model by providing
  an `updateOn` property on the **options** object. This property takes a
  string containing a space separated list of events.

  For example, `ng-model-options=""{ updateOn: 'blur' }""` will update the
  model only after the input loses focus.

  There is a special pseudo-event, called ""default"", which maps to the
  default event used by the input box normally. This is useful if you
  want to keep the default behavior and just add new events.

* You can specify a debounce delay, how long to wait after the last triggering
  event before updating the model, by providing a `debounce` property on
  the **options** object.

  This property can be a simple number, the
  debounce delay for all events. For example,
  `ng-model-options=""{ debounce: 500 }"" will ensure the model is updated
  only when there has been a period 500ms since the last triggering event.

  The property can also be an object, where the keys map to events and
  the values are a corresponding debounce delay for that event.
  This can be useful to force immediate updates on some specific
  circumstances (like blur events). For example,
  `ng-model-options=""{ updateOn: 'default blur', debounce: { default: 500, blur: 0} }""`

This commit also brings to an end one of the longest running Pull Requests
in the history of AngularJS (#2129)!  A testament to the patience of @lrlopez.

With 1.2.x, `$animate.enter` and `$animate.move` both insert the element at the end of the provided
parent container element when only the `parent` element is provided. If an `after` element is provided
then they will place the inserted element after that one. This works fine, but there is no way to
place an item at the top of the provided parent container using these two APIs.

With this change, if the `after` argument is not specified for either `$animate.enter` or `$animate.move`,
the new child element will be inserted into the first position of the parent container element.

Closes #6275

BREAKING CHANGE: $animate will no longer default the after parameter to the last element of the parent
container. Instead, when after is not specified, the new element will be inserted as the first child of
the parent container.

To update existing code, change all instances of `$animate.enter()` or `$animate.move()` from:

`$animate.enter(element, parent);`

to:

`$animate.enter(element, parent, angular.element(parent[0].lastChild));`"

The default CSS driver in ngAnimate directly uses node.className when reading
the CSS class string on the given element. While this works fine with standard
HTML DOM elements, SVG elements have their own DOM property. By switching to use
node.getAttribute, ngAnimate can extract the element's className value without
throwing an exception.

When using jQuery over jqLite, ngAnimate will not properly handle SVG elements
for an animation. This is because jQuery doesn't process SVG elements within it's
DOM operation code by default. To get this to work, simply include the jquery.svg.js
JavaScript file into your application.

Due to a known V8 memory leak[1] we need to perform extra cleanup to make it easier
for GC to collect this scope object.

V8 leaks are due to strong references from optimized code (fixed in M34) and inline
caches (fix in works). Inline caches are caches that the virtual machine builds on the
fly to speed up property access for javascript objects. These caches contain strong
references to objects so under certain conditions this can create a leak.

The reason why these leaks are extra bad for Scope instances is that scopes hold on
to ton of stuff, so when a single scope leaks, it makes a ton of other stuff leak.

This change removes references to objects that might be holding other big
objects. This means that even if the destroyed scope leaks, the child scopes
should not leak because we are not explicitly holding onto them.

Additionally in  theory we should also help make the current scope eligible for GC
by changing properties of the current Scope object.

I was able to manually verify that this fixes the problem for the following
example app: http://plnkr.co/edit/FrSw6SCEVODk02Ljo8se

Given the nature of the problem I'm not 100% sure that this will work around
the V8 problem in scenarios common for Angular apps, but I guess it's better
than nothing.

This is a second attempt to enhance the cleanup, the first one failed  and was
reverted because it was too aggressive and caused problems for existing apps.

Due to a known V8 memory leak[1] we need to perform extra cleanup to make it easier
for GC to collect this scope object.

The theory is that the V8 leaks are due to inline caches which are caches
built on the fly to speed up property access for javascript objects.

By cleaning the scope object and removing all properties, we clean up ICs
as well and so no leaks occur.

I was able to manually verify that this fixes the problem for the following
example app: http://plnkr.co/edit/FrSw6SCEVODk02Ljo8se?p=preview

Given the nature of the problem I'm not 100% sure that this will work around
the V8 problem in scenarios common for Angular apps, but I guess it's better
than nothing.

$animate attempts places a `transition: none 0s` block on the element when
the first CSS class is applied if a transition animation is underway. This
works fine for structural animations (enter, leave and move), however, for
class-based animations, this poses a big problem. As of this patch, instead
of $animate placing the block, it is now the responsibility of the user to
place `transition: 0s none` into their class-based transition setup CSS class.
This way the animation will avoid all snapping and any will allow $animate to
play nicely with class-based transitions that are defined outside of ngAnimate.

Closes #6674
Closes #6739

BREAKING CHANGE: Any class-based animation code that makes use of transitions
and uses the setup CSS classes (such as class-add and class-remove) must now
provide a empty transition value to ensure that its styling is applied right
away. In other words if your animation code is expecting any styling to be
applied that is defined in the setup class then it will not be applied
""instantly"" default unless a `transition:0s none` value is present in the styling
for that CSS class. This situation is only the case if a transition is already
present on the base CSS class once the animation kicks off."
matsko,2014-03-21 23:07:58,https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/git/commits/2317af68510fe3b67526282dad697ad4dc621a19,2317af68510fe3b67526282dad697ad4dc621a19,"fix($animate): run CSS animations before JS animations to avoid style inheritance

If a JS animation is run before a CSS animation then the JS animation may end up writing style
data to the element. If any transition or animation style data is written then it may end up
being accidentally inherited into the CSS animation hanlder that ngAnimate uses. This may result
in an unexpected outcome due to the tweaks and hacks that the CSS handler places on the element.
If the CSS animation is run before the JS animation then, if there are no transitions on the style
attribute nor within the global CSS on the page then nothing will happen and the JS animation can
work as expected.

$watchCollection checks if oldValue !== newValue which does not work for NaN. This was causing

This fix adds a simple check to see if the current value and previous value are both NaN, and
if so, does not count it as a change.

This change brings Angular's JSONP behaviour closer in line with jQuery's. It will no longer treat
a callback called with no data as an error, and will no longer support IE8 via the onreadystatechanged
event.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, the JSONP backend code would support IE8 by relying on the readystatechanged events. This
is no longer the case, as these events do not provide adequate useful information for deeming whether
or not a response is an error.

Previously, a JSONP response which did not pass data into the callback would be given a status of -2,
and treated as an error. Now, this situation will instead be given a status of 200, despite the lack
of data. This is useful for interaction with certain APIs.

Previously, the onload and onerror callbacks were added to the JSONP script tag. These have been
replaced with jQuery events, in order to gain access to the event object. This means that it is now
difficult to test if the callbacks are registered or not. This is possible with jQuery, using the
$.data(""events"") method, however it is currently impossible with jqLite. This is not expected to
break applications.

In order to make the behavior compatible with $rootScope.$watch and $rootScope.$on methods, and
make it possible to deregister an attribute observer, Attributes.$observe method now returns a
deregistration function instead of the observer itself.

BREAKING CHANGE: calling attr.$observe no longer returns the observer function, but a
    deregistration function instead.

    To migrate the code follow the example below:

    Before:

```
    directive('directiveName', function() {
      return {
        link: function(scope, elm, attr) {
          var observer = attr.$observe('someAttr', function(value) {

          });
        }
      };
    });
```

    After:

```
    directive('directiveName', function() {
      return {
        link: function(scope, elm, attr) {
          var observer = function(value) {
            console.log(value);
          };

Originally we destroyed the oldValue by incrementaly copying over portions of the newValue
into the oldValue during dirty-checking, this resulted in oldValue to be equal to newValue
by the time we called the watchCollection listener.

The fix creates a copy of the newValue each time a change is detected and then uses that
copy *the next time* a change is detected.

To make `$watchCollection` behave the same way as `$watch`, during the first iteration
the listener is called with newValue and oldValue being identical.

Since many of the corner-cases are already covered by existing tests, I refactored the
test logging to include oldValue and made the tests more readable.

We need to be able to build angular at older shas, without the lock file / shrinkwrap file
the dependencies will resolve differently on different machines and at different times.

This will help us avoid broken builds and hard to track down issues.

I had to manually edit this file after it was generated because `npm shrinkwrap` will install
optional dependencies as if they were hard dependencies.

See: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2679#issuecomment-37361236

My manual edit:

```

```

Additionally chokidar doesn't list the dependencies above as optional, but that will hopefully
be soon fixed: https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar/pull/106

In the meantime the patch from the PR above needs to be applied to
node_modules/karma/node_modules/chokidar/package.json before running `npm shrinkwrap`

----

After this change is applied, angular core developers don't need to do anything differently,
except when updating dependencies we need to call `npm update && npm shrinkwrap --dev`
followed by reappling my patch above until npm's bug.

Transitions must be blocked so that the initial CSS class can be applied
without triggering an animation. Keyframes do not need to be blocked since
animations are always triggered on the starting CSS class, however, if a
stagger animation is set to occur then all elements for index > 0 should
be blocked. This is to prevent the animation from occuring early on before
the stagger delay for the given element has passed.

With ngAnimate and keyframe animations, IE10 and Safari will render a slight
flicker effect caused by the blocking. This fix resolves this issue.

This reverts commit cad717b1171affc3d540cea372576c70b0cb2295.

This change causes regressions in existing code and after closer inspection
I realized that it is trying to fix an issue that is should not be considered
a valid issue.

The location service was designed to work against either ""hash"" part of the
window.location when in the hashbang mode or full url when in the html5 mode.

This change tries to merge the two modes partially, which is not right. One
reason for this is that the search part of window.location can't be modified
while in the hashbang mode (a browser limitation), so with this change part
of the search object should be immutable and read-only which will only cause
more confusion.

this results in the invalid state of the input being ignored and considered valid.

It is problematic to use {@link} tags with external links because the
markdown parser converts them to links for us before we parse the @links.
This means that the following tag:

```
{@link http://www.google.com Google}
```

get converted to:

```
{@link <a href=""http://www.google.com/""></a> Google}
```

Our {@link} parser then converts this to:

```
<a href=""<a"">&lt;</a>href=""http://www.google.com/""></a> Google}
```

which is clearly a mess.  The best solution is not to use {@link} tags
for external links and just use the standard markdown syntax:

```
[Google](http://www.google.com)
```

In the long run, we could look into configuring or modifying `marked` not
to convert these external links or we could provide a ""pre-parser""
processor that dealt with such links before `marked` gets its hands on it."

This corrects a complicated compiler issue, described in detail below:

Previously, if an element transclusion directive contained an asynchronous directive whose template
contained another element transclusion directive, the inner element transclusion directive would be
linked with the element, rather than the expected comment node.

An example manifestation of this bug would look like so:

```html
<div ng-repeat=""i in [1,2,3,4,5]"">
  <div my-directive>
  </div>
</div>
```

`my-directive` would be a replace directive, and its template would contain another element
transclusion directive, like so:

```html
<div ng-if=""true"">{{i}}</div>
```

ngIf would be linked with this template content, rather than the comment node, and the template element
would be attached to the DOM, rather than the comment. As a result, this caused ng-if to duplicate the
template when its expression evaluated to true.

An infinite $digest loop can be caused by expressions that invoke a promise.
The problem is that $digest does not decrement ttl unless it finds dirty changes;
it should check also if asyncQueue is empty.
Generally the condition for decrementing ttl should be the same as the
condition for terminating the $digest loop.

This reverts commit 63cd873fef3207deef30c7a7ed66f4b8f647dc12.

The change breaks existing tests of Google apps. The problem is that
while we tried to avoid adding #/ to window.location.href unnecessarily
we failed doing so. Likely because by setting $path, at some point
(during a digest) we try to check if $location changed and we mistake the
default '/' with an explicit settign of the path via the `path()` method.
This results in us writing the url with '#/' into $browser.url() which updates
the window.location by adding ""#/"" to the url - something we tried to avoid
in the first place.

I'll reopen PR #5712."

When you cancel a JSONP request, angular deletes the callback for it.

Recent browsers, particularly PhantomJS 1.9.2 and Safari 7.0
treat the stack property as non-configurable and unwritable.

Because window.inject captures the stack at the time of the inject,
and attempts to insert it into a captured throw from the injected
function by modifying e.stack, a meaningless error message and
stack is thrown instead.

This commit inserts two tests exposing the problem, and implements
a proposed solution that builds a new error-like object that mimicks
the old Error object, but with the additional stack information, and
captures the toString function from the Error object prototype.  This
appears to work for the browsers suppoerted here."

It is essential that users of `$interval` destroy the interval when they are finished.
Otherwise you can get memory leaks.
Often `$intervals` are used in directives or controllers and developers don't think
about what happens when the component is destroyed.
If a directive/controller scope is destroyed, then the $interval should be destroyed as well.
This could cause some issues with developers who assume that the interval will be cleared

End 2 end tests wait for all `$timeout`s to be run before completing the test.
This was problematic where we were using timeouts that restarted themselves because
there would never be a point when all timeouts had completed, causing the tests to hang.

To fix this $timeout had been monkey-patched but this caused other issue itself.

Now that we have $interval we don't need to use $timeout handlers that re-trigger the $timeout
so we can ditch the monkey-patch.

This commit tidies up any examples that are using this approach and changes them to use $interval
instead.

This means any watches that watch form or model controller changes

When using two-way binding with isolate scope, under some circumstances
the lastValue variable captured in the parentValueWatch function can get
out of sync.

Specifically, if both the value in the origin scope as well as the value
in the isolate scope get independently updated to the same value within
one digest cycle, the lastValue is never updated. This potentially causes
the watch to make the wrong decision as to which side to update on subsequent
passes.

This fixes things by ensuring lastValue is always set to the last seen
value even if the watch's logic was short circuited because there was no
difference between the values in the original and isolate scopes.

In Safari 7 (and other browsers potentially using the latest YARR JIT library)
regular expressions are not always executed immediately that they are called.
The regex is only evaluated (lazily) when you first access properties on the `matches`
result object returned from the regex call.

In the case of `decodeEntities()`, we were updating this returned object, `parts[0] = ''`,
before accessing it, `if (parts[2])', and so our change was overwritten by the result
of executing the regex.

The solution here is not to modify the match result object at all. We only need to make use
of the three match results directly in code.

Developers should be aware, in the future, when using regex, to read from the result object
before making modifications to it.

There is no additional test committed here, because when run against Safari 7, this
bug caused numerous specs to fail, which are all fixed by this commit.

IE8, IE9 and IE10 can use `script.onreadystate` so up till now we have been using this
if the sniffer says we are on IE.
But IE11 now does not support `script.onreadystate` and only supports the more standard
`script.onload` and `script.onerror`.
IE9 and IE10 do support `script.onload` and `script.onerror`. So now we only test whether
we are on IE8 or earlier before using `script.onreadystate`.
See http://pieisgood.org/test/script-link-events/

jQuery just uses all these handlers at once and hopes for the best, but since IE9 and IE10
support both sets of handlers, this could cause the handlers to be run more than once.

jQuery also notes that there is a potential memory leak in IE unless we remove the handlers
from the script object once they are run.  So we are doing this too, now.

In 1.2, the behavior of ngInclude was modified to use DOM APIs rather than jqLite. This means that
even when jQuery was loaded, ngInclude was not calling into it, and thus scripts were not eval'd
as they had been before. Although the use of ngInclude to eval scripts as a lazy-loading strategy
was never an intentional feature, this patch restores the ability to do so.

Prior to this fix, the urlResolve method would automatically
strip the first segment of a path if the segment ends in a colon.
This was to correct undesired behavior in the $location service
using the file protocol on windows in multiple browsers (see #4680).

However, there could be cases where users intentionally 
have first path segments that end in a colon 
(although this conflicts with section 3.3 of rfc3986).

The solution to this problem is an extra check to make sure
the first path segment of the input url does not end with a colon,
to make sure we're only removing undesired path segments.

Although demo apps run in an isolated environment, we need to be able to tell them to disable
animations when we are running end-to-end tests.  By sharing the same instance of $animate
between the two environments we can disable animation across the board.

The $animate service uses the $$postDigestQueue to run animations.  The outer $animate
service uses the outer $$postDigestQueue and to queue up these animations.  This means that
when we run a digest inside the embedded scope, the animations are never performed - they
just sit in the outer scope's queue and are only run when a digest is run on the outer scope.
By sharing this queue across the two scopes the animations are performed correctly."

Fixes issue with isolate scope leaking all over the place into other directives on the same element.

Isolate scope is now available only to the isolate directive that requested it and its template.

A non-isolate directive should not get the isolate scope of an isolate directive on the same element,
instead they will receive the original scope (which is the parent scope of the newly created isolate scope).

Paired with Tobias.

BREAKING CHANGE: Directives without isolate scope do not get the isolate scope from an isolate directive on the same element. If your code depends on this behavior (non-isolate directive needs to access state from within the isolate scope), change the isolate directive to use scope locals to pass these explicitly.

BREAKING CHANGE

ngAnimate addClass / removeClass animations are now applied right away. This means
that as soon as the animation starts the class will be added (addClass) or removed
(removeClass) to the element being animated instead of after the -add-active /
-remove-active animations are completed. This allows for animations outside of
ngAnimate to not conflict with $animate.

This commit introduces beforeAddClass and beforeRemoveClass animation event functions and
executes any addClass and removeClass event functions AFTER the class has been added or
removed (this is opposite functionality of how ngAnimate used to work when performing
JS-enabled animations addClass / removeClass animations). If your animation code relies on
any animations being performed prior to the class change then simply use the new
beforeAddClass and beforeRemoveClass animation event functions.

Finally, when animating show and hide animations using CSS transitions or keyframe animations,
ng-hide-remove doesn't require `display:block!important` for ng-hide-add anymore."

The example about transclusion and scopes worked only because the order of `scope` and `element`
arguments is wrong, which means that the `name' property of the scope is not really being updated.
To really work, the directive has to define its own scope, either a new child scope or, as is more
common with transclusion, an isolated scope.

BREAKING CHANGE:
This commit introduces the notion of ""private"" properties (properties
whose names begin and/or end with an underscore) on the scope chain.
These properties will not be available to Angular expressions (i.e. {{
}} interpolation in templates and strings passed to `$parse`)  They are
freely available to JavaScript code (as before).

Motivation
----------
Angular expressions execute in a limited context.  They do not have
direct access to the global scope, Window, Document or the Function
constructor.  However, they have direct access to names/properties on
the scope chain.  It has been a long standing best practice to keep
sensitive APIs outside of the scope chain (in a closure or your
controller.)  That's easier said that done for two reasons: (1)
JavaScript does not have a notion of private properties so if you need
someone on the scope chain for JavaScript use, you also expose it to
Angular expressions, and (2) the new ""controller as"" syntax that's now
in increased usage exposes the entire controller on the scope chain
greatly increaing the exposed surface.  Though Angular expressions are
written and controlled by the developer, they (1) typically deal with
user input and (2) don't get the kind of test coverage that JavaScript
code would.  This commit provides a way, via a naming convention, to
allow publishing/restricting properties from controllers/scopes to
Angular expressions enabling one to only expose those properties that
are actually needed by the expressions."

Recently we changed the priority of attribute interpolation directive to -100
to ensure that it executes early in the post linking phase. This causes issues
with when terminal directives are placed on elements with attribute bindings
because the terminal directive will usually have 0 or higher priority which
results in attr interpolation directive not being applied to the element.

To fix this issue I'm switching the priority back to 100 and making moving the
binding setup into the pre-linking function.

This means that:

- terminal directives with priority lower than 100 will not affect the attribute
  binding
- if a directive wants to add or alter bindings it can do so in the pre-linking
  phase, as long as the priority of this directive is more than 100
- all post-linking functions will execute after the attribute binding has been
  set up
- all pre-linking functions with directive priority lower than 100 will execute
  after the attribute bindings have been setup

BREAKING CHANGE: the attribute interpolation (binding) executes as a directive
with priority 100 and the binding is set up in the pre-linking phase. It used
to be that the priority was -100 in rc.2 (100 before rc.2) and that the binding
was setup in the post-linking phase.

stylesheet when csp is active, so I refactored the code to fix both issues.

Issue an error and abort compilation when two directives that ask for transclusion are found

caused the compilation context to be lost.

The ngRepeat directive has been special-cased to bypass this warning because it knows how to
handle this scenario internally.

Array.prototype.sort is speced out to be as potentionally unstable sort,
which is how it's implemented in FF and IE. This has caused the order
of directives with the same priority to vary between browsers.

For consistency sake, we now consider directive name and registration,
order when determining the order of directives with the same priority.

Note: it is still possible to get into a situation when the directive
order is underministic - when source files are loaded asynchronously
in non-deterministic order and there are are directives registered
with the same name and priority, the order in which they will be applied
will depend on the file load order."

In order to make urlUtils more accessible in the absence of DI,
its methods were converted to standalone functions available globally.

The urlUtils.resolve method was renamed urlResolve,
and was refactored to only take 1 argument, url,
and not the 2nd ""parse"" boolean.
The method now always returns a parsed url.
All places in code which previously wanted a string instead of a parsed

This commit disables promise unwrapping and adds
$parseProvider.unwrapPromises() getter/setter api that allows developers
to turn the feature back on if needed. Promise unwrapping support will
be removed from Angular in the future and this setting only allows for
enabling it during transitional period.

If the unwrapping is enabled, Angular will log a warning about each
expression that unwraps a promise (to reduce the noise, each expression
is logged only onces). To disable this logging use
`$parseProvider.logPromiseWarnings(false)`.

Previously promises found anywhere in the expression during expression
evaluation would evaluate to undefined while unresolved and to the
fulfillment value if fulfilled.

This is a feature that didn't prove to be wildly useful or popular,
primarily because of the dichotomy between data access in templates
(accessed as raw values) and controller code (accessed as promises).

In most code we ended up resolving promises manually in controllers
or automatically via routing and unifying the model access in this way.

Other downsides of automatic promise unwrapping:

- when building components it's often desirable to receive the
  raw promises
- adds complexity and slows down expression evaluation
- makes expression code pre-generation unattractive due to the
  amount of code that needs to be generated
- makes IDE auto-completion and tool support hard
- adds too much magic

BREAKING CHANGE: $parse and templates in general will no longer
automatically unwrap promises. This feature has been deprecated and
if absolutely needed, it can be reenabled during transitional period
via `$parseProvider.unwrapPromises(true)` api.

Also, we have some internal hash objects, where the keys for the map are provided
from outside AngularJS. In such cases we either prevent `hasOwnProperty` from
being used as a key or provide some other way of preventing our objects from
having their `hasOwnProperty` overridden.

BREAKING CHANGE: Inputs with name equal to ""hasOwnProperty"" are not allowed inside
form or ngForm directives.

Before, inputs whose name was ""hasOwnProperty"" were quietly ignored and not added
to the scope.  Now a badname exception is thrown.

Using ""hasOwnProperty"" for an input name would be very unusual and bad practice.
Either do not include such an input in a `form` or `ngForm` directive or change
the name of the input.

previously the compile/link fns executed in this order controlled via priority:

- CompilePriorityHigh, CompilePriorityMedium, CompilePriorityLow
- PreLinkPriorityHigh, PreLinkPriorityMedium, PreLinkPriorityLow
- link children
- PostLinkPriorityHigh, PostLinkPriorityMedium, PostLinkPriorityLow

This was changed to:

- CompilePriorityHigh, CompilePriorityMedium, CompilePriorityLow
- PreLinkPriorityHigh, PreLinkPriorityMedium, PreLinkPriorityLow
- link children
- PostLinkPriorityLow, PostLinkPriorityMedium , PostLinkPriorityHigh

Using this order the child transclusion directive that gets replaced
onto the current element get executed correctly (see issue #3558),
and more generally, the order of execution of post linking function
makes more sense. The incorrect order was an oversight that has
gone unnoticed for many suns and moons.

(FYI: postLink functions are the default linking functions)

BREAKING CHANGE: the order of postLink fn is now mirror opposite of
the order in which corresponding preLinking and compile functions
execute.

Very few directives in practice rely on order of postLinking function
(unlike on the order of compile functions), so in the rare case
of this change affecting an existing directive, it might be necessary
to convert it to a preLinking function or give it negative priority
(look at the diff of this commit to see how an internal attribute
interpolation directive was adjusted).

How did compiling a templateUrl (async) directive with `replace:true` work before this commit?
1/ apply all directives with higher priority than the templateUrl directive
2/ partially apply the templateUrl directive (create `beforeTemplateNodeLinkFn`)
3/ fetch the template
4/ apply second part of the templateUrl directive on the fetched template
(`afterTemplateNodeLinkFn`)

That is, the templateUrl directive is basically split into two parts (two `nodeLinkFn` functions),
which has to be both applied.

Normally we compose linking functions (`nodeLinkFn`) using continuation - calling the linking
function of a parent element, passing the linking function of the child elements as an argument. The
parent linking function then does:
1/ execute its pre-link functions
2/ call the child elements linking function (traverse)
3/ execute its post-link functions

Now, we have two linking functions for the same DOM element level (because the templateUrl directive
has been split).

There has been multiple issues because of the order of these two linking functions (creating
controller before setting up scope locals, running linking functions before instantiating
controller, etc.). It is easy to fix one use case, but it breaks some other use case. It is hard to
decide what is the ""correct"" order of these two linking functions as they are essentially on the
same level.

Running them side-by-side screws up pre/post linking functions for the high priority directives
(those executed before the templateUrl directive). It runs post-linking functions before traversing:
```js
beforeTemplateNodeLinkFn(null); // do not travers
afterTemplateNodeLinkFn(afterTemplateChildLinkFn);
```

Composing them (in any order) screws up the order of post-linking functions. We could fix this by
having post-linking functions to execute in reverse order (from the lowest priority to the highest)
which might actually make a sense.

**My solution is to remove this splitting.** This commit removes the `beforeTemplateNodeLinkFn`. The
first run (before we have the template) only schedules fetching the template. The rest (creating
scope locals, instantiating a controller, linking functions, etc) is done when processing the
directive again (in the context of the already fetched template; this is the cloned
`derivedSyncDirective`).

We still need to pass-through the linking functions of the higher priority directives (those
executed before the templateUrl directive), that's why I added `preLinkFns` and `postLinkFns`
arguments to `applyDirectivesToNode`.

This also changes the ""$compile transclude should make the result of a transclusion available to the
parent directive in post- linking phase (templateUrl)"" unit test. It was testing that a parent
directive can see the content of transclusion in its pre-link function. That is IMHO wrong (as the
`ngTransclude` directive inserts the translusion in its linking function). This test was only passing because of
c173ca412878d537b18df01f39e400ea48a4b398, which changed the behavior of the compiler to traverse
before executing the parent linking function. That was wrong and also caused the #3792 issue, which
this change fixes.

The problem was in keeping the values of `attrNameStart` and `attrNameEnd` between directive loop iterations which lead to the compiler looking for multi-element ranges for any directives that happened to be in the directive list after one that was applied on a range. For instance, having a ng-repeat-start and ng-class on a single element with ng-repeat being resolved first made the compiler look for an ng-repeat-end for both ng-repeat and ng-class because the `attrNameEnd` was not reset to a falsy value before the second iteration. As the result, an exception saying the block end element could not be found and the second directive was not actually applied.

Ref: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/4045

I have this sinking feeling that support this use case sort of
encourages binding to function that blindly trust some html.  For now,
I'm fixing the issue while I think about the use cases some more.

In the case of a function that performs any non-trivial work before
wrapping the value (e.g. the showdown filter in issue #3980, or the
binding to a simply wrapper function in issue #3932 if it did anything
meaty), this fix makes it ""work"" - but performance is going to suck -
you should bind to some other thing on scope that watches the actual
source and adjusts itself when that changes (e.g. the showdown filter.)
For the case of the wrapper in #3932, if one isn't performing
sanitization or some such thing - then you the developer has insight
into why that value is safe in that particular context - and it should
be available simply by name and not as a result of a function taking any
arbitrary input to make auditing of security a little saner.

Closes #3932, #3980"

It's great that IE11 wants to be compatible enough that it doesn't want
to be special cased and treated differently.

However, as long as one has to have a different code path for IE than
for the other supported browsers, we still need to detect and special
case it.  For instance, our URL parsing code still needs the same
workaround the we used for IE10.  We still see the same Access denied /
TypeError exceptions when setting certain values.  FYI, Angular doesn't
generally blindly test for IE – we also check the version number.

Thanks to modern.ie for the free IE11 test VM.

This change causes a new $digest to be scheduled in the next tick if
a task was was sent to the $evalAsync queue from outside of a $digest
or an $apply.

While this mode of operation is not common for most of the user code,
this change means that $q promises that utilze $evalAsync queue to
guarantee asynchronicity of promise apis will now also resolve outside
of a $digest, which turned out to be a big pain point for some developers.

The implementation ensures that we don't do more work than needed and
that we coalese as much work as possible into a single $digest.

The use of $browser instead of setTimeout ensures that we can mock out
and control the scheduling of ""auto-flush"", which should in theory
allow all of the existing code and tests to work without negative
side-effects.

When $timeout#flush is called with a delay and no task can be flushed within that
delay, the current time should not be updated as that gets the mock into an inconsistent
state.

BREAKING CHANGE: if a tests was written around the buggy behavior the delays might be off now

This would typically not be a problem, but because of the previous breaking change in
$timeout.flush, the combination of two might be confusing and that's why we are documenting
it.

Old behavior:

```
doSomething(); //schedules task to execute in 500ms from now
doOtherStuff(); //schedules task to execute in 600ms from now

try {
  $timeout.flush(300); // throws ""no task to be flushed"" exception
} catch(e) {};
$time.flush(200); //flushes only doSomething() task
```

New behavior:

```
doSomething(); //schedules task to execute in 500ms from now
doOtherStuff(); //schedules task to execute in 600ms from now

try {
  $timeout.flush(300); // throws ""no task to be flushed"" exception
} catch(e) {};
$time.flush(200); // throws ""no task to be flushed"" exception again
                  // because previous exception didn't move the time forward
```

Fixed test:

```
doSomething(); //schedules task to execute in 500ms from now
doOtherStuff(); //schedules task to execute in 600ms from now

try {
  $timeout.flush(300); // throws ""no task to be flushed"" exception
} catch(e) {};
$time.flush(500); // flushes only doSomething() task
```"

When calling $timeout.flush with or without a delay an exception should
be thrown if there is nothing to be flushed.

This prevents tests from flushing stuff unnecessarily.

BREAKING CHANGE: calling $timeout.flush(delay) when there is no task to be flushed
within the delay throws an exception now.

Please adjust the delay or remove the flush call from your tests as the exception
is a signed of a programming error."

BREAKING CHANGE: the `always` method has been renamed to `finally`.

The reason for this change is to align `$q` with the Q promises library,
despite the fact that this makes it a bit more difficult to
use with non-ES5 browsers, like IE8.

`finally` also goes well together with `catch` api that was added to
$q recently and is part of the DOM promises standard.

To migrate the code follow the example below:

Before:

$http.get('/foo').always(doSomething);

After:

$http.get('/foo').finally(doSomething);

or for IE8 compatible code:

$http.get('/foo')['finally'](doSomething);"

When using $resource you must setup your actions carefully based on what the server returns.
If the server responds to a request with an array then you must configure the action with
`isArray:true` and vice versa.  The built-in `get` action defaults to `isArray:false` and the
`query` action defaults to `isArray:true`, which is must be changed if the server does not do this.
Before the error message was an exception inside angular.copy, which didn't explain what the
real problem was. Rather than changing the way that angular.copy works, this change ensures that
a better error message is provided to the programmer if they do not set up their resource actions
correctly.

$sce is a service that provides Strict Contextual Escaping services to AngularJS.

Strict Contextual Escaping
--------------------------

Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is a mode in which AngularJS requires
bindings in certain contexts to result in a value that is marked as safe
to use for that context One example of such a context is binding
arbitrary html controlled by the user via ng-bind-html-unsafe.  We
refer to these contexts as privileged or SCE contexts.

As of version 1.2, Angular ships with SCE enabled by default.

Note:  When enabled (the default), IE8 in quirks mode is not supported.
In this mode, IE8 allows one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use
of the expression() syntax.  Refer
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx
to learn more about them.  You can ensure your document is in standards
mode and not quirks mode by adding <!doctype html> to the top of your
HTML document.

SCE assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b)
makes auditing for security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking,
etc. a lot easier.

Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:

  <input ng-model=""userHtml"">
  <div ng-bind-html-unsafe=""{{userHtml}}"">

Notice that ng-bind-html-unsafe is bound to {{userHtml}} controlled by
the user.  With SCE disabled, this application allows the user to render
arbitrary HTML into the DIV.  In a more realistic example, one may be
rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via bindings.  (HTML is
just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input
creates security vulnerabilities.)

For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,
to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.

How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that
was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you
ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some
properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?

To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can
determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that
context.  You can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done
for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server,
sanitized by your library, etc.  You can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps
allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.  Ensuring that the internal API
exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task.

In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses $sce.trustAs (and
shorthand methods such as $sce.trustAsHtml, etc.) to obtain values that
will be accepted by SCE / privileged contexts.

In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of
$sce.getTrusted(context, value) rather than to the value directly.
Directives use $sce.parseAs rather than $parse to watch attribute
bindings, which performs the $sce.getTrusted behind the scenes on
non-constant literals.

As an example, ngBindHtmlUnsafe uses $sce.parseAsHtml(binding
expression).  Here's the actual code (slightly simplified):

  var ngBindHtmlUnsafeDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {
    return function(scope, element, attr) {
      scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtmlUnsafe), function(value) {
        element.html(value || '');
      });
    };
  }];

Impact on loading templates
---------------------------

This applies both to the ng-include directive as well as templateUrl's
specified by directives.

By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and
protocol as the application document.  This is done by calling
$sce.getTrustedResourceUrl on the template URL.  To load templates from
other domains and/or protocols, you may either either whitelist them or
wrap it into a trusted value.

*Please note*:
The browser's Same Origin Policy and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS) policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether
the template is successfully loaded.  This means that without the right
CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain won't work on all
browsers.  Also, loading templates from file:// URL does not work on
some browsers.

This feels like too much overhead for the developer?
----------------------------------------------------

It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.

If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted
and you don't need to call $sce.trustAs on them.
e.g.  <div ng-html-bind-unsafe=""'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'""></div> just works.

Additionally, a[href] and img[src] automatically sanitize their URLs and
do not pass them through $sce.getTrusted.  SCE doesn't play a role here.

The included $sceDelegate comes with sane defaults to allow you to load
templates in ng-include from your application's domain without having to
even know about SCE.  It blocks loading templates from other domains or
loading templates over http from an https served document.  You can
change these by setting your own custom whitelists and blacklists for
matching such URLs.

This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the
small overhead and have an application that's secure and can be audited
to verify that with much more ease than bolting security onto an
application later."

In commit 6820322db562382fac903be35831275948825317 of Karma-Jasmine, the
dependency on angular.dump was removed. This caused two undesirable side
effects in the angular.js project. 1) Tests for presence of mock dump were failing,
and 2) the default window.dump was not outputting valuable angular-aware info. This
simple fix adds window.dump in testabilityPatch, to preprocess dumped input prior
to passing it to the global dump method."

parseKeyValue and toKeyValue can now handle duplicate values in the query.
```
?x=1&x=2 <-> {x:[1,2]}
```

The algorithm looks like:
    1)parseKeyValue looks for presence of obj[key]
    2)detects and replaces obj[key] with [obj[key],val]
    3)then pushes more duplicates if necessary
    4)toKeyValue decodes array correctly
    5)(not changed)$location.search({param: 'key'}) still replaces if necessary
    6)(not changed)$location.search({param: ['key1', 'key2']}) sets the url with duplicates

BREAKING CHANGE: Before this change:
- `parseKeyValue` only took the last key overwriting all the previous keys;
- `toKeyValue` joined the keys together in a comma delimited string.
This was deemed buggy behavior. If your server relied on this behavior
then either the server should be fixed or a simple serialization of
the array should be done on the client before passing it to $location."

With the recent refactoring of $location service we changed this behavior
resulting in a regression.

Previously we thought that html5 mode always required base[href]
to be set in order for urls to resolve properly. It turns out that
base[href] is problematic because it makes anchor urls (#foo) to
always resolve to the base url, which is almost always incorrect
and results in all anchors links and other anchor urls (e.g. svg
references) to be broken.

For this reason, we should now start recommending that people just
deploy to root context (/) and not set the base[href] when using
the html5 mode (push/pop history state).

If it's impossible to deploy to the root context then either all
urls in the app must be absolute or base[href] must be set with the
caveat that anchor urls in such app won't work.

BREAKING CHANGE: Concatenating expressions makes it hard to reason about
    whether some combination of concatenated values are unsafe to use
    and could easily lead to XSS.  By requiring that a single expression
    be used for *[src/ng-src] such as iframe[src], object[src], etc.
    (but not img[src/ng-src] since that value is sanitized), we ensure that the value
    that's used is assigned or constructed by some JS code somewhere
    that is more testable or make it obvious that you bound the value to
    some user controlled value.  This helps reduce the load when
    auditing for XSS issues.

    To migrate your code, follow the example below:

        Before:
            JS:
                scope.baseUrl = 'page';
                scope.a = 1;
                scope.b = 2;
            HTML:
                <!-- Are a and b properly escaped here? Is baseUrl
                     controlled by user? -->
                <iframe src=""{{baseUrl}}?a={{a}&b={{b}}"">

        After:
            JS:
                var baseUrl = ""page"";
                scope.getIframeSrc = function() {
                  // There are obviously better ways to do this.  The
                  // key point is that one will think about this and do
                  // it the right way.
                  var qs = [""a"", ""b""].map(function(value, name) {
                      return encodeURIComponent(name) + ""="" +
                             encodeURIComponent(value);
                    }).join(""&"");
                  // baseUrl isn't on scope so it isn't bound to a user
                  // controlled value.
                  return baseUrl + ""?"" + qs;
                }

BREAKING CHANGE: Interpolations inside DOM event handlers are
    disallowed.  DOM event handlers execute arbitrary Javascript code.
    Using an interpolation for such handlers means that the interpolated
    value is a JS string that is evaluated.  Storing or generating such
    strings is error prone and likely leads to an XSS if you're not
    super careful.  On the other hand, ng-click and such event handlers
    evaluate Angular expressions that are a lot safer (e.g. No direct
    access to global objects - only scope), cleaner and harder to
    exploit.

    To migrate the code follow the example below:

    Before:

        JS:   scope.foo = 'alert(1)';
        HTML: <div onclick=""{{foo}}"">

    After:

        JS:   scope.foo = function() { alert(1); }

$route, $routeParams and ngView have been pulled from core angular.js
to angular-route.js/ngRoute module.

This is was done to in order keep the core focused on most commonly
used functionality and allow community routers to be freely used
instead of $route service.

There is no need to panic, angular-route will keep on being supported
by the angular team.

Note: I'm intentionally not fixing tutorial links. Tutorial will need
bigger changes and those should be done when we update tutorial to
1.2.

BREAKING CHANGE: applications that use $route will now need to load
angular-route.js file and define dependency on ngRoute module.

Before:

```
...
<script src=""angular.js""></script>
...
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['someOtherModule']);
...
```

After:

```
...
<script src=""angular.js""></script>
<script src=""angular-route.js""></script>
...
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute', 'someOtherModule']);
...

Previously only repeated `/` delimiters were collapsed into a
single `/`.  Now, the sequence `/.` at the end of the template, i.e.
only followed by a sequence of word characters, is collapsed into a single
`.`. This makes it easier to support suffixes on resource URLs.
For example, given a resource template of `/some/path/:id.:format`, if
the `:id` is `""""` but format `""json""` then the URL is now
`/some/path.json`, rather than `/some/path/.json`.

BREAKING CHANGE: A `/` followed by a `.`, in the last segment of the
URL template is now collapsed into a single `.` delimiter. For example:
`users/.json` will become `users.json`. If your server relied upon this
sequence then it will no longer work. In this case you can now escape the
`/.` sequence with `/\.`"

Extend ng-options with a new clause, ""track by [trackByExpression]"", which can be used when
working with objects.  The `trackByExpression` should uniquely identify select options objects.
This solves the problem of previously having to match ng-options objects by identity.
You can now write: `ng-options=""obj as obj.name for obj in objects track by obj.id""`
The ""track by"" expression will be used when checking for equality of objects.

Examples:
<select
    ng-model=""user.favMovieStub""
    ng-options=""movie as movie.name for movie in movies track by movie.id"">
</select>

scope: {
  user: { name: 'Test user', favMovieStub: { id: 1, name: 'Starwars' } }
  movies: [{ id: 1, name: 'Starwars', rating: 5, ... }, { id: 13, ... }]
}

The select input will match user favMovieStub to the first movie in the movies array, and show
""Star Wars"" as the selected item."

In the example with draggable, the mouseDown handler needs to start with an event.preventDefault(). Otherwise the following bug occurs:
1) Select the text of the draggable span by clicking outside the span and dragging the mouse to the left or right through the span. Release the mouse button.
2) Now click on the span's inner text, and start to Drag it. The browser's default functionality that drags highlighted text so that it can be pasted into something else (say a document in a text editor) is invoked.
3) Release the mouse button. Now suddenly, you'll be dragging the span. But you won't be able to place it down on the page. It'll just follow the mouse around until the page is refreshed.

When ngMobile was merged in, we accidentaly included angular-scenario.js

`it` and `describe` global functions which essentially disabled all of
~200 unit tests for wrapped modules.

This change refactors the code to run the wrapped module tests.

I had to extract browserTrigger from scenario runner in order to achieve
this without code duplication."

If you wire up ngClass directly to an object on the scope, e.g. ng-class=""myClasses"",

there was a bug that changing scope.myClasses.classA = false, was not being picked

animations cause the dom to contain elements that have been removed

we could teach the e2e runner to wait for animations but that would
make all tests slower. it should be quite safe to just disable
animations automatically when the app is running via the e2e test
runner.

this change disables only css animations. we should make additional
change that disables js animations as well, but since we don't need
this right now I'm punting on it."

the `nextRoute` object available in `$routeChangeStart` handler
accidentaly leaked  property which pointed to the route definition
currently being matched.

this was done just for the internal needs of the `$route` implementation
and was never documented as public api.

Some confusion arouse around why the $route property was not always
available on the `nextRoute` object (see #1907). The right thing for us
to do is to prefix the property with $$ for now and refactor the code
to remove the property completely in the future. Application developers
should use the `nextRoute` object itself rather than its `$route` property.
The main diff is that nextRoute inherits from the object referenced by $route.

BREAKING CHANGE: in $routeChangeStart event, nextRoute.$route property is gone.

Use the nextRoute object instead of nextRoute.$route.

Migrates the Angular project from Rake to Grunt.

Benefits:
- Drops Ruby dependency
- Lowers barrier to entry for contributions from JavaScript ninjas
- Simplifies the Angular project setup and build process
- Adopts industry-standard tools specific to JavaScript projects
- Support building angular.js on Windows platform (really?!? why?!?)

BREAKING CHANGE: Rake is completely replaced by Grunt. Below are the deprecated Rake tasks and their Grunt equivalents:

rake --> grunt
rake package --> grunt package
rake init --> N/A
rake clean --> grunt clean
rake concat_scenario --> grunt build:scenario
rake concat --> grunt build
rake concat_scenario --> grunt build:scenario
rake minify --> grunt minify
rake version --> grunt write:version
rake docs --> grunt docs
rake webserver --> grunt webserver
rake test --> grunt test
rake test:unit --> grunt test:unit
rake test:<jqlite|jquery|modules|e2e> --> grunt test:<jqlite|jquery|modules|end2end|e2e>
rake test[Firefox+Safari] --> grunt test --browsers Firefox,Safari
rake test[Safari] --> grunt test --browsers Safari
rake autotest --> grunt autotest

NOTES:
* For convenience grunt test:e2e starts a webserver for you, while grunt test:end2end doesn't.
  Use grunt test:end2end if you already have the webserver running.
* Removes duplicate entry for Describe.js in the angularScenario section of angularFiles.js
* Updates docs/src/gen-docs.js to use #done intead of the deprecated #end
* Uses grunt-contrib-connect instead of lib/nodeserver (removed)
* Removes nodeserver.sh, travis now uses grunt webserver
* Built and minified files are identical to Rake's output, with the exception of one less
  character for git revisions (using --short) and a couple minor whitespace differences

Sometimes is not desirable to use interpolation on attributes because
the user agent parses them before the interpolation takes place. I.e:

<svg>
  <circle cx=""{{cx}}"" cy=""{{cy}}"" r=""{{r}}""></circle>
</svg>

The snippet throws three browser errors, one for each attribute.

For some attributes, AngularJS fixes that behaviour introducing special
directives like ng-href or ng-src.

This commit is a more general solution that allows prefixing any
attribute with ""ng-attr-"", ""ng:attr:"" or ""ng_attr_""  so it will
be set only when the binding is done. The prefix is then removed.

Example usage:

<svg>
  <circle ng-attr-cx=""{{cx}}"" ng-attr-cy=""{{cy}}"" ng:attr-r=""{{r}}""></circle>
</svg>

A workaround for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=608735
In FF getAllResponseHeaders() returns null if the request is the result of CORS.

Tried to format the code so that when a FF patch is released and gains enough
traction it can easily be selected and deleted. Heavily inspired by jQuery's
patch for the same bug. This patch falls short of passing through custom headers
but covers all of the ""simple response headers"" in the spec at
http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/

This commit should get reverted once Firefox 21 gets out.

Apparently there is a really weird bug in IE6-8 that causes anchor textContent

Inserting a bogus comment node into all anchor elements in IE works around this
browser bug.

I'm fixing the issue via directive because that way we'll fix it for jQuery as
well.

I fixed an e2e test too because it was incorrect.

this test to make sure that we don't over-encode the params and break stuff

$http to encode any non-url parameters resulting in a query string like ""/Path/doh?bar=baz1&bar=baz2"".

backend should be fixed or a simple serialization of the array should be done

This commit fixes #1261 and #1532. This covers
two separate issues:

- Positive timezones were being formatted without

of ""12:13:14+1000"". Fixed by checking if timezone
is > 0 and adding a leading ""+"".

- Timezone output signs were inverted.
mock.TzDate expects the timezone _offset_ as it's
first argument, _not_ the timezone. This means
that a mock.TzDate with a positive offset should
result in a date string with a negative timezone,
and vice-versa.

The jQuery implementation of children only returns child nodes of the given element that are elements themselves. The previous jqLite implementation was returning all nodes except those that are text nodes. Use jQLite.contents() to get all the child nodes.

The jQuery implementation of contents returns [] if the object has no child nodes.  The previous jqLite implementation was returning undefined, causing a stack overflow in test/testabilityPatch.js when it tried to `cleanup()` a window object.

The testabilityPatch was incorrectly using children() rather than contents() inside cleanup() to iterate down through all the child nodes of the element to clean up."

In cases when we reuse elements in a repeater but associate
them with a new scope (see #933 - repeating over array of
primitives) it's possible for the internal ngModel state and
the scope state to get out of sync. This change ensure that
the two are always sync-ed up even in cases where we
reassociate an element with a different (but similar) scope.

In the case of repeating over array of primitives it's still
possible to run into issue if we iterate over primitives and
use form controls or similar widgets without ngModel - oh well,
we'd likely need a special repeater for primitives to deal
with this properly, even then there might be cornercases.

4.440892098500626e-16 instead of 0.

This change tweaks the number formatting logic so that an exponential
value with a negative exponent that is larger than the precision+1
returns 0 instead. For example: with precision 2, anything with an
exponent of -4, -5 or more would become 0. 9e-3 = 0.009 = 0.01, but 9e-4
= 0.0009 = 0.001 = 0.00. This detail is unlikely to matter since this

Makes the time zone optional in the date filter

Problem with the current R_ISO8601_STR regex was that the time was optional, but the zone was not.
This results in the filter not formatting local date times, which it could easily do.

For example:
2012-08-30 -> formatted
2012-08-30T06:06:06.123Z -> formatted
2012-08-30T06:06:06.123 -> NOT formatted

A simple change in the regex fixes this. Arguably this is closer to the ISO8601 spec which specifies
local dates being in the ""current time zone"" and not requiring a Z. In any case it behaves more like
a user would expect."

Short summary: if you use local node server everything should work as before,
if you use GAE, everything should work now as well, but we pull assets from CDN.

- GAE doesn't support ':' in filenames, so I had to replace it with '_'
  but only in the filename, all servers were reconfigured to rewrite the
  urls from : to _ when doing file lookup
- We now pull angular assets from google CDN when deployed on GAE (locally
  or in production). When running on a non GAE server we pull assets from
  ../ directory as before
- Since only certain versions of Angular are available on CDN and we want

Since developers are allowed to customize start/end interpolation
strings, but third-party directive creators don't know about these
customizations, we should standardize on {{ }} in templates of
reusable (third-party) directives. During the compilation, these
templates are then denormalized to use whatever the custom
start/end symbol is, effectively translating the template into the
syntax of the runtime environment.

This addresses an issue raised at http://goo.gl/e8VPV

Existing code should not be affected by this change since project
that do use custom interpolation markers are not expected to use
{{ }} in existing directive templates."

this fix ensures that we prevent the default action on form submission
(full page reload) even in cases when the form is being destroyed as
a result of the submit event handler (e.g. when route change is
triggered).

The fix is more complicated than I'd like it to be mainly because
we need to ensure that we don't create circular references between
js closures and dom elements via DOM event handlers that would then
result in a memory leak.

Also the differences between IE8, IE9 and normal browsers make testing
this ugly.

the original test relied on incorrect assumptions about how jasmine async
tests work (when setTimeout is triggered) and how browser reloads a page
(the sequence of events) and thus the test passes even when the default
is not prevented.

this change fixes the test by registering an extra submit event handler
that checks if the default was prevented.

if the default was not prevented, the test will fail and the page will
be reloaded causing the test runner to panic."

When user clicks a link, $location needs to intercept this event.  The <a> doesn't have to be target element of the DOM event, so it needs to traverse the DOM, to find first <a> parent.

If the target element was removed from DOM, during the same event, it would throw an exception. This fixes the issue.

Changed the isolate scope binding options to:
  - @attr - attribute binding (including interpolation)
  - =model - by-directional model binding
  - &expr - expression execution binding

This change simplifies the terminology as well as
number of choices available to the developer. It
also supports local name aliasing from the parent.

BREAKING CHANGE: isolate scope bindings definition has changed and
the inject option for the directive controller injection was removed.

To migrate the code follow the example below:

Before:

scope: {
  myAttr: 'attribute',
  myBind: 'bind',
  myExpression: 'expression',
  myEval: 'evaluate',
  myAccessor: 'accessor'
}

After:

scope: {
  myAttr: '@',
  myBind: '@',
  myExpression: '&',
  // myEval - usually not useful, but in cases where the expression is assignable, you can use '='
  myAccessor: '=' // in directive's template change myAccessor() to myAccessor
}

The removed `inject` wasn't generaly useful for directives so there should be no code using it."

CSP (content security policy) forbids apps to use eval or
Function(string) generated functions (among other things). For us to be
compatible, we just need to implement the ""getterFn"" in $parse without
violating any of these restrictions.

We currently use Function(string) generated functions as a speed
optimization. With this change, it will be possible to opt into the CSP
compatible mode using the ngCsp directive. When this mode is on Angular
will evaluate all expressions up to 30% slower than in non-CSP mode, but
no security violations will be raised.

In order to use this feature put ngCsp directive on the root element of
the application. For example:

<!doctype html>
<html ng-app ng-csp>
  ...
  ...
</html>

with this change, we rewrite the url unless:

rewriting.

Often it is impossible to set the http defaults during the config phase,
because the config info is not available at this time.

A good example is authentication - often the app needs to bootstrap,
allow user to enter credentials and only then it gains access to
session token which then should be sent to the server with every request.
Without having the ability to set the defaults at runtime, the developer
either has to resort to hacks, or has to set the session token header
with every request made by the app."

It turns out that listening only on ""blur"" event is not sufficient in many scenarios,
especially when you use form validation you always had to use ngModelnstant

The feedback we got from our apps as well as external apps is that the
ngModelInstant should be the default.

In the future we might provide alternative ways of suppressing updates
on each key stroke, but it's not going to be the default behavior.

Apps already using the ngModelInstant can safely remove it from their
templates. Input fields without ngModelInstant directive will start propagating
the input changes into the model on each key stroke."

Problems:

- controller was instantiated immediately on $afterRouteChange (even if no content), that's
different compare to ng:controller, which instantiates controllers after compiling
- route listened on current scope ($afterRouteChange), so if you were listening on $rootScope
($afterRouteChange), you get called first and current.scope === undefined, which is flaky
- route handles scope destroying, but scope is created by ng:view
- route fires after/before route change even if there is no route (when no otherwise specified)

Solution:

- route has no idea about scope, whole scope business moved to ng:view (creating/destroying)
- scope is created (and controller instantiated) AFTER compiling the content
- that means on $afterRouteChange - there is no scope yet (current.scope === undefined)
- added $contentLoaded event fired by ng:view, after linking the content"

currently we run into infinite digest if a function is being

of a better way to deal with this right now"

$http:
- use promises internally
- get rid of XhrFuture that was previously used internally
- get rid of $browser.defer calls for async stuff (serving from cache),
  promises will take care of asynchronicity
- fix transformation bugs (when caching requested + multiple request
  pending + error is returned)
- get rid of native header parsing and instead just lazily parse the
  header string

$httpBackend:
- don't return raw/mock XMLHttpRequest object (we don't use it for
  anything anymore)
- call the callback with response headers string

mock $httpBackend:
- unify response api for expect and when
- call the callback with response headers string
- changed the expect/when failure error message so that EXPECTED and GOT
  values are aligned

- since NaN !== NaN in javascript digest can get into an infinite loop
  when model value is set to NaN
- angular.equals(NaN, NaN) should return true since that's what we
  expect when comparing primitives or objects containing NaN values

Previously NaN because of its special === properties was used as the
initial value for watches, but that results in issues when NaN is used
as model value.

In order to allow for model to be anything incuding undefined and NaN we
need to mark the initial value differently in a way that would avoid
these issues, allow us to run digest without major perf penalties and
allow for clients to determine if the listener is being called because
the watcher is being initialized or because the model changed. This
implementation covers all of these scenarios.

BREAKING CHANGE: previously to detect if the listener was called because
the watcher was being initialized, it was suggested that clients check
if old value is NaN. With this change, the check should be if the newVal
equals the oldVal.

Along the way I also changed the repeater impl to use for loop instead
of for in loop.

Iteration over objects is handled by creating an array of keys, which is
sorted and this array then determines the order of iteration over an
element. This makes repeating over objects deterministic and
cross-browser compatible."

Change introduced by me in 8611ebe6 results in considerable inefficiencies when the compiler
and linker is used from within a widget, in which case, we call $digest unnecessary since it
will be called by the $apply which called the directive/widget in the first place.

There are only two places when the extra $digest call can be useful - when manually bootstrapping
the app or in tests. However even in tests this behavior can result in unwanted results (especially
when ng:controller is involved). So it is better to leave it for the developer to call $digest
when it is really needed."

It is better to be explicit about our intention and wrap the assignement
into parens:

This reverts commit 2428907259fa80ec3b1b4bfd85ea20028a9f4fa5.

We decided to revert this because it is not bullet proof. The issue is
that we can't reliably have both angular and non-angular code in charge
of the DOM. We could work around some issues here and there, but we
can't do it reliably, so it's better not to support DOM manipulation
that happens outside of angular. There is a good chance that once we
integrate with MDVs our possition will change, but until then our
position is that only angular or angular widgets/directives can change
change DOM that was compiled."

sync caching in ng:view must be reverted becase ng:view uses
$route.onChange to listen for changes.

$route fires all onChange events before it calls $become(Controller)
which means that if the template being included via ng:view contains
ng:controller, ng:include or other widget that create new scopes,
these scopes will be created and initialized before the parent scope
is fully initialized (happens after $become is called).

For this reason ng:view must be async.

The new scope implemenetation will resolve this issue by providing
us with an api to register one-off tasks to be executed during the
flush phase. We'll be able to compile and link the included template
safely at this time."

to override a service that has dependencies with a services with

- By default the runner now creates multiple output formats as it runs. Nodes are created in the DOM with ids: json, xml, and html.

ex. $('#json').html() => json output of the runner
ex. $('#xml').html() => json output of the runner

$result is also an object tree result.

The permitted formats are html,json,xml,object.

If you don't want certain formats you can select specific ones with the new ng:scenario-output attribute on the script tag.

<script src=""angular-scenario.js"" ng:scenario-output=""xml,json"">

- Added element(...).count() that returns the number of matching elements for the selector.

- repeater(...).count() now returns 0 if no elements matched which can be used to check if a repeater is empty.

- Added toBe() matcher that does strict equality with ===

- Implement iit and ddescribe. If iit() is used instead of it() then only that test will run. If ddescribe() is used instead of describe() them only it() statements inside of it will run. Several iit/ddescribe() blocks can be used to run isolated tests.

- Implement new event based model for SpecRunner. You can now listen for events in the runner. This is useful for writing your own UI or connecting a remote process (ex. WebDriver). Event callbacks execute on the Runner instance.

Events, if fired, will always be in the below order. All events always happen
except for Failure and Error events which only happen in error conditions.

Events:
  RunnerBegin
  SpecBegin(spec)
  StepBegin(spec, step)
  StepError(spec, step, error)
  StepFailure(spec, step, error)
  StepEnd(spec, step)
  SpecError(spec, step, error)
  SpecEnd(spec)
  RunnerEnd

- Only allow the browser to repaint every 10 steps. Cuts 700ms off Firefox in benchmark, 200ms off Chrome.

- Bug Fix: Manually navigate anchors on click since trigger wont work in Firefox."

Sanitization works in two phases:
 1) We parse the HTML into sax-like events (start, end, chars).
    HTML parsing is very complex, and so it may very well be that what
    most browser consider valid HTML may not pares properly here,
    but we do best effort. We treat this parser as untrusted.
 2) We have safe sanitizeWriter which treats its input (start, end, chars)
    as untrusted content and escapes everything. It only allows elements
    in the whitelist and only allows attributes which are whitelisted.
    Any attribute value must not start with 'javascript:'. This check
    is performed after escaping for entity (&xAB; etc..) and ignoring

Polish the Scenario Runner UI to include:
- a scroll pane that steps appear in since the list can be very long
- Collapse successful tests
- Show the line where the DSL statements were when there's an error (Chrome, Firefox)

Also:
- Remove lots angular.bind calls to reduce the amount of stack space used.
- Use setTimeout(...,0) to schedule the next future to let the browser breathe and have it repaint the steps. Also prevents overflowing the stack when an it() creates many futures.
- Run afterEach() handlers even if the it() block fails.
- Make navigateTo() take a function as the second argument so you can compute a URL in the future.
- Add wait() DSL statement to allow interactive debugging of tests.
- Allow custom jQuery selectors with element(...).query(fn) DSL statement.

Known Issues:
- All afterEach() handlers run even if a beforeEach() handler fails. Only after handlers for the same level as the failure and above should run."

- ""this"" always means the current chain scope inside a DSL

- addFutureAction callbacks now take ($window, $document, done)

- $document has a special method elements() that uses the currently selected nodes in the document as defined by using() statements.

- $document.elements() allows placeholder insertion into selectors to make them more readable.
  ex. $document.elements('input[name=""$1""]', myVar) will substitute the value of myVar for $1 in the selector. Subsequent arguments are $2 and so on.

- $document.elements() results have a special method trigger(event) which should be used to events. This method implements some hacks to make sure browser UI controls update and the correct angular events fire.

- futures now allow custom formatting. By default any chain that results in a future can use toJson() or fromJson() to convert the future value to and from json. A custom parser can be provided with parsedWith(fn) where fn is a callback(value) that must return the parsed result.

Note: The entire widgets.html UI is now able to be controlled and asserted through DSL statements!!! Victory! :)"

  - added angular.injector(scope, services, instanceCache) which returns inject
    - inject method can return, instance, or call function which have $inject
      property
    - initialize services with $creation=[eager|eager-publish] this means that
      only some of the services are now globally accessible
  - upgraded $become on scope to use injector hence respect the $inject property
    for injection
    - $become should not be run multiple times and will most likely be removed
      in future version
  - added $new on scope to create a child scope
     - $inject is respected on constructor function
  - simplified scopes so that they no longer have separate __proto__ for
    parent, api, behavior and instance this should speed up execution since
    scope will now create one __proto__ chain per scope (not three).

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
  - services now need to have $inject instead of inject property for proper
    injection this breaks backward compatibility
  - not all services are now published into root scope
    (only: $location, $cookie, $window)
  - if you have widget/directive which uses services on scope
    (such as this.$xhr), you will now have to inject that service in
    (as it is not published on the root scope anymore)"
