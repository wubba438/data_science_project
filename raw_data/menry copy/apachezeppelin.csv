### What is this PR for?
I found DockerInterpreterLauncher can't run.

Because DockerInterpreterLauncher needs to support Standard Interpreter and spark interpreter,
Rely on StandardInterpreterLauncher and SparkInterpreterLauncher.

However, the StandardInterpreterLauncher and SparkInterpreterLauncher are moved to the zeppelin-zengine module in [ZEPPELIN-4227](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4227), and the DockerInterpreterLauncher is dynamically loaded by the classloader, so the DockerInterpreterLauncher cannot call functions in the StandardInterpreterLauncher and SparkInterpreterLauncher in different classloads.

### What is this PR for?
Livy can run behind a reverse proxy that requires SSL authentication.
To support this, three additional properties have been added:

 - zeppelin.livy.ssl.keyStore
 - zeppelin.livy.ssl.keyStorePassword
 - zeppelin.livy.ssl.keyStoreType

The keystore type can either be JKS or PKCS12. The default is JKS. To
keep things streamlined, a property `zeppelin.livy.ssl.trustStoreType`
has been been added as well. Default value is also JKS.

Set up a livy instance behind a reverse proxy (e.g. HAProxy) that requires two way SSL authentication to access it. Configure the Livy interpreter to access this instance by setting the following properties:

- zeppelin.livy.ssl.keyStore: Path to keystore containing client certificate and key
- zeppelin.livy.ssl.keyStorePassword: Password of keystore
- zeppelin.livy.ssl.keyStoreType: Either JKS or PKCS12
- zeppelin.livy.ssl.trustStore: Path to trust store containing proxy host certificate

The pr is to fix a bug that will make the **ipython** `execute_interactive` hang forever if a auto `complete` call is make at the same time. (see unit test for example that is failing on master).

For now the fix is to synchronize those method : `execute` / `complete`. It will not bring regression because anyway, the kernel does not support concurrent execute and auto complete (see https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3763)

The hotfix that was made several weeks ago changed behavior of LocalStorageConfig.atomicWriteToFile, that started to atomically move files to destination. But this works without errors only when temporary directory and destination are on the same disk. When they are on different disks, atomic move isn't possible, so the exception is thrown.

This PR fixes this by performing non-atomic move to temp file on destination file system, and then atomically rename it to destination file.

All need to be notified to all the zeppelin servers in the cluster to synchronize the update of InterpreterSetting. Failure to do so will result in the user not being able to continue while switching to another server.

1. Listen for note update events
  Listen for the NEW_INTERPRETER_SETTING、DEL_INTERPRETER_SETTING、UPDATE_INTERPRETER_SETTING ... event of the InterpreterSetting in the InterpreterSettingManager#onMessage() function.

2. Broadcast note update event
  The note is refreshed by notifying the event to all zeppelin servers in the cluster via messagingService.

### What is this PR for?
1. Show/Hide cluster Manager web page menu
Zeppelin navbar checks for cluster mode via the `api/cluster/address` REST interface, and adds cluster to the zeppelin `login menu` if it is in cluster mode.

2. Cluster Manager  node web page
    The webpage obtains all the node information in the cluster metadata through the `/api/cluster/nodes`  REST interface.
    * All zeppelin server node informat
    * List of interpreter processes running in each node

3. Cluster Manager  interpreter web page
    Clicking on the interpreter list in the node management page will open the interpreter information page, displaying all the information of the interpreter.

### What is this PR for?
1. **ClusterInterpreterLauncher can not listen cluster events**
In Cluster mode, The `ClusterInterpreterLauncher` needs to listen for cluster events, Accept requests from other zeppelin servers to create interpreter processes.
Since the `ClusterInterpreterLauncher` is lazy, dynamically generated, So in cluster mode, when the zeppelin service starts, Create a `ClusterInterpreterLauncher` object, This allows the `ClusterInterpreterLauncher` to listen for cluster events.

2. **Replace `RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess` with `ClusterInterpreterProcess` for local interpreter process creation**
Because in cluster mode, `RemoteInterpreterServer` performs service discovery by registering thrift's `ip` and `port` into the cluster metadata, not through the thrift interface `callback`.

### What is this PR for?
Zeppelin service runs on local server. zeppelin is able to run the interpreter in the docker container, Isolating the operating environment of the interpreter through the docker container. Zeppelin can be easily used without having to install python, spark, etc. on the local node.

Design Doc : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ESQEHmGlw4kaXkK5Hn2AOJYBLWDZRU9shB3WHuGV-CM/edit

#### Key benefits are
1. Interpreter environment isolating
2. Not need to install `python lib`, `spark binary package`, etc. environment on the local node
3. Docker does not need to pre-install zeppelin binary package, Automatically upload local zeppelin interpreter lib files to the container
4. Automatically upload local configuration files (such as `spark-conf`, `hadoop-conf-dir`, `keytab file`, ...) to the container, so that the running environment in the container is exactly the same as the local.
5. Zeppelin server runs locally, making it easier to manage and maintain
6. Support zeppelin all interpreter
7. Support spark interpreter, `local[*]`, `cluster-client`, `cluster-yarn` mode.

### What is this PR for?
In distributed cluster deployment mode, look for servers with idle resources in the cluster and create an interpreter process. In single-server deployment mode, the interpreter process is created directly on the machine.

Just set the cluster server list in `zeppelin-site.xml`
```
<property>
  <name>zeppelin.cluster.addr</name>
  <value>10.120.196.234:6000,10.120.196.235:6000,10.120.196.236:6000</value>
</property>
```
The interpreter process can be created in the cluster server through any zeppelin server.

### What is this PR for?
Upon raising the concern (ZEPPELIN-3860), we were suggested to upgrade the zeppelin service from 0.7.3 to 0.8.0 version. With the current zeppelin version i.e 0.8.0 the frequency of broken pipe error has gone up.

When connecting to a database through a database connection pool, If there is no sql operation for a long time, The database connection pool will actively close this connection. The connection between the client and the database is broken.

So by increasing
```
poolableConnectionFactory.setValidationQuery(""show databases"");
```
Periodically call the `show databases` statement, Keep the connection to the database.

The cluster management server uses the Raft algorithm library Atomix to form a service cluster with consistent service status in the Zeppelin cluster. The cluster management client connects to the cluster management server for metadata operations of services and processes. The cluster monitoring module checks if each Zeppelin-Server and Zeppelin Interpreter process in the cluster is active.

### What is this PR for?
There're several places in zeppelin to launch processes, such as interpreter process launch, python process launch.  Sometimes it is very hard to diagnose if the process is failed to launch or some error happens during its lifecycle. This PR introduce ProcessLauncher to encapsulate process launch. ProcessLauncher will do most of the process launching stuff but also allow for customization. E.g. how to check the process is started properly. And when error happens, ProcessLauncher will capture the necessary error output for further diagnose.

### What is this PR for?
Fix CreateNote() function throw Note existed IOException caused travis to fail.
When using trivis-ci, The exception will be triggered randomly.

#### **Cause Analysis:**
1. Recently, Notebook added a new one in createNote() to determine if the note name already exists. If it exists, an exception is thrown.
2. In the test case, the code
TestUtils.getInstance(Notebook.class) creates a global single instance object.

3. Program processing flow
    + TestUtils.getInstance(Notebook.class).createNote(""note1"", anonymous);
    + After executing some test code, eg: spark, python, etc
    + TestUtils.getInstance(Notebook.class).removeNote(note.getId(), anonymous);
    + Delete this note.
    + If the spark, python exception is thrown before removeNote, then the note still exists. Causes other test cases to be abnormal.

### What is this PR for?
1. Set in zeppelin-env.sh `export ZEPPELIN_FORCE_STOP=true`
2. Create an interpreter process container in the remote YARN.
3. When restart this interpreter, The interpreter process container will have a ConcurrentModificationException and will not exit properly.

The reason for this BUG is: When `export ZEPPELIN_FORCE_STOP=true`,
Restart the interpreter process, the zeppelin server will execute the session that closes the process.
At the same time, the `shutdown()` and `close()` will be remote call.

In the RemoteInterpreterServer, the `shutdown()` and `close()` functions do not have concurrency control on the interpreterGroup, Causes an exception.

### What is this PR for?
The interpreter is executed according to the paragraph. Click the run button in the paragraph, and only the code content in the current paragraph can be obtained in the interpreter process.

To pass the Dashboard paragraph in the submarine interpreter, you need to submit all the code content in this note to tensorflow for execution.

So, I think need to get the note data in sever through `RemoteInterpreterEventServer` in the interpreter process.

I implemented two other methods, so that the interpreter can get the note in the server, the actual running effect is not the best solution.

**1) By having the interpreter directly access the external storage of the note repository, such as HDFS, S3.**

1. But this limits the need to store notes in an external storage system.
2. In hdfs with kerberos authentication system enabled, not all users can access the note folder.

**2) Get the note from the server from the REST client in the interpreter.**

1. Need to let zeppelin/api/notes intercept in shrio.ini.
2. Or let the interpreter access the REST interface of the server through the user and password, but it is not safe.

In addition, in [JIRA-4018](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4018) Workflow and orchestration, it is also necessary to query all the notes and paragraphs of the user in the workflow paragraph for the execution of the note.

zeppelin-interpreter-integration is ignored due to wrong folder structure, that means all the integration of this module is ignored. This PR fix this issue, rename `zeppelin-interpreter-integration/src/main/test` to  `zeppelin-interpreter-integration/src/test`. Besides that, I split `SparkIntegrationTest` & `ZeppelinSparkClusterTest` into each spark version and each travis build will only run integration test and unit test for each spark version.

### What is this PR for?
At present, Bind's angularObject in note is only valid in the current operation web page.
When the note is reopened, or the zeppelin service is restarted, the angularObject of Bind in the note cannot be displayed, and the bind operation must be repeated.

The submarine has a lot of startup commands and parameters. In order to provide the best experience for the user, we provide the parameters to the user through the WEB control.

Zeppelin's own dynamic form is more suitable for parameter input in the query, but it does not meet the needs of the submarine interpreter, so the submarine interpreter uses the angular template to generate a richer input interface.
The controls in the interface are saved to the note through Bind's angularObject, so that when the user reopens the note, there is no need to re-enter it.

[Improvement]

```

In the `hadoop submarine interpreter`, each paragraph of a notebook represents a complete module of a machine learning algorithm. The name of the algorithm name needs to be filled in through the title of the paragraph.

The notebook paragraph does not display the title by default.
You can display the title by default with `config.title = true`.

### What type of PR is it?
This PR adds ability to run Zeppelin on Kubernetes. It aims

 - Zero configuration to start Zeppelin on Kubernetes. (and Spark on Kubernetes)
 - Run everything on Kubernetes: Zeppelin, Interpreters, Spark.
 - Highly customizable to adopt various user configurations and extensions.

Key features are

 - Provides zeppelin-server.yaml file for `kubectl` to run Zeppelin server
 - All interpreters are automatically running as a Pod.
 - Spark interpreter automatically configured to use [Spark on Kubernetes](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-kubernetes.html)
 - Reverse proxy is configured to access Spark UI

To do
 - [x] Document how reverse proxy for Spark UI works and how to configure custom domain.
 - [x] Document how to customize zeppelin-server and interpreter yaml.
 - [x] Document new configurations
 - [x] Document how to mount volume for notebook and configurations

### How it works

#### Run Zeppelin Server on Kubernetes
`k8s/zeppelin-server.yaml` is provided to run Zeppelin Server with few sidecars and configurations.
This file is easy to publish (user can easily consume it using `curl`), highly customizable while it includes all the necessary things.

#### K8s Interpreter launcher
This PR adds new module, `launcher-k8s-standard` under `zeppelin/zeppelin-plugins/launcher/k8s-standard/` directory. This launcher is [automatically being selected](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3240/files#diff-82fddd2ffb77aaffc4b9cf7b5b1eaa79) when Zeppelin is running on Kubernetes. The launcher both handles Spark interpreter and All other interpreters.

The launcher launches interpreter as a Pod using template [k8s/interpreter/100-interpreter-pod.yaml](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3240/files#diff-d9ce62e2c992d32f0184d7edb862f3c4).
Reason filename has `100-` in prefix is because all files in the directory is consumed in alphabetical order by launcher on interpreter start/stop. User can drop more files here to extend/customize interpreter, and filename can be used to control order. The template is rendered by [jinjava](https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava).

#### Spark interpreter

When interpreter group is `spark`, K8sRemoteInterpreterProcess [sets necessary spark configuration](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3240/files#diff-6d1d3084f55bdd519e39ede4a619e73dR297) automatically to use [Spark on Kubernetes](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-kubernetes.html). User doesn't have to configure anything. It uses client mode.

#### Spark UI

We may make user manually configure port-forward or do something to access Spark UI, but that's not optimal. It is the best when Spark UI is automatically accessible when user have access to Zeppelin UI, without any extra configuration.

To enable this, Zeppelin server Pod has a reverse proxy as a sidecar, and it split traffic to Zeppelin server and Spark UI running in the other Pod. It assume both `service.domain.com` and `*.service.domain.com` point the nginx proxy address. `service.domain.com` is directed to ZeppelinServer, `*.service.domain.com` is directed to interpreter Pod.

`<port>-<interpreter pod svc name>.service.domain.com` is convention to access any application running in interpreter Pod. If Spark interpreter Pod is running with a name `spark-axefeg` and Spark UI is running on port 4040,

```
4040-spark-axefeg.service.domain.com
```

is the address to access Spark UI. Default service domain is [local.zeppelin-project.org:8080](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3240/files#diff-56ccb2e2c2617b27dbaae866d9431e51R22), while `local.zeppelin-project.org` and `*.local.zeppelin-project.org` point `127.0.0.1`, and it works with `kubectl port-forward`.

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3840

### How should this be tested?

Prepare a Kubernetes cluster with enough resources (cpus > 5, mem > 6g).
If you're using [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube), check your capacity using `kubectl describe node` command before start.

You'll need to build Zeppelin docker image and Spark docker image to test. Please follow guide docs/quickstart/kubernetes.md.

To quickly try without building docker images, I have uploaded pre-built image on docker hub `moon/zeppelin:0.9.0-SNAPSHOT`, `moon/spark:2.4.0`. Try following command

```
ZEPPELIN_SERVER_YAML=""curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin/kubernetes/k8s/zeppelin-server.yaml""
$ZEPPELIN_SERVER_YAML | sed 's/apache\/zeppelin:0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/moon\/zeppelin:0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/' | sed 's/spark:2.4.0/moon\/spark:2.4.0/' | kubectl apply -f -
```

And port forward

```
kubectl port-forward zeppelin-server 8080:80
```

And browse http://localhost:8080

To clean up

```
$ZEPPELIN_SERVER_YAML | sed 's/apache\/zeppelin:0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/moon\/zeppelin:0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/' | sed 's/spark:2.4.0/moon\/spark:2.4.0/' | kubectl delete -f -
```

### Screenshots (if appropriate)
See this video https://youtu.be/7E4ZGn4pnTo

### Future work

 - Per interpreter docker image
 - Blocking communication between interpreter Pod.
 - Spark Interpreter Pod has Role CRUD for any pod/service in the same namespace. Which should be restricted to only Spark executors Pod.
 - Per note interpreter mode by default when Zeppelin is running on Kubernetes

* Does the licenses files need update? no
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no
* Does this needs documentation? yes

The default value for these two settings is 1000 which can slow down a Zeppelin instance quite a lot if a SQL query returns a big chunk of data. See [1] and [2] for more info about these function calls.

[1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html#setFetchSize-int-
[2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html#setMaxRows-int-

### What type of PR is it?

### Todos

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3879

### How should this be tested?
* CI pass

### Screenshots (if appropriate)

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? No.
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No.
* Does this needs documentation? Yes. For the time being, I'd like the Zeppelin authors input whether such a change makes sense.

Thanks!

### What is this PR for?

By default, spark.executor.memory is not set in spark's interpreter setting, if I set it in spark-defaults.xml, then it won't take effect. Because spark.executor.memory in spark's interpreter setting will override that value in spark-defaults.xml. This doesn't make sense, we should only override property in spark-default.xml when you have non-empty value.

```

When there're failed job, developer has to open the travis-ci link and download the log and manually look through to see what was wrong.

This PR make Jenkins not only print build status but also short summary of failure, so developer quickly identify what went wrong. After this patch, Jenkins console output will look something like

### What is this PR for?

Spark 2.4 changed it's Scala version from 2.11.8 to 2.11.12 (see SPARK-24418).

There are two problems for this upgrade at Zeppelin side:

1.. Some methods that are used in private by reflection, for instance, `loopPostInit` became inaccessible.

See:
 - https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.8/src/repl/scala/tools/nsc/interpreter/ILoop.scala
 - https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.12/src/repl/scala/tools/nsc/interpreter/ILoop.scala

To work around this, I manually ported `loopPostInit` at 2.11.8 to retain the behaviour. Some functions that are commonly existing at both Scala 2.11.8 and Scala 2.11.12 are used inside of the new `loopPostInit` by reflection.

2.. Upgrade from 2.11.8 to 2.11.12 requires `jline.version` upgrade. Otherwise, we will hit:
```
Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:
jline.console.completer.CandidateListCompletionHandler.setPrintSpaceAfterFullCompletion(Z)V
  at scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.jline.JLineConsoleReader.initCompletion(JLineReader.scala:139)
```

To work around this, I tweaked this by upgrading jline from `2.12.1` to `2.14.3`.

### What is this PR for?
**New Hazelcast Jet interpreter**

Zeppelin has interpreters for different data processing systems like Flink, Spark, Kylin, Ignite, Geode, Beam, etc.

Hazelcast Jet is a general purpose distributed data processing engine, built on top of Hazelcast for stream/batch processing, comparable if not better in terms of performance to the engine supported by Zeppelin therefore a perfect candidate for a Zeppelin interpreter.

Part of the interpreter is to have a set of utility methods that print out Hazelcast data structures (IMap and ICache) and leverage Zeppelin's built in visualization (%table).

What's more, a nice addition is to have the Hazelcast Jet DAG of the pipeline displayed as a network graph using %network display system.

### What type of PR is it?
* Feature

### Todos
* Utility method to display Hazelcast Jet DAG  using %network
* Review zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license/LICENSE file
* Any feedback from reviewers

### What is the Jira issue?
* [ZEPPELIN-3654]

### How should this be tested?
Manually
* Start the Zeppelin server
* Create a new note with the hazelcastjet interpreter binding
* Write an Hazelcast Jet job as per documentation (docs/interpreter/hazelcastjet.md)

Unit tests
* Run unit tests (HazelcastJetInterpreterTest.java)

### Screenshots (if appropriate)

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update?
Yes, added Apache License for Hazelcast Jet.
* Is there breaking changes for older versions?
No.
* Does this needs documentation?
Yes, it has been added to the PR, see docs/interpreter/hazelcastjet.md.

### What is this PR for?

Notebooks suddenly show up empty (are not loading) and the logfile (apache-zeppelin-dev.log) shows the following error:
```
org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.api.WebSocketException: RemoteEndpoint unavailable, outgoing connection not open
at org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.common.WebSocketSession.getRemote(WebSocketSession.java:252)

It seems that checking the `WebSocketException` after `NotebookSocket.send` will solve this problem .

### What is this PR for?

Trivial PR to add zeppelin-interpreter as provided dependency of zeppelin-interpreter-parent. The purpose it to make intellij work with zeppelin project. Because intellij can not recognize shaded jar so interpreter modules can not recognize zeppelin-interpreter-api. provided dependency won't have effect on the final shaded interpreter jar.

There can be a case where Zeppelin-Sever is running as Form-Based-Authentication, however, it can be running behind a proxy which may be requiring Authorization header.
The idea of this PR is to not clear that header when it behind a proxy and control it with config.

[Bug Fix]

* Make sure that `shiro.ini` is configured to run with `/** = authc`
* In `zeppelin-site.xml` configure `zeppelin.server.authorization.header.clear` as `false`

### What is this PR for?
Notebooks of any size can be exported and saved, but the import facility only accepts notebooks up to 1Mb in size. Allowing notebooks bigger than 1Mb to be saved silently (without any warning or error notification) is therefore a dangerous trap for users.

It has been argued that notebooks bigger than 1Mb are rare and unusual, but a saved notebook also contains the displayed output - and can contain large volumes of tabular data, and even images from matplotlib output. Large notebooks can be common when zeppelin is used for presentation of visual analysis.

This PR adds a popup dialog which is displayed when the user attempts to export a notebook that has a size exceeding 1Mb. A screenshot of the popup is shown below.

### What is this PR for?
This PR continues the discussion and implementation in [PR-2978](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2978) which had to be closed earlier.

This PR prevents the total loss of configuration information that happens when zeppelin attempts to write out modified configuration information into an already full file-system. The approach taken here is to first write the modified information to a temporary file (in the same directory), and then to rename the successfully written file to its eventual name.

The rename operation is not attempted if there is an error while writing the temporary file, thus leaving the pre-existing configuration file untouched.

### What is this PR for?
This PR is trying to introduce paragraph level properties so that user can customize the interpreter behavior in paragraph level.  User can specify the paragraph level properties after the repl name (e.g. `%spark(pool=p1, imageWidth=200)`)

The jdbc interpreter is another example (like `%jdbc(hive)`, but we use other kind of hack method for that before. This PR also update jdbc interpreter to adopt the paragraph level properties.

This PR just allow user to specify paragraph level properties and pass them to interpreter. It is interpreter's responsibility to use these paragraph level properties. So there will be some follow up work to customize interpreter at paragraph level. E.g. allow spark interpreter to specify the queue for paragraph.

### What is this PR for?
This PR allow interpreter override `zeppelin.interpreter.connect.timeout` in zeppelin-site.xml. So that each interpreter can specify its own timeout threshold without restarting the zeppelin server in case he hit the timeout issue. Besides that I change the default timeout to be 60 seconds. This is what zeppelin did before. Although the default timeout is 30 seconds before, but RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess will still wait for 2 times of timeout threshold. So I directly change it to 60 secodns in this PR.

This PR introduce the bi directional RPC framework between ZeppelinServer and InterpreterProcess on top of thrift, see the design doc here. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B_4b7UuvE7RwbfpTjxV2RSxdDeF-p9vXVYC8ace76-Q/edit?usp=sharing

This PR is pretty big, most of the code changes is due to regeneration of thrift code.
Another improvement is introduce the builder pattern of InterpreterContext as the arguments of InterpreterContext constructor is too many.

### What is this PR for?
In 'Create new note' diagram, 'Default Interpreter' is ordered by only interpreter groups.

But interpreter is not ordered in same interpreter group.
(It seems to be ordered by hashcode of 'InterpreterSetting')

When there are many interpreter in same group and this group is first,
user cannot predict what interpreter is showed first.

So I think that interpreter need to be ordered by name.

Problem:
When any external authentication (like LDAP/AD) is enabled for Zeppelin, the default password-based authentication could still be configured in addition to that. This makes space for backdoor in Zeppelin where the user can still get in using the local username/password.

Proposed Solution:
Zeppelin shouldn't allow specifying [users] section in shiro.ini when it is configured to authenticate with LDAP/AD.

Currently, Zeppelin only supports roles for AuthorizationFilter, but there can be a condition as described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2913 where Zeppelin's user does not belong to a group/role, and the administrator wants to have control using user only.

[Feature]

* [x] - Add documentation

* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2913

add the following in shiro.ini:
```
[main]
...
anyofroles = org.apache.zeppelin.utils.AnyOfRolesUserAuthorizationFilter

[urls]
...
/api/interpreter/** = authc, anyofroles[admin, user1]
/api/configurations/** = authc, roles[admin]
/api/credential/** = authc, roles[admin]

With the above config both user (user1) and users the belong to role admin will have access to interpreter setting page.

### What is this PR for?
This PR is a refactoring of the `ZepplinContext` documentation.

The description of `ZepplinContext` is now almost entirely contained within the _Spark_ interpreter's documentation ([spark.md](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/interpreter/spark.md)). But `ZepplinContext` has many generic features that are available to all interpreters, and it is important for `ZepplinContext` to have a more visible and independent presence in the Zeppelin documentation.

### What type of PR is it?
[Documentation]

### Todos

### What is the Jira issue?

### What is this PR for?
This PR enables the interpolation of ZeppelinContext objects into the paragraph text of JDBC cells. It also introduces a new interpreter-level configuration parameter named _zeppelin.jdbc.interpolation_. This new parameter is _false_ by default, and must be set to _true_ to enable object interpolation. The default value of _false_ guarantees backward compatibility for users who are not aware of the new feature.

The implementation takes the same approach that was followed in [PR-2898](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2898).

I have also taken the liberty to correct a preexisting error in the description of the use of Dynamic Forms in the associated documentation (_jdbc.md_).

### What type of PR is it?
[Feature]

### Todos
* [ ] - Task

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3377

### How should this be tested?
CI Pass.

The code in this PR merely causes the JDBC interpreter to ""opt-in"" to the implementation already existing in the `Interpreter` base class - described in [PR-2898](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2898). The unit tests necessary are already present in PR-2898

### Screenshots (if appropriate)

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? No
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No
* Does this needs documentation? Yes, documentation has been added to the file _jdbc.md_. I have also taken the liberty to correct a preexisting error in the description of the use of Dynamic Forms in the associated documentation.

This PR introduces a new configuration property to convert username to lower case. This is useful when the users (from external sources like AD/LDAP) are coming in with mixed-case names and Hadoop services (like Hive) can't authorize them correctly because Hadoop services recognize users only in lower case (like Linux).

Adding a new config option ""zeppelin.username.force.lowercase"" to handle such scenarios.

Behavior without this PR:
Access is denied to CaMel case user while running a Hive paragraph

Behavior with this PR:
User is allowed to run query when proposed configuration set to true.
By default, keeping zeppelin.username.force.lowercase=false to retain the current behavior.

[Bug Fix]

* [ ] - Unit test

* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3312

* Travis CI should pass
* Manual steps to test:
1. Configure Zeppelin with Active Directory authentication
2. Login to Zeppelin as a CaMel case user
3. Try to run a simple JDBC note with a Hive query (like a select * query). This would fail with ""user [CaMel] does not have proper privileges to [USE] operation"" error message.
4. Now set zeppelin.username.force.lowercase=true in custom zeppelin-site.xml configuration.
5. Once again, login as CaMel case user. This time the same Hive query would run as expected. Because the username is now passed in lower case.
6. Also notice that after successful login, the login username (in the top-right corner) will be in lower case too.

* Login as CaMel case user:

### What is this PR for?
When I run all of the tests zeppelin-zengine in IntelliJ, the tests in ShellScriptLauncherTest and SparkInterpreterLaunchTest fail, but if I run these tests by themselves, they pass.
There is a problem with the tests in ShellScripterLauncherTest and SparkInterpreterLaunchTest, which is that if some of the ConfVars are set (such as ZEPPELIN_HOME) in other tests, then these tests will fail, because they expect that these variables are not set.

To fix this, I have added a setUp() method that clears all of the ConfVars to both ShellScripterLauncherTest and SparkInterpreterLauncherTest. This way, none of the ConfVars will be set when these tests are run.

### What is this PR for?
The original purpose of https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2158 was correct processing of ';'. This was done via full removing comments from code.
Unfortunately Apache Phoenix uses hooks in comments https://forcedotcom.github.io/phoenix/#hintml.
Thus we should not delete comments in scripts.
There was discussion about comment rules for different databases (solr). The right way is keep style. Thus analysts can copy queries to another tool and can get same results and errors.

### What is this PR for?

The code in this PR enables embedding/interpolating Z variables into command strings passed to Spark's SQL and Shell interpreters. It implements the functionality described in issue [ZEPPELIN-1967](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1967)

This PR resumes a fresh effort while taking into consideration all of the discussion in the context of the earlier [PR-2502](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2502). The earlier PR-2502 was closed due to a corruption in my repo that could not be corrected.

The code in this PR resolves all of the discussion and suggestions in the body of the earlier [PR-2502](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2502). The following description is a summary of the current implementation:

Patterns of the form `{var-name}` within commands will be interpolated only if a predefined object of the specified name exists in `z`. Additionally, all such patterns within the command line should also be translatable for any interpolation to occur. Partial translation of a command line (where only some of the patterns are translated, and others are not) is never performed.

Patterns of the form `{{any-text}}` are translated into `{any-text}`. This feature is an escaping mechanism that allows `{` and `}` characters to be passed into a command without invoking the interpolation mechanism.

The translations described above are performed only when all occurrences of `{`, `}`, `{{`, and `}}` in any command string conform to one of the two forms described above. A command that contains `{` and/or `}` characters used in any other way (than `{var-name}` and `{{any-text}}` as described above) will be used as-is without attempting any translations whatsoever -- even if the command also contains legal, translate-able and/or escape-able, constructs of the above two forms.

No error is flagged in any case. This behavior is identical to the implementation of a similar feature in
Jupyter's shell invocation using the ! magic command.

At present only the SQL and Shell interpreters support object interpolation.

""Empty Trash"" is not working when multi-user create a notebook and move it to trash.
Because all notebooks are in the same trash folder even though the user doesn't have permission to the notebook, and on clicking ""Empty Trash"" button next to Trash folder, Zeppelin tries to delete all notebooks in the Trash folder, which includes no permission notebook, but cannot delete those because of no permission.

### What is this PR for?
I observed IndexOutOfBoundsException when using zeppelin locally on an existing notebook repository and with fresh interpreter.json file.
The default Zeppelin behavior when using existing notebooks is the manual binding of the interpreter settings, which works fine. This PR simply avoids the IndexOutOfBoundsException.

### What is this PR for?
Spark jobs may change current thread context classloader sometimes.

For example in case of issue ZEPPELIN-2475 using Spark 2.2 and Scala 2.11.8 when you run DepInterpreter that will start SparkILoop --> ILoop which changes the current thread context classloader, from LauncherAppClassloader to ScalaClassloaderURLClassloader. This result in classloading problems when SparkInterpreter is trying to build up Spark Context, in case SparkInterpreter is started by scheduler on same thread.

In short when running subsequent paragraphs, users will get an ambiguous NullPointerException, which is hard to understand as it hides the root cause of the problem. As a safety measure to prevent such cases RemoteInterpreterServer should save & restore original thread context classloader.

Mix as in these two kind of properties:

 - Where key is string and value is object
```
""shell.command.timeout.millisecs"": {

Currently, UI shows an option for version/GIT Control even when it is not supported by the underlying implementing storage configuration.

It is only after users try to save a commit and get an error ""Couldn't checkpoint note revision: possibly storage doesn't support versioning. Please check the logs for more details."".

So, if implementing storage configuration doesn't support git storage, UI should not show those options.

Support saving notebooks to Google Cloud Storage, similar to implementations for S3 and Azure. It uses the same authentication mechanisms as the BigQuery interpreter.

I am new to Maven, so please check my work on the pom.xml files. In particular, I upgraded Guava to 23.0, which was required for `google-cloud-java`. Going through hello-world with my changes seems to work.

Also, I modified the BigQuery interpreter docs to point to the **latest** GCS storage docs. Is it more appropriate to pin to the version you are viewing? How can I do that?

Interpreter setting's name is unique, so it is not necessary to use id to identify it.

### What is this PR for?

The root cause is that in isolated mode interpreters will share the same scheduler. That means when one interpreter is terminated, all the running jobs under the scheduler of this interpreter will be aborted too. This PR will create one scheduler for each session. So when one session is closed, only the running jobs under this session's scheduler is aborted.

### What is this PR for?

Although currently zeppelin has code check style, it is very weak. Such as unused import is not detected. The is the first PR for adding code style check. It just improve the code style check file , but just disable it for now. I have created subtask under ZEPPELIN-3137 for each module.  This `checkstyle.xml` is from spark project. I think code style of spark is also fit for zeppelin project, just remove some spark related content in this `checkstyle.xml`

For now, `FileSystemNotebookRepo`, `FileSystemConfigStorage`, `FileSystemRecoveryStorage` use `FileSystemStorage`, but the singleton pattern means that all the notebook, config and recovery need to be stored in the same storage which might not be proper for some users.

### What is this PR for?
Fixes regression introduced with [ZEPPELIN-3013](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3013). Executing Notebook and
Paragraph via Rest API was not possible anymore, because some parsing
was introduced paragraph.setText(...). The setter was not invoked after
deserialization, thus transient variables paragraph.intpText and paragraph.scriptText were
not set.

This PR fixes that by invoking paragraph.parseText() after deserialization.

Also a test was added, and AbstractTestRestApi.shutdown() method was
overloaded to support the use case of not deleting the interpreter.json
during server restart within one test case.

I sometimes come across the issue that the cron scheduler stops working suddenly. According to the thread dump of ZeppelinServer, all of the DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker threads were waiting for the job's completion and there was no thread to launch a new job.

Here is the contents of the thread dump:

```

The above thread dump says that all of the worker threads get stuck at https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/v0.7.3/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/Notebook.java#L889.

One way to reproduce this kind of issue is creating a paragraph whose status is ""READY"" and ""disable run"". That makes the paragraph status ""READY"" permanently and `note.isTerminated()` never turns to `true`.

To fix this issue, the following two improvements has been made at this PR:

1. Remove the unnecessary `while (!note.isTerminated()) { ... }` block because the execution of all of the paragraphs is finished after `note.runAll()`.
2. Skip the cron execution if there is a running or pending paragraph. That prevents the Zeppelin cron scheduler from getting stuck by the long running paragraph whose execution duration is greater than the cron execution cycle.

### What type of PR is it?
[Bug]

### Todos

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3077

### How should this be tested?
* Tested manually.
    1. The cron scheduler does not get stuck if there is a paragraph whose status is ""READY"" and ""disable run"".
    2. The following message is printed on the log file when the cron job is launched while the previous cron job still has been running.
        * `execution of the cron job is skipped because there is a running or pending paragraph (note id: XXXXXXXXX)`

### Screenshots (if appropriate)

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? No.
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No.
* Does this needs documentation? Yes. The behavior of the cron job was changed not to run if there is a running or pending paragraph by this PR. Thus, the documentation `docs/usage/other_features/cron_scheduler.md` was also added by this PR. Its layout is as follow:

### What is this PR for?
This PR is for the purpose of recover running interpreter process when zeppelin server is restarted. This would be useful when restarting zeppelin without interrupt current running interpreter processes, should be useful when admin do maintenance or upgrading.

Interface `RecoveryStorage` is used for storing the information of running interpreter process.
Currently it only has one implementation `FileSystemRecoveryStorage`, other implementation could be done later (such as zookeeper based). `InterpreterLauncher` is the component where to recover the running interpreter process.

### What is this PR for?
Zeppelin's interpreter setting is shared by all the users and notes, if you want to have different setting you have to create new interpreter, e.g. you can create `spark_jar1` for running spark with dependency jar1 and `spark_jar2` for running spark with dependency jar2.
This approach works, but not so convenient. `ConfInterpreter` can provide more fine-grained control on interpreter setting and more flexibility.

`ConfInterpreter` is a generic interpreter that could be used by any interpreters. The input format should be property file format.

In the first paragraph, we use ConfInterpreter to make custom configuration of spark interpreter (set app name, yarn-client mode & add spark-csv dependencies). Then you can run the second paragraph which use spark-csv.

![conf_interpreter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/164491/33419465-74a3fae8-d5e5-11e7-8b25-76407804d979.png)

It can be used to make custom setting for any interpreter. `ConfInterpreter` would run in the zeppelin server side, it would update the interpreter properties before you launch the interpreter process, so it needs to run before interpreter process launched. And when interpreter process is launched is determined by interpreter mode setting. So users needs to understand the interpreter mode setting of zeppelin and be aware when interpreter process is launched. E.g. If we set spark interpreter setting as isolated per note. Under this setting, each note will launch one interpreter process. In this scenario, user need to put `ConfInterpreter` as the first paragraph as the above example. Otherwise the customized setting can not be applied (The paragraph using ConfInterpreter will report ERROR).

### What is this PR for?
The version of JGit was updated to 4.9.0 at https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2658.

However, this version does not support Java 7 and Travis CI test always fails now: https://travis-ci.org/kjmrknsn/zeppelin/builds/310104872

To fix this issue, downgrade JGit from 4.9.0 to 4.5.4 which is the latest JGit version which supports Java 7: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit.

I confirmed that Travis CI test was passed with JGit 4.5.4: https://travis-ci.org/kjmrknsn/zeppelin/builds/310107611

Now, all PRs to Zeppelin don't pass Travis CI tests, so it's preferable that this PR is merged soon.

     * abstract cass `InterpreterLauncher`

### What is this PR for?
This contribution would to introduce Neo4j Cypher intepreter and at the same time provides base APIs that enable other graph databases (or graph framworks such as GraphX or Giraph).

### What type of PR is it?
[Feature]

### Todos
* [x] - Provide base APIs to manage graph results (under: org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.graph.*)
* [x] - Create the Neo4j intepreter

### What is the Jira issue?
[[ZEPPELIN-2761]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2761)

### How should this be tested?
Donwload and execute [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/?ref=home) v3.x, you can also pull a [Docker image](https://neo4j.com/developer/docker/).

In order to execute test cases, if you are running Java 7, you need to also provide an environment variable telling the tests where to find Java 8, because Neo4j-the-database needs it to run.
```bash
export NEO4J_JAVA=<path/to/java/home>
```

Use this statement to create a dummy dataset
```bash
%neo4j
UNWIND range(1,100) as id
CREATE (p:Person {id:id, name: ""Name "" + id, age: id % 3}) WITH collect(p) as people
UNWIND people as p1
UNWIND range(1,10) as friend
WITH p1, people[(p1.id + friend) % size(people)] as p2
CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS {years: abs(p2.id - p2.id)}]->(p2)
```

Then you can write some simple queries like:
```bash
%neo4j
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:KNOWS]-(p1:Person)
RETURN p, r, p1
LIMIT 10;
```

```bash
%neo4j
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:KNOWS]-(p1:Person)
RETURN p.id AS ID_A, p.name AS NAME_A, r.years AS YEARS, p1.id AS ID_B, p1.name AS NAME_B
LIMIT 20;
```

### What is this PR for?
This is the first version for supporting yarn-cluster of `SparkInterpreter`.   I just delegate all the function to `spark-submit` as yarn-cluster is natively supported by spark, we don't need to reinvent the wheel. But there's still improvement to be done in future, e.g. I put some spark specific logic in `InterpreterSetting` which is not a good practise.  I plan to improve it when I refactor the `Interpreter` class (ZEPPELIN-2685).

Besides that, I also add `MiniHadoopCluster` & `MiniZeppelin` which help for the integration test of yarn-client & yarn-cluster mode, otherwise I have to manually verify yarn-client & yarn-cluster mode which would easily cause regression issue in future.

To be noticed:

* SPARK_HOME must be specified for yarn-cluster mode
* HADOOP_CONF_DIR must be specified for yarn-cluster mode

### What is this PR for?
HTTP Response Headers were being added multiple times. Replacing addHeader method with setHeader overrides the Response Header value with new/existing value instead of adding another duplicate response Header.

### What type of PR is it?
[Bug Fix]

### What is the Jira issue?
* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2896

### How should this be tested?
Open the Zeppelin URL in Chrome Browser. Select ""More Tools"" -> ""Developer Tools"" from the right-side menu. Under Network Section, select the request with name ""localhost"" and check for ""Response Headers"". You should see response headers appearing only once.

### What is this PR for?

This is to integrate livy 0.4.0 which is livy's first apache release. Since the package name is changed, I can not support both livy 0.3.0 and 0.4.0 in the integration test, but since the rest api is not changed. Ideally livy before 0.4.0 should still work.

Regarding the integration test, unfortunately I have to comment out some test due to livy's issue, I will enable it after next livy version release.

### What is this PR for?
This is the first step for implement IPython Interpreter in Zeppelin.  I just use the jupyter_client to create and manage the ipython kernel. We don't need to care about python compilation and execution, all the things are delegated to ipython kernel. Ideally all the features of ipython should be available in Zeppelin as well.

For now, user can use %python.ipython for IPython Interpreter. And if ipython is available, the default python interpreter will use ipython. But user can still set `zeppelin.python.useIPython` as false to enforce to use the old implementation of python interpreter.

Main features:
* IPython interpreter support
** All the ipython features are available, including visualization, ipython magics.
* ZeppelinContext support
* Streaming output support
* Support Ipython in PySpark

Regarding the visualization, ideally all the visualization libraries work in jupyter should also work here.
In unit test, I only verify the following 3 popular visualization library. could add more later.
* matplotlib
* bokeh
* ggplot

### What is this PR for?
This PR is trying to add hdfs as another implementation for `NotebookRepo`. There's another PR about using webhdfs to implement that. Actually hdfs client library is compatibility cross major versions. See http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Compatibility.html#Wire_compatibility, if using webhdfs, the code become more complicated and may lose some features of hdfs.

This PR is also required for HA of zeppelin, so that multiple zeppelin instances can share notes via hdfs.  I add hadoop-client in pom file. So zeppelin will package hadoop client jar into its binary distribution. This is because zeppelin may be installed in a gateway machine where no hadoop is installed (only hadoop configuration file is existed in this machine) And since the hadoop client will work with multiple versions of hadoop, so it is fine to package into binary distribution. Spark also package hadoop client jar in its binary distribution.

###What is this PR for?

in save-as.service.js, if we use URI Data scheme, we could only contain 2MB data in chrome. using the createObjectURL and File API's blob feature, i managed to upgrade the capacity to about 900MB. plus this update is better in debugging too. if we exceed the 2MB limit in URI data scheme, the download just failed with no accurate console log originally, so it was kinda hard to know why this happens. But using this technique, if it exceeds the 900MB limit, the console log points directly about what the problem is. like this : Uncaught RangeError: Failed to construct 'Blob': Array length exceeds supported limit.

https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-web/src/app/notebook/save-as/save-as.service.js

###What type of PR is it?

Improvement

###Todos

nothing more i guess

###What is the Jira issue?

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2850

###How should this be tested?

open zeppelin using chrome. make a table by select, then download it by csv or tsv. the table should be BIG, like really big, (but not that big for companies, which is my case) to test. in the original version if the whole data exceeds 2MB, you could see that the download fails. but using my script, it doesn't fail until it reaches about 900MB~1GB, which is a tremendous improvement.

###Screenshots (if appropriate)

i'll post it later if you really need it. but i'm pretty sure you guys know what i'm talking about :)

Does the licenses files need update? no (i guess)
Is there breaking changes for older versions? no

### What is this PR for?
The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) is a security feature that lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.
Note: The Strict-Transport-Security header is ignored by the browser when your site is accessed using HTTP; this is because an attacker may intercept HTTP connections and inject the header or remove it. When your site is accessed over HTTPS with no certificate errors, the browser knows your site is HTTPS capable and will honor the Strict-Transport-Security header.

The HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### What is this PR for?

For now we spark configuration at runtime rather than pass them through `--conf`, it would cause several issues.
- Some configuration has to be set through --conf, otherwise we need to duplicate code in SparkSubmit.scala (spark.yarn.keytab, spark.yarn.principal)
- Some configuration would conflict with spark-defaults.conf. If you specify spark.master as yarn-client in spark-defaults.conf but specify spark.master as local in zeppelin side, you will see the spark interpreter fail to start due to this inconsistency.
- As ZEPPELIN-1460 described, it is hard to figure what is the effective configuration.
- We can not use yarn-cluster mode although it is not supported now, but I think it is necessary to do that as zeppelin needs to support multiple users.

This PR would pass all the spark related configuration to spark-submit through `--conf`, so that it is easy to know and guarantee that configuration on zeppelin interpreter setting take precedence over spark-defaults.conf.  And it is also good for maintenance that upstream change (any change about configuration in spark) would not affect us.

### What is this PR for?

We have improved zeppelin-web, but some parts are still messy. As part of keeping zeppelin-web module healthy ([ZEPPELIN-2725](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2725)), I suggest having these file structure. (Refer the screenshot section)

Here are few reasons.

- unified directory, file name helps us to recognize, find which part we should modify / fix
  * Let's say we need to modify the resize feature of paragraph, where the developer can find it? currently, it's under `component/resizable` not under `paragraph/resizeable` and also it's not the shareable component. There is no reason to keep that files in `component/**`
- [this structure](https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide#file-naming-conventions) is what the angularjs community has verified for few years. so newly joined developers can feel more comfortable.
- this is necessary for [Modular archiecture](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2750) and it eventually helps us to make a smooth transition toward next technologies (even whatever we will use)

Additionally,

- This is not the meaningless refactoring PR and doesn't block developing new features / fixes (Please refer the `Some Details` section)
- I will handle conflicts for few days would be brought by other WIPs

#### Some Details

- Didn't change the widely used variable names not to make many conflicts. For example, `websocketMsgSrv`, `arrayOrderingSrv`
- Since there are helium packages already published, didn't change the HTML file names like `pivot_setting.html` (it's better to use `pivot-setting.html` if we following the rule)

### What is this PR for?

This PR intends to make Flink interpreter able to distribute external dependencies on cluster when they are loaded by Web UI.

The code simply collects jar paths downloaded by DependecyResolver and add them to FlinkILoop constructor.

Loading external dependencies in Flink interpreter only work with MiniCluster and Flink version lower than 1.3.0. Only Spark is able to distribute jars at the moment.

### What type of PR is it?

Improvement

### What is the Jira issue?

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2675

### How should this be tested?

1. [Download Flink](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) and run local cluster with following command:

```./bin/start-cluster.sh```

2. go to the interpreter page and in dependencies section add artifact:

```joda-time:joda-time:jar:2.9.9```

3.  change `local` with `localhost` in interpreter page

4. run below code in paragraph

```
%flink
import org.joda.time.{DateTime, DateTimeZone}

val text = benv.fromElements(""To be or not to be"")
text
  .flatMap { _.toLowerCase.split("" "") }
  .map(word => (word, new DateTime(System.currentTimeMillis(), DateTimeZone.UTC) ))
  .print()

### What is this PR for?
This is to apply new KerberosInterpreter mechanism to JDBCInterpreter for relogin from keytab, instead of on fail relogin.

### What type of PR is it?
[Refactoring]

### What is the Jira issue?
* [ZEPPELIN-2698](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2698)

### How should this be tested?
In JDBC interpreter setting add following properties
- zeppelin.jdbc.auth.type = KERBEROS
- zeppelin.jdbc.principal = principal value
- zeppelin.jdbc.keytab.location = keytab location

Now try and run any of hive's query (say `show tables`) it should return with valid results.
Again, wait for this kerberos ticket to expire (usually its 24hrs) then try the above again, and it should work.

### What is this PR for?
This PR is for a showing dialog when note's permission set `Readers/Writers` but `Owners` is empty.
Currently, after merged #849, if user set `Owners` is empty, it's automatically set as the current user.
So, It would be better to show a dialog before `Owners` is fill with the current user because user might think it is not intended.

Plus, if a user only set `Readers` role, all field(`Writers` and `Owners`) role is filled as the current user like below. It's not necessary to fill because the `Owner` role can read and write note.

### What is this PR for?
Problem:
While performing LDAP authentication, current Shiro module does a group=* search while trying to get group-to-role mapping for any LDAP user. On a large LDAP directory, this is a serious problem which might render RolesByGroup feature not working as expected.

Fix:
Currently while doing LDAP authentication, there is no available option to limit the group search results to the only groups that user is interested in. This bug addresses the same and adds group search filter to Shiro configuration for LdapRealm which will allow user to define a search filter and limit the group search results.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### What is the Jira issue?
* [ZEPPELIN-2657] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2657

### How should this be tested?
1. Use org.apache.zeppelin.realm.LdapRealm as Shiro realm
2. In the shiro_ini configruation, define a group search filter like this:
ldapRealm.groupSearchFilter = (&(objectclass=groupofnames)(member={0}))
or
ldapRealm.groupSearchFilter = (&(objectclass=groupofnames)(cn=zeppelin-users*))
3. Also define other LdapRealm parameters as necessary like rolesByGroup etc.
4. When an LDAP user, who is part of the group that matches filter above, logs in, then the roles are applied. If the LDAP user is not part these defined groups, then the roles are not applied.

Roles are not getting honored from shiro_ini for setting permissions in Zeppelin notebook when securityManager.realm is set to $activeDirectoryRealm

### What type of PR is it?
[Bug Fix]

### Todos
* [x] - Create JIRA

### What is the Jira issue?
* [ZEPPELIN-2640](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2640)

### How should this be tested?
Use the below-attached shiro.ini, the thing which is different is `securityManager.realm = $activeDirectoryRealm`. When this is used, Zeppelin does not set the roles that were assigned to that particular user.

```
[main]
activeDirectoryRealm = org.apache.zeppelin.realm.ActiveDirectoryGroupRealm
activeDirectoryRealm.systemUsername = CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM
activeDirectoryRealm.systemPassword = Password1!
activeDirectoryRealm.searchBase = CN=Users,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM
activeDirectoryRealm.url = ldap://ad-nano.mydomain.com:389
activeDirectoryRealm.groupRolesMap = ""CN=zeppelin,OU=groups,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM"":""admin"",""CN=finance,OU=groups,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM"":""finance""
activeDirectoryRealm.authorizationCachingEnabled = true

securityManager.realm = $activeDirectoryRealm

sessionManager = org.apache.shiro.web.session.mgt.DefaultWebSessionManager
cacheManager = org.apache.shiro.cache.MemoryConstrainedCacheManager
securityManager.cacheManager = $cacheManager
securityManager.sessionManager = $sessionManager
securityManager.sessionManager.globalSessionTimeout = 86400000
shiro.loginUrl = /api/login

[urls]
/api/version = anon
/** = authc
```

So, before this PR if you `tail -f zeppelin-<username>-<machine-name>.local.log` in the log you will see this line
` WARN [2017-06-12 12:42:06,620] ({qtp226744878-19} LoginRestApi.java[postLogin]:119) - {""status"":""OK"",""message"":"""",""body"":{""principal"":""zeppelin"",""ticket"":""4b1e513f-7736-4474-b2d6-259ff3d39f91"",""roles"":""[]""}}`

And after applying this PR you will be able to see the role that got assigned to this user i.e.
` WARN [2017-06-12 12:42:06,620] ({qtp226744878-19} LoginRestApi.java[postLogin]:119) - {""status"":""OK"",""message"":"""",""body"":{""principal"":""zeppelin"",""ticket"":""4b1e513f-7736-4474-b2d6-259ff3d39f91"",""roles"":""[admin]""}}`

### What is this PR for?
Improved shiro.ini.template.

Since the file is just a template, it should be such that if the user copies it from shiro.ini.template to shiro.ini the auth settings are comparable conservative.
Hence: The admin user has been commented out to avoid enabling admin by
default with a default password.

In addition, the comment in the url section was misleading. It has been clarified. The comment ""To enfore security, comment the line below and uncomment the next one“ was
misleading, since the setting was already on ""authc"" and it was not the ""line below"". This has been fixed.

### What is this PR for?
Currently allowing authentication for selected roles/groups of an LDAP realm is not possible. The LDAPRealm allows for mapping of roles to groups but only allows authorization on URLs with respect to groups. No group based checks are carried out during authentication. This PR allows for group based authentication using LdapRealm.

Build and configure `shiro.ini` to use the LdapRealm and verify that the realm works as before along with the added functionality of allowing only certain user groups for authentication if the `allowedRolesForAuthentication` config is set in the init. If this configuration is absent authentication should work as before without verifying roles. A sample shiro.ini is pasted here for testing purposes.

There are some problems if meta is large (few schemas, each schema contains 500+ tables etc.).
Problems:

1. loading is very long
2. each update takes one connection if updates are long, the situation may arise that the entire pool will be busy
3. no cache
This PR solves these problems. Added cache and access by full path (schema.table, schema.table.column) + protection for release the connections

### What is this PR for?
`Visualization` class should throw an error if an abstract method is not implemented just like [`SpellBase`](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-web/src/app/spell/spell-base.js#L25) does.

And I added some comments. In my opinion, though `Visualization` has [a good example](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.8.0-SNAPSHOT/development/writingzeppelinvisualization.html), it needs an API documentation page (`Spell` as well). `Visualization` class has methods which can be overridden (e.g. `refresh`, `destroy`, etc.), but the example doesn't mention them. Therefore, users don't know what and how to implement easily!

### What is this PR for?
Basically what happens is, if a user login using full name with suffix then the user impersonation fails, as the HDFS expects username without the suffix.
This is because the username is passed to underlying components with suffix and got rejected in security layer with IllegalArgumentException

This PR fixes a security hole in documentation when 'SIMPLE' authentication mechanism is defined in Shiro configuration (http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.8.0-SNAPSHOT/security/shiroauthentication.html).

### What is the Jira issue?

[ZEPPELIN-2520](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2520)

### How should this be tested?

1. Build: `mvn clean package -DskipTests;`
2. Execute a paragraph using this text.

```md
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

### What is this PR for?
When running `%sql` paragraphs sometimes a NullPointer is thrown instead of presenting the result.

This was traced back to `sparkInterpreter.getZeppelinContext().setInterpreterContext(context);` not being called as expected from SparkSqlInterpreter. Since the SparkInterpreter is used from the SparkSqlInterpreter, if a `%spark` paragraph is executed before a `%sql` paragraph it works as expected (as SparkInterpreter sets the interpreter context in the zeppelin context).

### What type of PR is it?
[Hot Fix]

### Todos

### What is the Jira issue?
Hotfix

### How should this be tested?
Start the spark context by executing
```

### What is this PR for?
Second travis job didn't work correctly. It suppose to test all core unit tests plus integration test (except for spark related test) but it was doing nothing.

It was because of the exclamation mark in **-Dtest** property:
```
-Dtest='!ZeppelinSparkClusterTest,!org.apache.zeppelin.spark.*'
```
which is not supported by maven-surefire-plugin of version 2.17 (which is used in Zeppelin). Exclamation mark is supported started from 2.19 but still does not work properly.

I've added plugin **exclude** configuratin instead of **-Dtest** property.

After travis job was restored I had found that not all core tests were working properly. I have excluded them from the travis job for now and created jira issues:

### What is this PR for?
With ZEPPELIN-2288 we restored the check of the Origin field for websocket requests.

Unfortunately the current implementation will deny the request if the Origin HTTP header is empty, even if the zeppelin.server.allowed.origins is *

This patch enables websocket requests without Origin in the HTTP header if the zeppelin.server.allowed.origins=*. This fixes the work behind a restrictive reverse proxy (or behind Apache Knox)

### What is the Jira issue?

[ZEPPELIN-1711](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1711)

### How should this be tested?

1. build base image `cd scripts/docker/zeppelin/base; docker build -t zeppelin:base ./`
2. build bin image `cd scripts/docker/zeppelin/0.7.1; docker build -t zeppelin:0.7.1 ./`
3. execute docker images

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 --rm --name zeppelin zeppelin:0.7.1
```

since it takes time to build, you can use already [published docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/1ambda/docker-zeppelin/)

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 --rm --name zeppelin 1ambda/docker-zeppelin:0.7.1
```

4. should be able to run spark, python and R tutorials

### Screenshots (if appropriate)

NO

### Implementation Details

Since [headroom](wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js/) functionality makes integration tests fail,
we can't use `headroom` for CI build. to resolve this issue,

- created new maven profiles: `web-ci` and `web-dist` (default)
- maven will execute `yarn run build:ci` with the `web-ci` profile which doesn't include headroom in `app.js`

## What is this PR for?

We sometimes can not delete a note, or we will be accompanied by an NPE for deleting a note.

This problem occurs when:
When interpreter.json 's note binding is wrong, or there is a problem.
If you are configuring an interpreter that is not through zeppelin's user interface.
As a result, it happens when synchronization of notes deletion and setting retention is not normal.
Therefore, we should add handling for note deletion and exception handling for nonexistent interpreter bindings.
It reduces the synchronization problem of interpreter.json.

### What type of PR is it?
Bug Fix

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2431

### How should this be tested?
1. zeppelin stop
2. edit con/interpreter.json and `interpreterBindings`
  fix any notes or incorrect information.
  for example
  ```
    },
  ""interpreterBindings"": {
    ""2CFS9YSM5"": [
      ""2CFRR1D3TINVALIDINVALIDINVALID"", <-- edit
      ""2CFZ1JKUR"",
      ""2CEAJK1VW"",
      ""2CGSESWBH"",
      ""2CERNPGW5"",
   }
  ```
3. zeppelin start
4. You can try remove invalid interpreter bind note on web. (on example = `2CFS9YSM5`)

result :
If the modifications to this PR are not reflected,
It will not be deleted or an error will appear on the server.
Also, the interpreterBindings information in interpreter.json does not respond to delete events.

The script previously modified the CLASSPATH variable. This may lead to
an undesired side effect, where the zeppelin server classpath is

ZEPPELIN-2375 for details. Instead of modifying classpath we now work
the other way around and set ZEPPELIN_CLASSPATH or
ZEPPELIN_INT_CLASSPATH to include CLASSPATH and then use
ZEPPELIN_CLASSPATH or ZEPPELIN_INT_CLASSPATH in the corresponding exec
(runner), respectively.

…ad of uri.

### What is this PR for?

Fixing issue ZEPPELIN-2410:

The previous version of this file used the full uri as file name in the
cache. This included special characters like the : in http: which
caused problems.

Since this is just a cache file, a better approach is to use an UUID.

The UUID is constructed from the URI to avoid the cache dir to grow
over time (in case there is no clean up of the cache dir).

### What is this PR for?
When `interpreter.close()` occurs in code it shuts down _RemoteInterpreterEventPoller_ and then tries to close thrift connection. While closing thrift client will wait until events queue is empty. If _RemoteInterpreterEventPoller_ has not processed all thrift events before the shutdown signal comes, thrift client will wait forever. As a result Travis will terminate the build after code is not responding for 10 minutes.

### What type of PR is it?
[Bug Fix]

### Todos
We need to:
* [x] - write a test that checks that event queue is empty after _RemoteInterpreterEventPoller_ is done,
* [x] - clear unread events on _RemoteInterpreterEventPoller_ shutdown signal.

### What is the Jira issue?

### How should this be tested?
This issue can be reprodused if you put `Thread.sleep(3000L);` to  _RemoteInterpreterEventPoller.java_
```
...
} else if (event.getType() == RemoteInterpreterEventType.OUTPUT_UPDATE_ALL) {
    Thread.sleep(3000L);

### What is this PR for?
This bug happens when you save your note, and restart zeppelin and run it again. The root cause is that the angular object miss  AngularObjectListener which means you can not sync up the changes on angular object to frontend. This PR would restore the listener correctly when we restore the angular objects saved before.  Also make some changes for logging in this PR.

- otherwise, changes in angular controller scope values will not affect on the directives even though events are fired. (`show.bs.dropdown`, `hide.bs.dropdown`)

### What is this PR for?

Currently, zeppelin only support 3 kinds of dynamic form controls: TextBox, Select, CheckBox. All the things are in `Input.java`, this is hard to add new controls, this PR is for refactoring Input to make dynamic forms extensible.  Main Changes:
* Make `Input` as the base class of dynamic forms also use it as the factory class
* All the concret dynamic forms extend `Input`
* Add method `toJson` and `fromJson` for `GUI` for `GUI`'s serialization/deserialization. I plan to do it for other classes as well, so that we can remove duplicated serde code and also make it easy to test serialization/deserialization
* Change `z.input` to `z.textbox` as I think z.input is a little misleading. But I still keep `z.input` and make `z.input` as deprecated.
* Ideally the new input forms' json should be the same as the old input form json. But there's one bug in the old input form, `type` is missing if the input forms are created in frontend for textbox and select. So I keep the old input forms for compatibility. I will load the old input forms json and convert it into new input forms, and after saving, `note.json` would have the new input forms json.

After this PR, user needs to do 3 things to add new ui controls
* Implement its UI control classes, (refer TextBox/CheckBox/Select), and specify it in `TypeAdapterFactory` of `Input` for serde.
* Add parsing logic in `Input.getInputForm` if you want to support this control in frontend.
* Add display logic in `paragraph-parameterizedQueryForm.html`

### What is this PR for?
If using the `multiChartBar`, it often occurs overlap in text. So, this PR is for preventing to overlap in text.

>~~The below is the case what I updated.~~
~~1. The xLabel generally show all of the text without rotation (less than 30).~~
~~2. If the xLabel size is over than 30 and less than 80, the xLabel text are rotated as 90 degree and displayed.~~
~~3. If the xLabel size is over than 80, the xLabel text are disappeared, but the tooltip is displayed.~~
>~~I have made improvements based on my thinking, so I would appreciate to give me your feedback.~~
~~And if merged this PR, I'll update the feature so that user can use `min` and `max` variables by user on web.~~

**[Update]**
To prevent overlap in xLabel text, in one way which is talked the below mentions, user who is using zeppelin could select to visualization type of xLabel such as `rotate 45 degree` or `hide`.

### What is this PR for?
I can reproduce it via the test code in ZeppelinIT.testAngularDisplay. First run the 4 paragraphs to initiate the state. Then when I click paragraph 0 the first time, paragraph 2 will run correctly. But if I click paragraph 0 again, interpreter would raise the following exception. The cause is that ZeppelinContext's interpreterContext now point to paragraph 2, because paragraph 2 is the last paragraph that runs in this interpreter. So I propose to add parameter for check running current paragraph in ZeppelinContext.

* Add 2 methods in ZeppelinContext.   `run(idx, checkCurrentParagraph) `, 'run(noteId, idx, context, checkCurrentParagraph)'
* Also make some changes for debug logging.

### What is this PR for?
Currently it is not convenient to access the individual item of the return value of z.checkbox, I would propose to return `Seq` for `SparkInterpreter` and `list` for `PySparkInterpreter`.  This might cause some incompatibility, but I think it is acceptable considering the benefits.  Besides that, before this PR, all the items of checkbox would be checked by default in `PySparkInterpreter` which is inconsistent with `SparkInterpreter`, so I change it to nothing is selected by default in this PR.

### What is this PR for?

`AdvancedTransformation` has more detailed options while providing existing features of `PivotTransformation` and `ColumnselectorTransformation` which Zeppelin already has

![av_in_30sec](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4968473/24037330/c9478e86-0b40-11e7-9886-1ffb85042a7a.gif)

Here are some features which advanced-transformation can provide.

1. **(screenshot)** multiple sub charts
2. **(screenshot)** parameter widgets: `input`, `checkbox`, `option`, `textarea`
3. **(screenshot)** expand/fold axis and parameter panels
4. **(screenshot)** clear axis and parameter panels
5. **(screenshot)** remove duplicated columns in an axis
6. **(screenshot)** limit column count in an axis
7. configurable char axes: `valueType`, `axisType`, `description`, ...
8. configurable chart parameters
9. lazy transformation
10. parsing parameters automatically based on their type: `int`, `float`, `string`, `JSON`
11. multiple transformation methods
12. re-initialize whole configuration based on spec hash.
13. **(screenshot)** shared axis

#### API Details: Spec

`AdvancedTransformation` requires `spec` which includes axis and parameter details for charts.

- Let's create 2 sub-charts called `simple-line` and `step-line`.
- Each sub chart can have different `axis` and `parameter` depending on their requirements.

```js
  constructor(targetEl, config) {
    super(targetEl, config)

    const spec = {
      charts: {
        'simple-line': {
          sharedAxis: true, /** set if you want to share axes between sub charts, default is `false` */
          axis: {
            'xAxis': { dimension: 'multiple', axisType: 'key', },
            'yAxis': { dimension: 'multiple', axisType: 'aggregator'},
            'category': { dimension: 'multiple', axisType: 'group', },
          },
          parameter: {
            'xAxisUnit': { valueType: 'string', defaultValue: '', description: 'unit of xAxis', },
            'yAxisUnit': { valueType: 'string', defaultValue: '', description: 'unit of yAxis', },
            'dashLength': { valueType: 'int', defaultValue: 0, description: 'the length of dash', },
          },
        },

        'step-line': {
          axis: {
            'xAxis': { dimension: 'single', axisType: 'unique', },
            'yAxis': { dimension: 'multiple', axisType: 'value', },
          },
          parameter: {
            'xAxisUnit': { valueType: 'string', defaultValue: '', description: 'unit of xAxis', },
            'yAxisUnit': { valueType: 'string', defaultValue: '', description: 'unit of yAxis', },
            'noStepRisers': { valueType: 'boolean', defaultValue: false, description: 'no risers in step line', widget: 'checkbox', },
        },

      },
    }

    this.transformation = new AdvancedTransformation(config, spec)
  }
```

####  API Details: Axis Spec

| Field Name | Available Values (type) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`dimension` | `single` | Axis can contains only 1 column |
|`dimension` | `multiple` | Axis can contains multiple columns |
|`axisType` | `key` | Column(s) in this axis will be used as `key` like in `PivotTransformation`. These columns will be served in `column.key` |
|`axisType` | `aggregator` | Column(s) in this axis will be used as `value` like in `PivotTransformation`. These columns will be served in `column.aggregator` |
|`axisType` | `group` | Column(s) in this axis will be used as `group` like in `PivotTransformation`. These columns will be served in `column.group` |
|`axisType` | (string) | Any string value can be used here. These columns will be served in `column.custom` |
|`maxAxisCount` | (int) | The maximum column count that this axis can contains. (unlimited if `undefined`) |
|`valueType` | (string) | Describe the value type just for annotation |

Here is an example.

```js
          axis: {
            'xAxis': { dimension: 'multiple', axisType: 'key',  },
            'yAxis': { dimension: 'multiple', axisType: 'aggregator'},
            'category': { dimension: 'multiple', axisType: 'group', maxAxisCount: 2, valueType: 'string', },
          },
```

####  API Details: Parameter Spec

| Field Name | Available Values (type) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`valueType` | `string` | Parameter which has string value |
|`valueType` | `int` | Parameter which has int value |
|`valueType` | `float` | Parameter which has float value |
|`valueType` | `boolean` | Parameter which has boolean value used with `checkbox` widget usually |
|`valueType` | `JSON` | Parameter which has JSON value used with `textarea` widget usually. `defaultValue` should be `""""` (empty string). This ||`defaultValue` | (any) | Default value of this parameter. `JSON` type should have `""""` (empty string) |
|`description` | (string) | Description of this parameter. This value will be parsed as HTML for pretty output |
|`widget` | `input` |  Use [input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) widget. This is the default widget (if `widget` is undefined)|
|`widget` | `checkbox` |  Use [checkbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) widget. |
|`widget` | `textarea` |  Use [textarea](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) widget. |
|`widget` | `option` |  Use [select + option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) widget. This parameter should have `optionValues` field as well. |
|`optionValues` | (Array<string>) |  Available option values used with the `option` widget |

Here is an example.

```js
parameter: {
  // string type, input widget
  'xAxisUnit': { valueType: 'string', defaultValue: '', description: 'unit of xAxis', },

  // boolean type, checkbox widget
  'inverted': { widget: 'checkbox', valueType: 'boolean', defaultValue: false, description: 'invert x and y axes', },

  // string type, option widget with `optionValues`
  'graphType': { widget: 'option', valueType: 'string', defaultValue: 'line', description: 'graph type', optionValues: [ 'line', 'smoothedLine', 'step', ], },

  // HTML in `description`
  'dateFormat': { valueType: 'string', defaultValue: '', description: 'format of date (<a href=""https://docs.amcharts.com/3/javascriptcharts/AmGraph#dateFormat"">doc</a>) (e.g YYYY-MM-DD)', },

  // JSON type, textarea widget
  'yAxisGuides': { widget: 'textarea', valueType: 'JSON', defaultValue: '', description: 'guides of yAxis ', },
```

#### API Details: Transformer Spec

`AdvancedTransformation` supports 3 transformation methods. The return value will depend on the transformation method type.

```js
    const spec = {
      charts: {
        'simple': {
          /** default value of `transform.method` is the flatten cube.  */
          axis: { ... },
          parameter: { ... }
        },

        'cube-group': {
          transform: { method: 'cube', },
          axis: { ... },
          parameter: { ... },
        }

        'no-group': {
          transform: { method: 'raw', },
          axis: { ... },
          parameter: { ... },
        }
```

| Field Name | Available Values (type) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`method` | `object` |  designed for [amcharts: serial](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/date-based-data/) |
|`method` | `array` | designed for [highcharts: column](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/column-basic/) |
|`method` | `drill-down` | designed for [highcharts: drill-down](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/column-drilldown/) |
|`method` | `raw` | will return the original `tableData.rows` |

Whatever you specified as `transform.method`, the `transformer` value will be always function for lazy computation.

```js
// advanced-transformation.util#getTransformer

  if (transformSpec.method === 'raw') {
    transformer = () => { return rows; }
  } else if (transformSpec.method === 'array') {
    transformer = () => {
      ...
      return { ... }
    }
  }

```

#### Feature Details: Automatic parameter parsing

Advanced transformation will parse parameter values automatically based on their type: `int`, `float`, `string`, `JSON`

- See also `advanced-transformation-util.js#parseParameter`

#### Feature Details: re-initialize the whole configuration based on spec hash

```js
// advanced-transformation-util#initializeConfig

  const currentVersion = JSON.stringify(spec)
  if (!config.spec || !config.spec.version || config.spec.version !== currentVersion) {
    spec.version = currentVersion
    // reset config...
  }
```

#### Feature Details: Shared Axes

If you set `sharedAxis` to `true` in chart specification, then these charts will share their axes. (default is `false`)

```js
    const spec = {
      charts: {
        'column': {
          transform: { method: 'array', },
          sharedAxis: true,
          axis: { ... },
          parameter: { ... },
        },

        'stacked': {
          transform: { method: 'array', },
          sharedAxis: true,
          axis: { ... }
          parameter: { ... },
        },
```

![sharedaxis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4968473/24207116/6999ad8a-0f63-11e7-8b61-273b712612fc.gif)

#### API Details: Usage in Visualization#render()

Let's assume that we want to create 2 sub-charts called `basic` and `no-group`.

- https://github.com/1ambda/zeppelin-ultimate-line-chart (an practical example)

```js
  drawBasicChart(parameter, column, transformer) {
    const { ... } = transformer()
  }

  drawNoGroupChart(parameter, column, transformer) {
    const { ... } = transformer()
  }

  render(data) {
    const { chart, parameter, column, transformer, } = data

    if (chart === 'basic') {
      this.drawBasicChart(parameter, column, transformer)
    } else if (chart === 'no-group') {
      this.drawNoGroupChart(parameter, column, transformer)
    }
  }
```

### What is this PR for?
Currently users who build Zeppelin from source need to include `-Pyarn` build profile to enable Yarn for embedded local Spark. This PR is to remove `-Pyarn` and make Yarn related libraries can be automatically downloaded without the profile during build time.

### What type of PR is it?
just removed Yarn build profile in `spark-dependencies/pom.xml`

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-2373](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2373)

### How should this be tested?
1. apply this patch and build Zeppelin with below command
```
mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl 'zeppelin-server, spark-dependencies, spark' --am
```

2. check `spark-yarn_${scala.binary.version}.jar` is downloaded(or included) during build time
```
[INFO] Including org.apache.spark:spark-yarn_2.10:jar:2.1.0 in the shaded jar.
```
In current master, the above line won't be shown if you don't use `-Pyarn` build profile. But with this patch, it will be shown without the profile.

### What is this PR for?

Bundle helium packages one by one because

#### Summary

Let's say you have one helium package called `ultimate-line-chart`.

**1. Package Path**

- **(before)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/node_modules/ultimate-line-chart`
- **(after)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/bundles/ultimate-line-chart`

**2. Zeppelin Local Module Path**

- **(before)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/node_modules/zeppelin-tabledata`
- **(after)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/local_modules/zeppelin-tabledata`

**3. Bundle Cache Path**

- **(before)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/helium.bundle.cache.js` (mixed one)
- **(after)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/bundles/ultimate-line-chart/helium.bundle.cache.js` (for each helium package)

#### Details

- Bundling them in one file is not good idea because the whole bundling is broken when only 1 bundle fails
- Some node packages might not installed correctly. For example, `amchart/amcharts3` will be installed in `helium-bundles/node_modules/my-helium-vis/node_modules` but `amchart-export` will be placed in `helium-bundles/node_modules` so `my-helium-vis` can't import `amchart-export`. (This is real case)
- Additionally, I used yarn to install required node_modules. separated bundling requires install same dependencies multiple times. This takes more time than before and npm is too slow to install them all.
- Install Zeppelin framework modules using [local path](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#local-paths). It's more safe and correct way to install local modules.

* add a configuration item  zeppelin.jdbc.auth.kerberos.proxy.enable to disable kerberos behaviour
as we know， in current version of zeppelin， if we have kerberos auth configured，and using zeppelin with a user login，the jdbc interpreter will do a proxy behavior with the login user automatically，but in many cases， we do not want do this，and we do not want bind the zeppelin user system with kerberos auth system.

### What is this PR for?
Currently users who build Zeppelin from source need to include `-Psparkr` to use `%r` with embedded local Spark. But it's quite inconvenient to write this build profile every time we build i think. So I removed `-Psparkr` and make `r` related libraries automatically downloaded when we build Zeppelin like I did #2213

### What type of PR is it?

2. Build source with below command

Aftr this step, there will be `R` dir under `ZEPPELIN_HOME/interpreter/spark`. Before this PR, only `dep` dir and `zeppelin-spark_2.10-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` is generated without `-Psparkr` build profile.

4. Restart Zeppelin. To make sure, run R tutorial note under `Zeppelin Tutorial` folder

It should be run successfully without any error

### What is this PR for?
Currently ""see more"" is placed next to the older version of INTERPRETER type of Helium pkg. But other type of Helium pkg(e.g. SPELL or VISUALIZATION) has ""enable"". And if we click ""enable"", can see the dialog for asking if you want to enable the package or not. So I changed INTERPRETER type pkg's ""see more"" to ""enable"" for the consistency in this patch.

Improvement

1. Run Zeppelin web under `zeppelin-web` with
```
$ yarn run dev
```

2. Go to Helium menu and click any interpreter type of package
3. Click `versions`
4. there should be ""enable"" not ""see more""

### What is this PR for?

This pull request fixes two issues regarding paragraphs not being updated and therefore overwritten unintentionally. The first issue yields to local changes being overwritten when remote changes are made. The second issue yields to changes being overwritten when, e.g., the notebook is renamed.

The first change happens in the `updateParagraph` broadcast event handler function. This function has the purpose to update the local state of the paragraph in the paragraph controller scope when there is an update from the web socket.

However, it did not update the state if the only thing that has changed was the text. Now it will, which fixes the original issue in the issue description. This was one of the issues identified by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1492?focusedCommentId=15744928&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15744928

The second issue is fixed by saving the paragraph when the editor loses focus.

### What type of PR is it?

Bug Fix

### What is the Jira issue?

- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1492

### How should this be tested?

The first issue can be reproduced with the following two browser-windows and a single notebook.

Browser A:

```
%pyspark
print ""Original Zeppelin Notebook""
```

In Browser B, edit the notebook and the above command to:

```
%pyspark
print ""Notebook is updated....""
```

If I run the notebook via browser A followed by Browser B, everything is updated nicely. Now also if I you add the following line to the Notebook though Browser B:

```
print ""....once again""
```

and run the notebook through Browser B again, the content in Browser A will be updated.

The second issue can be reproduced by editing a cell without executing it and renaming the notebook right afterwards. The rename will reset your cell to the previous state. With the fix, your state is saved.

### What is this PR for?
Currently users who build Zeppelin from source need to include `-Ppyspark` to use `%pyspark` with embedded local Spark. But it's quite inconvenient to write this build profile every time we build i think. So I removed `-Ppyspark` and make pyspark related libraries automatically downloaded when we build Zeppelin.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### Todos
* [x] - remove the rest of `-Ppyspark` build profile in `dev/create_release.sh`, `dev/publish_release.sh`, and `docs/install/build.md` after getting feedback

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-2298](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2298)

### How should this be tested?
1. Apply this patch
2. Build source with below command
```
mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl 'zeppelin-interpreter, zeppelin-zengine, zeppelin-server, zeppelin-display, spark, spark-dependencies'

```
Aftr this step, there will be `pyspark` dir under `ZEPPELIN_HOME/interpreter/spark`. Before this PR, only `dep` dir and `zeppelin-spark_2.10-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` is generated without `-Ppyspark` build profile.

4. Restart Zeppelin. To make sure, run any python code e.g.
```
%pyspark
print(""Hello ""+z.input(""name""))
```
It should be run successfully without any error

2. Build \w below command and restart Zeppelin server
```
 $ mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl 'zeppelin-zengine, zeppelin-server, zeppelin-interpreter'
```

3. Start web dev server under `ZEPPELIN_HOME/zeppelin-web` and browse `localhost:9000`
```
$ yarn run dev
```

4. Go to Helium menu -> Click `INTERPRETER` btn
(Currently the other types of pkg are registered in online registry less than 10. That's why I request to change online registry URI in step 1)
5. Check the pagination works well or not

### What is this PR for?
To address this feedback https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2100#issuecomment-286780437, I added more test cases to ensure `RunOnSelectionChange` works well.

The newly added test cases are like below. When we run this paragraph, one dropdown menu will be shown:
```
%md
My selection is ${my selection=1,1|2|3}
```

1. When `RunOnSelectionChange` is **true** (default)
if we select ""2"" in the dropdown menu, the result text will be updated to ""My selection is 2"" right after the selection change. [See here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-2287/addTestForRunOnSelectionChange?expand=1#diff-48409cf8ca5ddb1aea1a62ada3cd091dR282)

2. When `RunOnSelectionChange` is **false**
If we select ""1"" in the dropdown menu, the result text won't be updated to ""My selection is 1"" right after the selection change instead it'll be remained as ""My selection is 2"". [See here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-2287/addTestForRunOnSelectionChange?expand=1#diff-48409cf8ca5ddb1aea1a62ada3cd091dR295)
But we can run the paragraph by pressing `Enter`. After running the paragraph manually using `Enter`, then the result text will be updated to ""My selection is 1"" [See here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-2287/addTestForRunOnSelectionChange?expand=1#diff-48409cf8ca5ddb1aea1a62ada3cd091dR301)

2. You can then run the tests with following command:

`TEST_SELENIUM=""true"" mvn package -DfailIfNoTests=false -pl 'zeppelin-interpreter,zeppelin-zengine,zeppelin-server' -Dtest=ParagraphActionsIT

Change-Id: Iad87ebe0b5dd6bd67a12e47fe83fbd0e1e71bda9

### What is this PR for?

ZEPPELIN-173 implemented an optional check for the Origin header during the websocket connection creation. This check is no longer active since jetty is upgraded to 9 as the checkOrigin method is no longer called automatically.

This fix, just calls the existing check from the WebsocketCreator manually.

### How should this be tested?

1. Set `zeppelin.server.allowed.origins` in zeppelin-site.xml other than the default `*`. Eg. `xxxx`
2. Start zeppelin
3. Try to open the zeppelin ws conection with different origin:

```
curl 'http://localhost:8080/ws' -H 'Host: localhost:8080' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0' -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13' -H 'origin: http://other:8080' -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate' -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Key: BpiqAMwZaQUJQ//NtEaQPw==' -H 'Connection: keep-alive, Upgrade' -H 'Pragma: no-cache' -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -H 'Upgrade: websocket'

When deploying Zeppelin in private Cloud or within closed networks, it happens that Maven Central isn't directly reachable, so we want to configure our own proxy and do not have to wait for minutes long timeouts when importing external libraries.

### What is this PR for?
Zeppelin's JDBC interpreter sometimes doesn't show detailed error message on the notebook ui. It shows only plain ""ERROR"" text near run button in case of failure. User has to check JDBC interpreter log file in order to see a detailed error message.

This is mostly in case of incompatible JAR and I see errors mentioned below;
```
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.curator.utils.ZKPaths.fixForNamespace(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Z)Ljava/lang/String;
	at org.apache.curator.framework.imps.NamespaceImpl.fixForNamespace(NamespaceImpl.java:82)

- result.html will draw chart every time since we use `ng-if` instead of `ng-show`
- that means DOM is deleted, and created too

### What is this PR for?

* Make Helium pkgs sortable
For now, we have 3 types of Helium packages: `VISUALIZATION`, `SPELL` and `APPLICATION`.
`VISUALIZATION` and `SPELL` type of pkgs can be published [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Likewise, `APPLICATION` type pkg can be registered in [Maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/).
But all available Helium packages are not sorted and shown in random order in Helium menu.
To do this, I put ""NPM Packages"" & ""Maven Artifacts"" button at top-right corner of Helium menu.

* Introduce ""INTERPRETER"" type
As a first step of [ZEPPELIN-1993: Install interpreter from Helium menu](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1993), I added `INTERPRETER` type as a new Helium pkg type. Like [ZEPPELIN-1973](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1973) did, we can retrieve Maven artifact(which has `zeppelin-interpreter` as its dependency) info and save it to Helium online registry as well.
For more detailed explanation, please see [ZEPPELIN-1993](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1993) and [ZEPPELIN-2110](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2110)'s description.

### What is the Jira issue?

* [ZEPPELIN-2110](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2110) : List community & 3rd party interpreter registered at Maven central repo in Helium menu

### How should this be tested?
To see how `INTERPRETER` type can be shown in Helium menu,

1. Replace temporarily [ZeppelinConfiguration.java#L46](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/conf/ZeppelinConfiguration.java#L46) with [this url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhyoungRyu/spark-notebook-example/master/helium-test.json)

2. Build \w below command and restart
```
 $ mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl 'zeppelin-zengine, zeppelin-server, zeppelin-interpreter'
```

3. Start web dev server under `ZEPPELIN_HOME/zeppelin-web` and browse `localhost:9000`
```
$ yarn run dev:helium
```

4. Go to Helium menu

### What is this PR for?
pom variables such as `${scala.version}` are not replaced to value when you do `mvn install`.
This makes leaf poms to look for this value in parent pom, which is always `2.10.5` for `${scala.version}` and it causes scala library dependency conflict. For example, zeppelin-flink_2.11 will have scala 2.10.5 as dependency.

It can be resolved in each contributors' travis account by deleting all cache in their repository like [this](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2042#issuecomment-284324008), but current Zeppelin master is under Apache travis account. So we need to clear the cache by removing `zeppelin-web/bower_components` in caching list in `.travis.yml`.

Let's see the master branch's CI turns to green light :)

### What is this PR for?

When contributor uses zeppelin fork under organization, Jenkins can't check it with current travis_check.py.

This PR updates travis_check.py to distinguish error 1 when it fails with build fail, error 2 when it can't find build.

When it fails with 2, jenkins configuration can retry travis_check.py with organization repo.

Even though it tried again, still get 2 in return, then print instruction how to configure travis-ci.

First set with
`String npmCommand = ""install —loglevel=error”;`
and You don’t connect any ethernet or wireless internet.

and set with
`String npmCommand = ""install —fetch-retries=2 —fetch-retry-factor=1 —fetch-retry-mintimeout=5000 —loglevel=error”;`
also don’t connect any networks, build & run.

WHY
retries = 2
factor = 1
mintimeout = 5(sec)?

npm use [retry](https://github.com/tim-kos/node-retry) module to retry.
It refers [this article](http://dthain.blogspot.kr/2009/02/exponential-backoff-in-distributed.html) for retry algorithms.
It is a math which structured _Math.min(Math.round(random * minTimeout * Math.pow(factor, attempt)), maxTimeout)_.
In retry source code, between two retries. First retry doesn't care _Math.min()_, just _Math.round(random * minTimeout * Math.pow(factor, attempt))_)

Description | Before | After
------- | ------- | -------
Condition | npm's default setting<br>random = False = 1<br>retry = 2<br>minTimeout = 10 (sec)<br>maxTimeout = 60 (sec)<br>factor = 10 | custom setting<br>random = False = 1<br>retry = 2<br>minTimeout = 5 (sec)<br>maxTimeout = 60 (sec)<br>factor = 1<br>
First retry | Math.round(1 * 10 (sec) * 10^1)) | Math.round(1 * 5 (sec) * 1^1))
First retry result (Approximately) | 100 (sec) | 5 (sec)
Second retry | Math.min(Math.round(1 * 10 (sec) * 10^2), 60 (sec)) | Math.min(Math.round(1 * 5 (sec) * 1^2), 60 (sec))
Second retry result (Approximately) | 60 (sec) | 5 (sec)
Total waiting time (Approximately) | 160 (sec) | 10 (sec)

### What is this PR for?
* bump nvd3 to 1.8.5 (and remove depecrated functions)
* display percentage in pie chart [solve ZEPPELIN-1891]

NB: visualization-scatterchart.js's tooltip content generator has been updated to stop using depecrated tooltip property and use tooltip.contentGenerator instead. However I have commented the code as I think nvd3 scatterchart's default tooltip is far more elegant, open to discussion.

### What is this PR for?
A common use case in LDAP/AD setup is the hierarchical structuring of
groups - a.k.a. adding groups to other groups. Such nesting groups can
help reduce the number of roles that need to be managed.

Current zeppelin realm implementations doesn't have support for looking
up memberships throughout nested group structures.

E.g. consider the following nested group scenario:
```
acme_employees
 \__department_a
     \__sub_department_x
```
User 'bob' is in Group 'sub_department_x'.
Notebook 'note1' has a Reader Role assignment for 'department_a' or
'acme_employees'.
Then access must be granted for 'bob' on 'note1'.

In AD enviroments this scenarios can be efficiently implemented using
the so called LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN operator
'1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941'.

This PR introduces a property 'groupSearchEnableMatchingRuleInChain' to
org.apache.zeppelin.realm.LdapRealm which defaults to false. If enabled,
all roles of potential nested group hierarchies will be resolved using
the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN operator.

### What type of PR is it?

### How should this be tested?

### What is the Jira issue?
* [ZEPPELIN-2167](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2167)

### How should this be tested?
Steps to reproduce:
 - Create a notebook ""test_nb"" as bob.
 - Delete the notebook
 - Login as mary and try restoring ""test_nb"" from Trash folder. The system correctly complains of insufficient privileges.
 - Open the ""test_nb"" notebook from Trash folder. The notebook opens with title ""~Trash/test_nb"".
 - Edit the title and remove the prefix ""~Trash"".

If you now look at the list of notebooks there is no file ""test_nb"" in Trash.
Interestingly when you try and delete the recently moved file from Trash it complains that mary does not have privileges to delete it. Edit the title of that notebook to ""~Trash/test_nb"" and it goes back to Trash folder.

It would be better to use `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON`  which is what spark use officially.

### What is this PR for?

Supporting helium package configurations. I attached screenshots.

#### Implementation details.

In case of spell, spell developer can create config spec in their `package.json` and it will be part of `helium.json` which is consumed by Zeppelin.

```
  ""config"": {
    ""repeat"": {
      ""type"": ""number"",
      ""description"": ""How many times to repeat"",
      ""defaultValue"": 1
    }
  },
```

1. Persists conf per `package namepackage version` since each version can require different configs even if they are the same package.
2. Saves key-value config only. Since config spec (e.g `type`, `desc`, `defaultValue`) can be provided. So it's not efficient save both of them.
3. Extracts config related functions to `helium.service.js` since it can be used not only in `helium.controller.js` for view but also should be used in `paragraph.controller.js`, `result.controller.js` for executing spell.

### What type of PR is it?
[Feature]

### Todos
* [x] - create config view in `/helium`
* [x] - persist config per `packageversion`
* [x] - pass config to spell

### What is the Jira issue?

[ZEPPELIN-2069](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2069)

### How should this be tested?

- Build with examples `mvn clean package -Phelium-dev -Pexamples -DskipTests;`
- Open `/helium` page
- Update the `echo-spell` config
- Execute the spell like the screenshot below. (you don't need to refresh the page, since executing spell will fetch config from server)

### What is this PR for?
Adding endpoint in NotebookRepoRestApi to trigger reload and broadcast of the note list.
Sending a GET request to /api/notebook-repositories/reload will trigger a reload of the note list, just like the reload button does on the homepage.
Q: If you think this endpoint belongs to another API (NotebookRestApi?), let me know.

### What is this PR for?
Every `Helium.getAllPackageInfo()` call read helium package information from all registry configured (both local registry, online registry by default).
Problem is, `Helium.getAllPackageInfo()` is used inside of many other methods. like `Helium.suggestApp()`, `Helium.enable()`, `Helium.disable()`, `Helium.recreateBundle()`, `Helium.getPackageInfo()`.
So local/remote registry is unnecessarily accessed more than it should do.

tae-jun,2017-02-12 11:21:59,https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/git/commits/5e75145ac84bf6fb844b90f3a466bca89a6fde9a,5e75145ac84bf6fb844b90f3a466bca89a6fde9a,"[ZEPPELIN-1859] Add MongoNotebookRepo

### What is this PR for?
This PR adds Mongo notebook storage.

The reason that I made this feature is for HA(High Availability).
S3 and Git storage are the only available method for HA as far as I know.

I'm managing Ambari cluster in my lab, but Zeppelin is the most vulnerable part of it.
Because one server contains all Zeppelin notes.

Therefore, by deploying MongoDB's [replica set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/) and using it as Zeppelin notebook storage, I would like to achieve HA.

#### The way to use Mongo DB as notebook storage
```sh
export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_STORAGE=org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.MongoNotebookRepo
```

or at `zeppelin-site.xml`:
```xml
<property>
  <name>zeppelin.notebook.storage</name>
  <value>org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.MongoNotebookRepo</value>
  <description>notebook persistence layer implementation</description>
</property>
```
#### Configurable environment variables
* `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_URI` MongoDB connection URI
* `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_DATABASE` Database name
* `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_COLLECTION` Collection name
* `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_AUTOIMPORT` If `true`, automatically import your local notes. Default `false`

They can be configured at `zeppelin-site.xml` as well:
* `zeppelin.notebook.mongo.uri`
* `zeppelin.notebook.mongo.database`
* `zeppelin.notebook.mongo.collection`
* `zeppelin.notebook.mongo.autoimport`

#### Future work
If we use Mongo DB's [oplog tailing](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-oplog/), maybe multi-server architecture is possible.

### What type of PR is it?
[Feature]

### Todos
* [ ] - Write a documentation for Mongo storage

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1859

### How should this be tested?
#### Install MongoDB (if you don't have)
```sh
brew update
brew install mongodb
```
#### Build Zepppelin
```sh
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```
#### Run Zeppelin wih Mongo storage
```sh
export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_STORAGE=org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.MongoNotebookRepo
export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_AUTOIMPORT=true
bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart
```
The default database and collection names are `zeppelin`, `notes` respectively.
And `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_AUTOIMPORT` option will automatically import your `local notes` that don't exist in MongoDB.
#### Check whether a document in MongoDB updated
Create, update, remove a note and open mongo shell:
```sh
mongo zeppelin
```
And check state of the note is the same as you think:
```sh
db.notes.findOne({_id: '<NOTE_ID_THAT_YOU_WANT_TO_SEE>'})
```
#### Confirm that configurations works
```sh
export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_STORAGE=org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.MongoNotebookRepo
export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_AUTOIMPORT=true
export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_DATABASE=otherdb
export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_COLLECTION=mynotes
export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart
```
The collection `mynotes` should be created in db `otherdb`.
Let's check it!
```sh
mongo otherdb
db.mynotes.count()
```
The result should not be zero.

#### Confirm that configurations from `zeppelin-site.xml` works
Open your `conf/zeppelin-site.xml` file (copy from `zeppelin-site.xml.template` if you don't have one), and comment lines below:
```xml
<!--
<property>
  <name>zeppelin.notebook.storage</name>
  <value>org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.VFSNotebookRepo</value>
  <description>notebook persistence layer implementation</description>
</property>
-->
```
And add lines below:
```xml
<property>
  <name>zeppelin.notebook.storage</name>
  <value>org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.MongoNotebookRepo</value>
  <description>notebook persistence layer implementation</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>zeppelin.notebook.mongo.uri</name>
  <value>mongodb://localhost</value>
  <description>MongoDB connection URI used to connect to a MongoDB database server</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>zeppelin.notebook.mongo.database</name>
  <value>zepl</value>
  <description>database name for notebook storage</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>zeppelin.notebook.mongo.collection</name>
  <value>notes</value>
  <description>collection name for notebook storage</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>zeppelin.notebook.mongo.autoimport</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>import local notes into MongoDB automatically on startup</description>
</property>
```

This time we will import a note via `mongoimport`. I made it possible to import a note from JSON just in case.
```sh
cd $ZEPPELIN_HOME/notebook/<NOTE_ID_YOU_WANT_TO_IMPORT>
mongoimport --db zepl --collection notes --file note.json
```

Ensure that your environment variables are clean(just reopen your terminal if you are not), and restart zeppelin:
```sh
bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart
```
Open browser and go to `localhost:8080`. The note that you imported should be shown.

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? Maybe...? I used [java-mongodb-driver](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongo-java-driver/3.4.1) which has *The Apache Software License, Version 2.0*
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? NO
* Does this needs documentation? YES

### What is this PR for?
Reducing size of InterpreterFactory and divide some functions from InterpreterFactory. Currently, InterpreterFactory has a lot of functions including management on InterpreterSetting and interpreter processes. This PR extracts InterpreterSetting-related parts into `InterpreterSettingManager`. It also has two unrelated functions: InterpreterSetting and InterpreterGroup. I'll treat it with another PR. This PR has some mechanical changes because it can help understand which parts has been changed. I'll do refactoring them later.

### What is this PR for?
Currently there is no link to go back to [zeppelin.apache.org](https://zeppelin.apache.org) in each docs site. It's a bit inconvenient.

e.g. In [https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.8.0-SNAPSHOT/](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.8.0-SNAPSHOT/), if I click Zeppelin main logo, it keeps me staying in docs main page not the root: [zeppelin.apache.org](https://zeppelin.apache.org).

So I separated main logo in navbar to ""Zeppelin"" and ""version"". And linked [production_url](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/_config.yml#L34) and [BASE_PATH](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/_config.yml#L62) to each of them.

### What is this PR for?
Hadoop Client will re-login once the ticket expired in case of RPC and so when hive.server2.transport.mode is binary, Hive Jdbc interpreter does a relogin and works fine. But when Rest API is used i.e when hive.server2.transport.mode is http, it is not doing a re-login and so fails with GSS exception.

### What is this PR for?
PySparkInterpreter (and PySparkInterpreterMatplotlibTest, SparkInterpreterTest, SparkSqlInterpreterTest) test does not terminate SparkInterpreter after test end.

In the beginning, keeping SparkInterpreter alive was designed to prevent create/destroy SparkInterpreter multiple times in various tests, because it takes some time.

However, that is somehow misbehaving and getting problems like

1. starting another SparkInterpreter before one SparkInterpreter terminates
2. Does not finish PySparkInterpreter process explicitly cause py4j client somehow creates a lot of connection attempt, that consumes all capacity of systems port open, and make next SparkInterpreter start fail.

This PR terminates SparkInterpreter after test class finishes, to prevent above behavior.

### What is this PR for?
As we won't support `zeppelin.interpreters` property anymore (from `0.7.0`), the related msg should be removed accordingly. So I removed it from [docs/manual/interpreterinstallation.md#install-3rd-party-interpreters](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/manual/interpreterinstallation.md#install-3rd-party-interpreters) & [InstallInterpreter.java#L291](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/install/InstallInterpreter.java#L291). And rewrite some guide msg like below.

1. After successful installation
 - Before
```
Interpreter spark installed under /Users/ahyoungryu/Dev/zeppelin-bin/zeppelin-0.7.0-bin-netinst/interpreter/spark.

Add interpreter class name to 'zeppelin.interpreters' property in your conf/zeppelin-site.xml file
Create interpreter setting in 'Interpreter' menu on GUI. And then you can bind interpreter on your notebook
```

 - After
```
Interpreter spark installed under /Users/ahyoungryu/Dev/zeppelin-development/zeppelin/interpreter/spark.

1. Restart Zeppelin
2. Create interpreter setting in 'Interpreter' menu on Zeppelin GUI
3. Then you can bind the interpreter on your note
```

2. If it's skipped (since the interpreter dir already existed)
 - Before
```
Directory /Users/ahyoungryu/Dev/zeppelin-bin/zeppelin-0.7.0-bin-netinst/interpreter/flink already exists. Skipping

Create interpreter setting in 'Interpreter' menu on GUI. And then you can bind interpreter on your notebook

```

### What type of PR is it?
just removed unnecessary message :)

### What is the Jira issue?

### How should this be tested?
1. Apply this patch and build with
```

```

2. Remove `interpreter/spark`
```
$ rm -r interpreter/spark
```

3. Install Spark using `install-interpreter.sh`
```
$ ./bin/install-interpreter.sh --name spark --artifact org.apache.zeppelin:zeppelin-spark_2.10:0.7.0

### What is this PR for?
Sometimes I need to point some Zeppelin configuration property to let sbd know. But as Zeppelin conf table has too many properties now(about 35), it's hard to find where the property that I'm finding located.

So I made each Zeppelin conf property accessible by adding anchor icon next to it. And added

…on + sqlcompleter tests

### What is this PR for?
This PR changes autocompletion behaviour in jdbc interpeter.
There are some changes:
* [main change] autocompletion now depends on what are you typing. Now there are four types of competion: schema, table, column and keywords. If you typing new word then autocompetion suggests only keywords and schema names. If you are typing after schema name with point then you get list of tables in that schema. Also if you typing a name after point after a table name you will get a list of column names of this table.
* autocomption now supports aliases in sql. If you write alias for a table in sql you will get a list of columns for an aliased table if you write down alias and point.
* autocompletion now load keywords only in low case (otherwise there are so many keywords in a list of autocompletion that it is becomes uncomfortable)

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### Todos
* [ ] - sort names in the output of autocompletion
* [ ] - list only schema names if we are typing a schema name (for example after keywork FROM)
* [ ] - add description in autocompletion list for schema names - schema, for table names - table and so
* [ ] - autocompletion must initialize on opening of interpeter (not only after execution of sql)
* [ ] - update autocompletion schemas only after execute update sql, not after every sql ???
* [ ] - new option for postgresql interpreter: postgresql.completer.schema.filter. Filter schema names loaded into autocompletion (no more garbage schema names).

### What is the Jira issue?
* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/
* Put link here, and add [ZEPPELIN-*Jira number*] in PR title, eg. [ZEPPELIN-533]

#1879 check if `$scope.editor` is null on `focusParagraph` message, and if it is, just return without handling focus/blur.
Instead of doing null check in the beginning of `$scope.on(focusParagraph)`, I made null check to be scoped only to `$scope.editor`'s method invocation.
FYI, when I say focus/blur, it means paragraph focus. Focused paragraph has different css style from blurred paragraph.

 - if first paragraph is blurred, when you click second paragraph.
 - if first paragraph is not run when you run second paragraph with shift + enter. In current master, first editor is not blurred even if you click second paragraph, which makes both first and second paragraph to be focused. This will make both paragraphs to be run.
 - if it is focused when you click third paragraph whose editor is hidden. In current master, it won't work.

### What is this PR for?

Implemented **Spell** as one of Helium categories. *Technically, it's the frontend interpreter* runs on browser not backend.

Spell can provide many benefits.

1. Anyone can install, remove easily using helium package registry by #1936
2. Implementing spell is extremely easier rather than adding backend interpreter
3. Can use existing javsacript libraries. (e.g [flowchart.js](http://flowchart.js.org/), [sequence diagram js](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams), ...). This enable us to add many visualization tools. Imagine that you can implement some custom interpreters with few lines of code like [flowchart-spell-example](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...1ambda:ZEPPELIN-2008/introduce-spell?expand=1#diff-364845b20d68e4d94688e44fef03da98)
4. The most important thing is, spell is not only interpreter but also display system. Because it runs on browser. So we can use spell display system with another spell **Display System with Spell** (see the screenshot section below)

 **In future**, we will be able to combine existing backend interpreters with spell like (**not supported in this PR cause we need to modify backend code a lot**)

```
// if we have markdown spell, we can use `%markdown` display in the spark interpreter

%spark

val calculated = doSomething()
println(s""%markdown _${calculated})
```

I added some examples. Checkout `echo`, `markdown`, `translator`, `flowchart` spells.

### What type of PR is it?
[Feature]

### Todos
* [x] - Add `SPELL` as one of Helium categories.
* [x] - Implement framework code (`zeppelin-spell`)
* [x] - Make some examples (flowchart, google translator, markdown, echo)
* [x] - Support custom display system
* [x] - Fix some bugs in `HeliumBundleFactory`
* [x] - Save spell rendering result into `note.json` while broadcasting to other websocket clients
* [x] - Fix `renderText` for stream output

### What is the Jira issue?

[ZEPPELIN-2008](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2008)

### How should this be tested?

- Build `mvn clean package -Phelium-dev -Pexamples -DskipTests;`
- Go to helium page `http://localhost:8080/#/helium`
- Enable all spells
- Go to a notebook and refresh
- Follow actions in the screenshots below.

### What is this PR for?
Customizing the Zeppelin Homepage to show the notebook list does not work as [0.6.2 document](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.2/manuala/notebookashomepage.html#show-notebooks-list-in-your-custom-homepage). Furthermore, it is not working on 0.7.0 version ([0.7.0 document](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/manual/notebookashomepage.html#show-notes-list-in-your-custom-homepage)).

That reason is that get_home message of zeppelin websocket is called in zeppelin-web twice.

At this chance, I suggest to split role to HomeCtrl and CustomHomeCtrl because when ""Home.controller.js"" is update, It could be conflicted like current issue.
So I think it would be more convenient to manage the roles separately.

This is how a sample `jdbc:hive2://<host1>:<port1>,<host2>:<port2>/dbName;initFile=<file>;sess_var_list?hive_conf_list#hive_var_list` looks like. And when ""hive_conf_list"" is set then, User Impersonation which is passed via ""sess_var_list"" fails.

### What is this PR for?
This PR provides a way to invoke method remotely against the resource in the resource pool.
This will be particularly useful when the object in the resource pool is non-serializable (like jdbc connection, spark dataframe).

This PR extends data access API of Resource from

```
class Resource {
  // get object
  public Object get();
}
```

to
```
class Resource {
  // get object
  public Object get()

  // call method of object and get return value
  public Object invokeMethod(String methodName, Class [] paramTypes, Object [] params);

  // call method of object and save return value into resourcepool
  public Resource invokeMethod(String methodName, Class [] paramTypes, Object [] params, String returnResourceName);

`RemoteSchedulerTest.test` was fall when CPU switched `RemoteScheduler` execution (which executes a job in a separate thread) back to test main thread execution after changing job status to `Status.FINISHED` but before updating running jobs list:
```
job.setStatus(lastStatus);

// if thread execution is switched here to the main thread test will fall

synchronized (queue) {
    running.remove(job);
    queue.notify();
}
```
Test checked job status, saw that job was terminated and expected to see an empty jobs runing list.
```
while (!job.isTerminated() && cycles < MAX_WAIT_CYCLES) {
    Thread.sleep(TICK_WAIT);
    cycles++;
}

// this assert will fail because a job was not removed from running list yet
assertEquals(0, scheduler.getJobsRunning().size());
```
But `scheduler.running` list still contained the last job and the assertion failed.

The goal is to synchronize updating of a job status and a scheduler running jobs list when a job is terminated.

### What is the Jira issue?

### How should this be tested?
You may place a `Thread.sleep(1000);` code to the `RemoteScheduler.java` class after the `job.setStatus(lastStatus);` (line number 354). This will increase probability of threads switching after this line. Test should not fail.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1984

So `return 1` outside of function is not correct and gets ignored by shell interpreters, also it causes
Zeppelin to not catch situations when interpreter hasn't started, as shown in ZEPPELIN-1984.
As you can see Zeppelin got exit status of interpreter.sh as 0 when it had to be 1 (error). Zeppelin then starts a loop to try to connect interpreter process, and fails half a minute later with `connection refused`

### How should this be tested?
On example of Spark interpreter, remove keytab file and keep --keytab reference to it in SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS. Try to use Spark interpreter. spark-submit will fail with `Exception in thread ""main"" org.apache.spark.SparkException: Keytab file: /home/someuser/.kt does not exist` but Zeppelin (around [RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess.java](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/remote/RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess.java#L121) ) wouldn't capture this problem (or many other problems starting interpreter process [as indicated here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1984?focusedCommentId=15831000&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15831000) )

This fix for ZEPPELIN-1984 would allow for error to be captured by RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess.java.

A future improvement could be made, to carry forward exception from interpreter to RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess.java so end user could clearly see what's the problem, not just that the interpreter could not be started.

The issue is that spark 2.1 use `commons-lang3` 3.5 while `zeppelin-interpreter` use 3.4. We can not just upgrade `commons-lang3` to 3.5, as it just make spark 2.1 work, but would fail other versions of spark. This PR remove `commons-lang3` from zeppelin-interpreter.

DepInterpreterTest will use random temporary folder for repo

`DefaultRepositorySystem.resolveDependencies` throws NPE at line 352
if `ArtifactResolutionException` is thrown during `collectDependencies`.
Artifact is found but it is impossible to download it (for example folder
can't be created)

I think the reason is that several tests use ""local-repo"" folder for repository.
While one test tries to download artifact, another deletes repository
(or some another distructive thing)

### What is this PR for?
Current helium plugin application api (experimental) requires create library in java class, and need to create both backend / frontend code in the package. Which is good if your plugin requires both frontend and backend code running.

However, when user just want to make new visualization which completely runs on front-end side in javascript, creating helium application in java project and taking care of backend code can be bit of overhead and barrier for javascript developers.

This PR adds capability to load pure javascript package as a visualization.

### how it works

1. create (copy, download) 'helium package json' file into `ZEPPELIN_HOME/helium` directory.
  The json file point visualization js package in npm repository or local file system in `artifact` field.
  `type` field in the json file need to be `VISUALIZATION`

Here's an example (zeppelin-examples/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar.json)
```
{
  ""type"" : ""VISUALIZATION"",
  ""name"" : ""zeppelin_horizontalbar"",
  ""description"" : ""Horizontal Bar chart (example)"",
  ""artifact"" : ""./zeppelin-examples/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar"",
  ""icon"" : ""<i class='fa fa-bar-chart rotate90flipX'></i>""
}
```

2. Go to helium GUI menu. (e.g. http://localhost:8080/#/helium).
  The menu will list all available packages.
<img width=""796"" alt=""writing_visualization_helium_menu"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/21749660/0f401c10-d558-11e6-9961-b6d0a9c023d8.png"">

3. click 'enable' in any package want to use.
Once a visualization package is enabled, `HeliumVisualizationFactory` will collect all enabled visualizations and create js bundle on the fly.

4. js bundle will be loaded on notebook and additional visualization becomes available
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/21749729/709b2b3e-d559-11e6-8318-7f2871e7c39a.png)

### Programming API to create new plugin visualization.

Simply extends [visualization.js](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-web/src/app/visualization/visualization.js) and overrides some methods, such as

```
  /**
   * get transformation
   */
  getTransformation() {
    // override this
  };

  /**
   * Method will be invoked when data or configuration changed
   */
  render(tableData) {
    // override this
  };

  /**
   * Refresh visualization.
   */
  refresh() {
    // override this
  };

  /**
   * method will be invoked when visualization need to be destroyed.
   * Don't need to destroy this.targetEl.
   */
  destroy() {
    // override this
  };

  /**
   * return {
   *   template : angular template string or url (url should end with .html),
   *   scope : an object to bind to template scope
   * }
   */
  getSetting() {
    // override this
  };
```

This is exactly the same api that built-in visualization uses.

an example implementation included `zeppelin-examples/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar/horizontalbar.js`.
Actually [all built-in visualizations](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/zeppelin-web/src/app/visualization/builtins) are example

### Packaging and publishing visualization

Each visualization will need `package.json` file (e.g. `zeppelin-examples/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar/package.json`) to be packaged.
Package can be published in npm repository or package can be deployed to the local filesystem.

`zeppelin-examples/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar/` is an example package that is deployed in the local filesystem

### Development mode

First, locally install and enable your development package by setting `artifact` field to the development directory.
Then run zeppelin-web in visualization development mode with following command
```
cd zeppelin-web
npm run visdev
```
When you have change in your local development package, just reload your notebook. Then Zeppelin will automatically rebuild / reload the package.

Any feedback would be appreciated!

### What type of PR is it?
Feature

### Todos
* [x] - Load plugin visualization js package on runtime
* [x] - Make the feature works in zeppelin Binary package
* [x] - Show loading indicator while 'enable' / 'disable' package
* [x] - Add document
* [x] - Add license of new dependency
* [x] - Development mode
* [x] - Propagate error to front-end
* [x] - Display multiple versions of a package.

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1619

### How should this be tested?
Build Zeppelin with `-Pexamples` flag. That'll install example visualization package `horizontalbar`.
You'll able to select `horizontalbar` along with other built-in visualizations

To test npm online package install capability,  Place [zeppelin-bubble.json](https://github.com/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin-bubble/blob/master/zeppelin-bubble.json) in hour local registry (`ZEPPELIN_HOME/helium`) and enable it in Helium gui menu.
And then zeppelin will download package from npm repository and load.

### What is the Jira issue?

[ZEPPELIN-1917](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1917)

### How should this be tested?

1. Install [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)
2. Make sure that your python interpreter can use `conda` (check the Interpreter Binding page)
3. Remove `test` conda env since we will create in the following section

```sh
$ conda env remove --yes --name test
```

4. Run these commands with `%python.conda`

```
%python.conda info
%python.conda env list
%python.conda create --name test

# you should be able to see `test` in the list
%python.conda env list
%python.conda activate pymysql
%python.conda install pymysql

# you should be able to import
%python
import pymysql.cursors

%python.conda uninstall pymysql
%python.conda deactivate pymysql

# you should be able to see `No module named pymysql.cursor` since we deactivated
%python
import pymysql.cursors
```

### What is this PR for?

I told to zjffdu, I thought the note name should be same with Spark (""Basic Feature (Spark)"") in [this comment](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1830#discussion_r95522394) (because they have same contents).

But considering the number of Spark and Pig users, the Spark tutorial note needs to be placed as first I think.

### What is this PR for?
This is to add spark impersonation using --proxy-user option. note that it enables also to use spark impersonation without having logged user as system user with configured ssh.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### Todos
* [x] - add `--proxy-user`
* [x] - try on standalone spark 1.6.2
* [x] - try on yarn-client mode spark 2.0.1

### What is the Jira issue?
Directly solves [ZEPPELIN-1730](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1730) and also solves [ZEPPELIN-1587](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1587) according to discussion in #1566 since using `--proxy-user` in `spark-submit` is preferable method.

### How should this be tested?
1. switch your spark cluster to `per user` and `isolated` mode
2. set up `user impersonation` flag
3. run some job using that spark interpreter
4. spark context should be created with currently logged in user credentials on behalf of system user

### What is this PR for?
After #1567 merged we can get/set note permission info for a certain note. But this info is not described in anywhere for now. So I added ""Security"" section under [docs/rest-api/rest-notebook.md](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/rest-api/rest-notebook.md).

And currently so many operations are placed under one section like below.

So I split them under each `Note opersions`, `Paragraph operations`, `Cron jobs`, and `Permission` section.

### What is this PR for?
After #1520 we can set default interpreter when we create new note. Currently this feature is implemented to get `interpreterSetting` list when Zeppelin is initiated (can be checked in dev console). And it needs user's info. So there can be two cases like below.

 - Shiro off
It tries to get interpreter setting lists as `anonymous` user
![shirooff](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21676394/cce513d8-d378-11e6-9645-99255882b664.png)
In this case, the problem is not happened. If we don't turn Shiro on, it doesn't need user's info and Zeppelin automatically creates fake user(?) info as `anonymous`. So there is no problem to get the interpreter setting lists.

 - Shiro on
tries to get interpreter setting lists as '  ' user since we're not loggined yet.
![shiroon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21676414/db03515a-d378-11e6-99c9-34775e07a2e8.png)
So it's failed to get interpreter setting lists since it doesn't have any user info. It needs reloading to get it.
![whenshiroon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21676657/e08ee03e-d379-11e6-8844-6baa673e0308.gif)

Actually we don't need to send `GET_INTERPRETER_SETTINGS` msg when Zeppelin started. It would be fine when we click ""Create new note"" button. So I removed `init()` (it's used only for getting interpreter settings) and made `getInterpreterSettings` called only when user clicks ""Create new note"" in both Zeppelin home and Navbar.

[ZEPPELIN-1850](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1850)

### How should this be tested?

- Run this command to compare build time in master and pr branch

`rm -rf zeppelin-web/bower_components zeppelin-web/node zeppelin-web/node_modules; mvn clean package -pl 'zeppelin-web' -DskipTests`

- If you want to compare `npm install` and `yarn install` only,

First remove this line in package.json `""postinstall"": ""bower install --silent && grunt googlefonts"",`
And then, execute `npm install` and `yarn install` respectively

Currently Zeppelin `%md` result style is using [`github-markdown-css`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css). But the plain text's font-size a bit bigger than any other interpreter's. And the margin between the text paragraph is also wider than before. So I reduced them.

### What is this PR for?

Zeppelin sparkr only shows first element of all outputs due to invalid implementation

```scala
// https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/zeppelin/spark/ZeppelinRDisplay.scala#L71

private def textDisplay(body: Element): RDisplay = {
  // we are extracting only the first element. it shouldn't
  RDisplay(body.getElementsByTag(""p"").first().html(), TEXT, SUCCESS)
}
```

#### FYI

SparkR interpreter sends message which containing multiple whitespaces, newlines. But zeppelin frontend breaks the space characters. This should be handled by other issue ([ZEPPELIN-1914](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1914)). As you can see the screenshot below, the paragraph result sent from websocket keeps consequent whitespaces and newlines until rendering.

### What is this PR for?
I think [Quick Start](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/install/install.html) page should contain minimum contents to get start Zeppelin for beginners.

### What is this PR for?

Fixed **Clear all paragraphs** button in a note (I attached a screenshot)

### Details

- `NotebookServer.java` sends the `NOTE` websocket message
- But `notebook.controller.js` doens't apply the result properly since it has invalid impl

```javascript
  $scope.$on('setNoteContent', function(event, note) {
      ....

      if ($scope.note === null) { // only set if the note is empty? what if already created?
        $scope.note = note;
      } else {
        $scope.note.config.personalizedMode = note.config.personalizedMode;
      }
```

- The reason I fixed `if (!$scope.editor || !$scope.editor.isFocused())` (in `paragraph.controll.js`) is because i am getting this type error whenever i click `Run all paragraphs` button after commit 7f95b9b (in this PR)

```javascript
angular.js:13236 TypeError: Cannot read property 'isFocused' of null
    at ChildScope.ParagraphCtrl.$scope.scrollToCursor (paragraph.controller.js:718)
    at paragraph.controller.js:708

### What is this PR for?
After #1711 merged, plain text paragraph result CSS is broken now. Originally the text result like below (it's `0.6.2`). The font was `Monaco` applied by `.paragraph .text` class.
![result1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21538417/421bdb76-cde0-11e6-901e-8fd79c0cb69a.png)

But now  bootstrap default font `Helvetica` is used.

So I bring it back by adding new class `.plainTextContainer`.

No Jira issue for this

### What is this PR for?
Currently we can download table data set as `.csv` or `.tsv` format in Zeppelin note. But since the exported file name is always set as `data.csv`, it will be difficult to distinguish the each file if user tries to export it several times. So I changed the naming rule like below.

1. if the paragraph has title e.g. `this is title`, then the exported csv file name will be
`this is title_YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss a.csv` .

2. if not, the file name will be `data_YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss a.csv` .

Please see the short discussion in [ZEPPELIN-1789](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1789) for the more details. I just made this PR by following one person's opinion who raised this issue (_Ruslan Dautkhanov_ ). So if anyone has better idea, please feel free to share :)

### What is this PR for?

Removed [strip-loader](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1850) which was added to remove `console.log` in production.
But we can achieve the same result by using uglify option. I missed it in https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1805

- `strip-loader` has a bug as you can see in below (screenshot section)
- Deleting it help us to keep the package list simple
- Also using the same configuration for uglify both in webpack and grunt will ensure that vendor package have the consistent behavior when they are managed by webpack

Also, this should be merged before https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1812 since we need to modify `yarn.lock` in #1812

### How should this be tested?

1. Add this code to any js file in master branch and execute `npm run build` to lint. You will get an error

```
        console.log('editor isn\'t loaded yet, returning..');
```

2. Test the same command and code within this branch. It will work.

This PR introduces the trash! (which is essential, I think ^^;)

I added basic operations of the trash:
#### Added operations of trash
* `Move` a folder to the trash
* `Move` a note to the trash
* `Restore` a folder
* `Restore` a note
* `Remove` a folder in the trash for good
* `Remove` a note in the trash for good
* `Empty` the trash
* `Restore all` in the trash
* `Move` a note to the trash from the notebook view
* `Remove` a note to the trash for good from the notebook view
* If there is a folder that has the same name, suffix current data rather than just merging(please see screenshot below!)

### What type of PR is it?
[Feature]

### Future work
Maybe it would be better if notebook view notices that a note is in the trash.

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-1736](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1736)

### How should this be tested?
* Build this PR
* Move some folders or notes to the trash
* Restore them
* Empty the trash
* Restore all notes in the trash
* Remove folders or notes in the trash
* Remove a folder which has the same folder name in the trash

### What is this PR for?

<br/>

**1. The purpose of this PR is introducing webpack to zeppelin-web**

- It supports super-fast javascript compilation and (hot) reload
- It helps to simplify, unify build process.
- It enables for us to use `import`, `export` features.
- It's more modern stack than grunt. This will encourage other developers to contribute (*the most import thing IMO*).

**2. This PR is designed to improve build process _gradually!!!_**

- So, Angular module loading depends on the import sequence as we did before in [index.html](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-web/src/index.html#L171). (see [index.js](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1805/files#diff-a128f4667c7e1afb6058389c20627b4e)).
- Also, CSS and HTML file is not managed by webpack including its live reloading

*These will be handled by additional PRs.*

**3. This PR is not big**

- 60+ file changes are just about removing `use strict`, importing `zeppelin.js`. (Also includes fixups for #1802 and #1803)
- So skip them while reveiw
- Please focus on the changes in `Gruntfile.js`, `package.json`, `webpack.config.js`

<br/>

### What type of PR is it?
[Improvement]

### Todos
* [x] - Setup webpack.config.js
* [x] - Resolve global variable `zeppelin` problem
* [x] - Support webpack in karma (`npm run test`)
* [x] - Annotate the result bundle using webpack ng annotate plugin
* [x] - Fix eslint violations
* [x] - Livereload for HTML, CSS

### What is the Jira issue?

[ZEPPELIN-1850](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1850)

### How should this be tested?

- `cd zeppelin-web && rm -rf node_modules bower_components node`
- `npm install`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run dev` and open `localhost:9000`: **check live-reload works regarding to html, css, js files**
- `cd .. && mvn clean package -pl 'zeppelin-web' -DskipTests &&  ./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart` and open `localhost:8080`

### What is this PR for?
Currently anonymous user can open the notebook permission page and type sth in `Owner`/ `Reader` / `Writer` and then even can save it. However, in fact, it doesn't work actually.

e.g.  An anonymous user can type `admin` / `user1` to the note permission setting fields.

It doesn't make sense. At least we should disallow the non-authenticated users(a.k.a anonymous users) by deactivating those permission related features(will handle interpreter owner setting in another PR). So what I did in this PR is
 - Block opening notebook permission setting page \w notebook rest api & add related docs link: https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/security/notebook_authorization.html

### What is this PR for?
Job class has only two sub classes. I don't think we need Job abstraction class anymore, then I'll move all function of Job into Paragraph and InterpretJob. Paragraph is used into zeppelin-server and InterpretJob is done by remoteInterpreterServer. I think what we disconnect those two different classes is better to maintain each side of codes.

'spawn UNKNOWN' error occurs on zeppelin-web build processing in windows 10.
It due to the function 'grunt.util.spawn()' which is called by the module 'grunt-goog-webfont-dl'.
So I changed this module to 'grunt-google-fonts'.

This due to the shell script difference between windows and *nix. This PR just remove the checking for ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_DIR as it would be created in JVM side if the dir is not existed. I also remove it from  zeppelin.sh for *nix as well.

### What is this PR for?
The changes in the fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1319 introduced a bug which makes setting path to keystore and truststore impossible from zeppelin-site.xml.
The reason seems to be an incorrect use of getString() here
https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1319/files#diff-69b17249ac9d265091d730130d973f4aR282
and here
https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1319/files#diff-69b17249ac9d265091d730130d973f4aR311
There should be no getString there, just ""path"" as it is.

### What type of PR is it?
Hot Fix

### Todos
* [x] - Task

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1810

### How should this be tested?
Before this fix:
In `zeppelin-site.xml`
* setting `zeppelin.ssl` to `true`
* setting `zeppelin.ssl.keystore.path` to a relative path to a keystore (technically it doens't have to exist at all)
* setting `zeppelin.ssl.truststore.path` to a relative path to a truststore Zeppelin

Now Zeppelin won't start. In the log you can read something like
```WARN [2016-12-14 13:55:45,522] ({main} AbstractLifeCycle.java[setFailed]:212) - FAILED SslContextFactory8f2098e(/home/firearrow/zeppelin/incubator-zeppelin/conf/null,/home/firearrow/zeppelin/incubator-zeppelin/conf/null): java.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/firearrow/zeppelin/incubator-zeppelin/conf/null (No such file or directory)```

With this fix the correct path is resolved

Old implementation expected localRepoPath to be relative to ZEPPELIN_HOME.
It created broken path with absolute localRepoPath
(e.g. C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\..\C:\......)

Huge amount of tests passed absolute path to newRepositorySystemSession.

Path.resolve(...) works fine if parameter is absolute path

However, even if we don't set the default interpreter(don't select any interpreters) in this dialog and just create new note, the default interpreter is automatically set as `Spark` interpreter. This can be checked in the interpreter binding page. It doesn't make sense I think.
So I removed `--select--` and set the default option in the select box with `Spark` as the interpreter binding page does.

### What is this PR for?
We should remove `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_DIR` and `ZEPPELIN_INTERPRETER_DIR` from `common.sh` otherwise the corresponding property defined in `zeppelin-site.xml` won't take effect. I also check other properties like ZEPPELIN_CONF_DIR and ZEPPELIN_WAR. Although we define them explicitly in common.sh, we didn't expose them in document `install.md` and `zeppelin-site.xml.template`, so I think these are only for internal use and it is OK to keep them in common.sh although their correponding property in zeppelin-site.xml won't take effect too.

### What is this PR for?
Note ID is displayed on action bar after pressing enter key with blank notename.
This is because the scope variable for notename is used directly as the model of input field and it doesn't revert the blank notename back to its existing name even though the notename was actually not updated to the blank value. (Temporarily lost notename from scope)
To resolve this issue, I added a variable to `ElasticInputCtrl` for the model of input field.

### What is this PR for?
IMHO `destroy` is a little functional duplicated with `close`. And it seems currently only cassandra use destroy and it just calls `close()` https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/cassandra/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/cassandra/CassandraInterpreter.java#L231.

### What is this PR for?
The matplotlib tests have stalled as a result of conda downloading version 2.0.0b1. While this was an old beta version and the issue has been fixed upstream (https://github.com/conda-forge/matplotlib-feedstock/issues/86), we still have not tested the inline backend for 2.0.0 which will be a release with a lot of major changes, hence this PR should be made anyway. I am also partially undoing one of the changes made in #1709 which suppressed the output of the dependency installation from conda. This change was very puzzling to me since dependency info isn't that verbose. I ended up determining the cause of this issue because I reverted this change and was then able to see the dependency versions in the log. I could see suppressing this being necessary for the R packages in case they aren't cached and a wall of compiler output gets printed out, but I see no real justification to mute it for python packages, especially given that they will only be installed for two short profiles.

1. Check if `interpreter` directory has created under `zeppelin-distribution/target/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/`
2. Test `md` interpreter works as expected after running below command:
```
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pbuild-distr
$ cd zeppelin-distribution/target/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
$ ./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start
```
3. Check if md intepreter process has `zeppelin-distribution/target/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/lib/interpreter/*` in it's classpath.

##### Small Details

you can get this `resolutions` field by executing `bower install --force`

```
""resolutions"": {
    ""angular"": "">=1.2.15 <1.6""
  }
```

but we are using angular 1.5.0+ the resolution will cause errors like

```
[INFO]  undefined
       ERROR: 'Error: [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: $$forceReflowProvider <- $$forceReflow <- $$animateQueue <- $animate <- $compile <- $$animateQueue
[INFO] http://errors.angularjs.org/1.4.3/$injector/unpr?p0=%24%24forceReflowProvider%20%3C-%20%24%24forceReflow%20%3C-%20%24%24animateQueue%20%3C-%20%24animate%20%3C-%20%24compile%20%3C-%20%24%24animateQueue

...

[INFO] Warning: Task ""karma:unit"" failed. Use --force to continue.
```

So we need to specify 1.5.0 as the min angular version

### What is this PR for?
ZEPPELIN-1003 made an abstraction layer for visualization and now visualizations are moved to [zeppelin-web/src/app/visualization/builtins] https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/zeppelin-web/src/app/visualization/builtins from single monolithic place `paragraph.controller.js`.

However, 'setting' of each visualizations (i.e. pivot keys, groups, values selection, column selection in scatter chart, etc) are still in paragraph.controller.js and its html template is hardcoded.

This PR lets each visualization implement their own 'setting' and provide facilities to store/load configs for it.

https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/d80a810184457b51b0d9229c663badca01199c26/zeppelin-web/src/app/visualization/builtins/visualization-linechart.js#L86  can be an simple example how each visualization can have its own setting and save configs.

### What type of PR is it?

### What is this PR for?

We people in Twitter have great demand of adding a flexible drop down menu for the columns in the tables which enables the text/numeric conversion.
This is because people want some columns to be of string type which, for example, fits to the underlying DB definition.
The use cases of the change include:
1. For now sorting on the columns is always lexicographically because Zeppelin front end treats the data as strings. It the values in the table can be convertible between string and number then we can sort the column by numeric values. I have filed another ticket for this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1372
2. Since the users know more about their data than us it would be nice if we let the users decide what is the real type of their data. It is annoying if user wants the column to be strings but the front end forcefully inserts commas in it. In some scenarios, users may also want to copy/paste the table to somewhere else. If people want to remove the commas before other actions then that will be a nightmare....

### What is the Jira issue?

1. Click on the dropdown menu would convert the text/number of that column.
2. Other functionalities esp. the sorting function should not be affected.

### What is this PR for?

**First of all, this PR doesn't affect on runtime application behaivor and existing build processes. Just abstracting variables in pom.xml**

The main goal of this PR is bringing consistency and maintainability in all pom.xml.  I referred these 2 projects.

- [apache/spark: pom.xml](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/pom.xml)
- [apache/storm: pom.xml](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/pom.xml)

Currently, all libraries and plugins have duplicated version fields since we are not using `dependencyManagement`, `pluginManagement` efficiently in pom.xml

This results in

- unmanaged plugin, library versions (someone might update only a child's library version. it happend in our pom.xml files)
- so many duplicated code blocks (bad)
- fragmented plugin, library versions (some project uses junit 4.11 while another uses 4.12)

These are some examples

```xml
// hard coded, non consistent version management

      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.thrift</groupId>
        <artifactId>libthrift</artifactId>
        <version>${libthrift.version}</version>
      </dependency>

        <artifactId>httpcore</artifactId>
        <version>4.3.3</version>

Currently a paragraph can display only a single type of result.
For example
```

This pr implements multiple results supports, so not only the last, but also all the display systems in a paragraph outputs can be displayed.

To do that, Note.json format need to be changed. from

### What is this PR for?
Take 2 of #1618 because I had some earlier problems with rebasing. Since, then I have added some new features, namely:

- Matplotlib integration tests for pyspark
- `install_external_dependencies.sh` which conditionally installs the R or python dependencies based on the specified build profile in `.travis.yml`. This saves several minutes of time for a few of the build profiles since the R dependencies are compiled from source and therefore take quite a bit of time to install.
- The extra python unit tests which require external dependencies (`matplotlib` and `pandas`) are now relegated to two separate build profiles. This is done primarily to efficiently test both Python 2 and 3.
- Some minor bugs in the python and pyspark interpreters (mostly with respect to python 3 compatibility) were caught as a result of these tests, and are also fixed in this PR.

This results in compilation failure.

### What is this PR for?

Every interpreter shares their `List<Dependency>` and `InterpreterOption` object with other interpreters in the same group since these objects are mutable and just returned from `InterpreterSettingRef` in InterpreterFactory.

I attached GIF

### What type of PR is it?
[Bug Fix]

### Todos

Nothing

### What is the Jira issue?

[ZEPPELIN-1666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1666)

### How should this be tested?

I included unit test for it in `InterpreterRestApiTest.testCreatedInterpreterDependencies`.
You can reproduce and debug this by checking out commit 3acde56 and run the unit test.

If you try to debug, you can see the length of `List<Dependency>` in `md` `InterpreterSettingRef` is increased whenever creating a new interpreter setting. But it shouldn't be.

### What is this PR for?

**First of all, this PR doesn't affect on runtime application behaivor and existing build processes. Just adding validation and styling**

The main goal of this PR is to keep consistency among multiple pom.xml files

- added xml-maven-plugin to enforce valid maven conf and xml code style (included in maven verify phase)
- while removing 2 invalid `combine.children` conf (they are invalid, useless. see commit messages)
- apply 2 space indent according to [maven style guide](https://maven.apache.org/developers/conventions/code.html)

For reviewers,

most code modification is due to 4064057 (re-indent commit), **so skipping the commit will be helpful to review this**.

### What type of PR is it?
[Improvement]

### Todos

* [x] - Add maven xml plugin
* [x] - Reindent according to maven style guide

### What is the Jira issue?

[ZEPPELIN-1695](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1695)

### How should this be tested?

CI will do that. Also you can type `mvn xml:validate` usually it takes 10+- seconds.

### What is this PR for?
When we do the following operations, the entire notebook is transmitted back to client.
1) Insert paragraph
2) Remove paragraph
3) Update paragraph
4) Paragraph status update
5) commit paragraph
When the json becomes larger(which happens when large  output is stored in the json), the time to transfer the notebook to client is directly proportional.(we can check this in chrome browser-> dev console-> select ws request-> on the right pane that opens, select frames tab and observe the length column)

And since the UI update is based on this new transmitted json, the UI seems unresponsive/laggy.
In this PR, Making the updates selective.(Not sending the complete json back to client)

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### Todos
NA

### What is the Jira issue?
ZEPPELIN-1653

### How should this be tested?

-In chrome browser-> dev console-> select ws request-> on the right pane that opens, select frames tab and observe  *NOTE* message.
We should not see the message for the above mentioned operations except when the notebook is loaded is for first time
-    We should not see *GET_NOTE* log message for above operations.

### Screenshots

actually, we reduced even more because we cached apt and R :)

#### Long Motivations

Sometimes build fails due to log size for example,

```
Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.001 sec - in org.apache.zeppelin.ticket.TicketContainerTest
Running org.apache.zeppelin.security.SecurityUtilsTest

The log length has exceeded the limit of 4 MB (this usually means that the test suite is raising the same exception over and over).

The job has been terminated
```

we can prevent this kind of failure by removing useless maven log such as

### What is this PR for?
In multi-user environment when users create a notebook normally they would expect that notebook be listed only in their list/workbench. Currently Zeppelin creates/imports notes as public by default. There should be at least a way to pass through configuration to make this behaviour private be default. Should discuss whether it's public or private by default.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

1. set `zeppelin.notebook.public` property as false in `zeppelin-site.xml`
2. login as user1 and create noteA, note should appear in your list of notes

### What is this PR for?
Currently when you're trying to search some interpreters, for example ""Spark"", the page shows both ""Livy"" and ""Spark"". It's because Livy contains Spark related properties such as `livy.spark.driver.cores`, `livy.spark.driver.memory` and etc etc. As an user aspect, I felt a bit uncomfortable with this.
So I added one more condition so that it can search only based on interpreter name.

Let me add some comments already included in the commit for description.

- Use common font-style which is widely used in zeppelin
- Modify inlined font css while removing some useless properties which have default value

### What is this PR for?

Recently, zeppelin added some amazing features.
https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1613
You can easily access spark ui from the zeppelin web.
However, in the implementation of the function, the Thrift interface seems to have arbitrarily modified the automatically generated code.
So if you recreate the Thift interface by calling genthrift.sh.
Zeppelin is not built.
I modified this to get the same result with auto-generated code.

### What type of PR is it?
Bug Fix

### Todos
- [x] add event META_INFOS in RemoteInterpreterService.thrift
- [x] import generate code

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1679

### How should this be tested?
1. First you need to install thift 0.9.2.
2. Run zeppelin-interpreter / src / main / thrift / generate_thrift.sh.
3. Build full zeppelin.
4. After build, please check the interpreter spark setting in our web ui.
5. Try using the spark ui button.

If everything is running normally, it is a success.
Problems occur in the current master 3.

### What is this PR for?

This PR is the first of two major steps needed to improve matplotlib integration in Zeppelin (ZEPPELIN-1344). The latter, which is a plotting backend with fully interactive tools enabled, will be done afterwards in a separate PR. This PR specifically for automatically displaying output from calls to matplotlib plotting functions inline with each paragraph. Thanks to the addition of post-execute hooks (ZEPPELIN-1423), there is no need to call any `show()` function to display an inline plot, just like in Jupyter.
### What type of PR is it?

Improvement
### Todos

The main code has been written and anyone who reads this is encouraged to test it, but there are a few minor todos:
- [x] - Add unit tests
- [x] - Add documentation
- [x] - Add screenshot showing iterative plotting with angular mode
### What is the Jira issue?

[ZEPPELIN-1345](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1345)
### How should this be tested?

In a pyspark or python paragraph, enter and run

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3])
```

The plot should be displayed automatically without calling any `show()` function whatsoever. A special method called `configure_mpl()` can also be used to modify the inline plotting behavior. For example,

``` python
z.configure_mpl(close=False, angular=True)
plt.plot([1, 2, 3])
```

allows for iterative updates to the plot provided you have PY4J installed for your python installation (which of course is always the case if you use pypsark). To clarify, this feature only currently works with pyspark (not python as there are no `angularBind()` and `angularUnbind()` methods yet). Doing something like:

```
plt.plot([3, 2, 1])
```

will update the plot that was generated by the previous paragraph by leveraging Zeppelin's Angular Display System. However, by setting `close=False`, matplotlib will no longer automatically close figures so it is now up to the user to explicitly close each figure instance they create. There's quite a bit more options for `z.configure_mpl()`, but I will save that discussion for the documentation.

### What is this PR for?
Especially for long running flink streaming jobs it should be possible to cancel a job by clicking the cancel button in the zeppelin ui. This pull request contains an implementation to cancel jobs when the flink interpreter is running in local mode.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### Todos
* [x] - Implement cancel method

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1632

### How should this be tested?
Execute a long running flink streaming job.
The ""senv.execute()"" method is blocking, therefore the paragraph remains in the state running. Then click cancel and the job will be canceled.

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? No
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No
* Does this needs documentation? No

### What is this PR for?
This bug was fixed for the spark interpreter in

### What is this PR for?
For livy, the default mode should be scoped per use. This PR is trying to add interpreter option to `interpreter-setting.json` to allow user to set the default mode.

### What type of PR is it?
[Improvement]

### Todos
This PR is just a short term solution. There're several followup work needs to be done.
* Refactor livy interpeter to adapt scope mode.
* Option should be interpretergroup level setting rather than interpreter level setting.
* Format of `interperter-setting.json` is not consistent with `Interpereter.json`, there's some code duplication, like `RegisteredInterpereter`,  `InterpreterInfo` and etc.
* And this PR doesn't address the issue of mode restriction, user can still change to an invalid mode manually.

### What is this PR for?
The idea behind this feature is to bring flexibility to the user to let him configure his repo via UI without restarting Apache Zeppelin.
This is flexible enough to handle most of the basic needs, but more complex case can be added in the future. I will not implement all NotebookRepo, this should be done in different PR since it will depend on special needs. I will just provide a simple example with VFS notebook repo.

***NB***: this scope of the PR doesn't include save change in the configuration file of zeppelin as well as implementation of every notebook repo, git, s3 etcetc, this will be added later if needed.

### What type of PR is it?
 * **Improvement**

### Todos
* [x] - Implement backend.
* [x] - Implement frontend.
* [x] - Implement LocalVFS directory change as exemple.

### What is the Jira issue?
 * [ZEPPELIN-1575](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1575)

### How should this be tested?
Go to notebook repo setting page, edit the notebook path and save.

### What is this PR for?
This PR fix several issues of LivyInterpeter test.
* Livy interpreter's test code is not in the right place, so it never runs.
* LivyHelperTest would fail.
* No Integration test for LivyInterpreter so any following change is not easy to be tested.

This PR would fix the above issues. Regarding the integration test, some of livy's artifact is not available in repository, so I have to copy them to livy/local-maven-repo as local repository.  And LivyInterperter's integration test require spark and livy to be installed. For now you have to download spark and livy manually. Please use spark 1.5.x and livy 0.2 which is currently supported. Download livy 0.2.0 from here [https://github.com/cloudera/livy/releases](https://github.com/cloudera/livy/releases)

And use the following command to execute the LivyIntegrationTest.
```
export SPARK_HOME=<path_to_spark>
export LIVY_HOME=<path_to_livy>
mvn clean package -pl 'livy' -Dtest=LivyIntegrationTest
```
If you hit any issues, you can check logs under `livy/target/tmp`.

### What is this PR for?

Since we launch python interpreter as a process and redirect stdin and stdout, only exception occurred (like syntax error or indentation error, etc) could give string like `...`. Thus, we don't need to determine whether syntax error happened in [`PythonProcess.sendAndGetResult`](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/3dec4d7006b8a57136f34ae330ba937d8990f2d2/python/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/python/PythonProcess.java#L86) because we have detected error in [`PythonInterpreter.pythonErrorIn`](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/3dec4d7006b8a57136f34ae330ba937d8990f2d2/python/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/python/PythonInterpreter.java#L152)

### How should this be tested?
prerequisites:
1. Any DB setup.(For my testing, i considered hive)
Steps:
1. Delete the local-repo folder under zeppelin project, if it exists
2. Go to interpreter settings page, provide hive connection details under JDBC interprepreter
3. For hive interpreter to run, it needs some dependencies to be added in interpreter settings page
    For hive below dependencies needs to added
    1. org.apache.hive:hive-jdbc:0.14.0
    2. org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-common:2.6.0
4. Once the settings for JDBC interpreter is saved, dependencies will start getting downloaded in background.
5. Run any paragraph with JDBC as interpreter, paragraph should not throw error, status of the paragraph should change to 'pending' while the dependencies are getting downloaded in background.
6. Once the downloading of dependencies is done, the paragraph which were in pending will start executing in order depending on the execution mode of the interpreter (i.e Shared, Scoped, Isolated)

### What is this PR for?
See #1439. This is a second attempt based on prior feedback, particularly from Leemoonsoo who advised that it would be better to contain all of the code inside of the Interpreter Process. Aside from this, the major changes since the previous PR are:

- The terminology ""hooks"" is used instead of ""callbacks"". Since the information being passed to the interpreter isn't actually a ""callback"", strictly speaking, the more general term ""hook"" is probably a better choice. All variable / class names were updated correspondingly.
- The registry is now keyed by class name rather than the `replName` specified by the magic on top of the paragraph. The interface provided by `ZeppelinContext` allows for a `replName` to be converted to `className` through an internal mapping.
- Two new event codes, `PRE_EXEC_DEV` and `POST_EXEC_DEV` have been added. This is primarily intended to separate use cases for the interpreter maintainers (via subclasses of `Interpreter`) and the notebook users (via the `ZeppelinContext` class), as otherwise user attempts at registering a hook would overwrite that set by the interpreter maintainer.
- Global scope for hook registration is supported for the developer use cases.

### What type of PR is it?
New Feature

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-1423](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1423)

### How should this be tested?
In a new note, add the following lines of code to a paragraph:
```python
%pyspark
z.registerHook(""post_exec"", ""print 'This code should be executed before the paragraph code!'"")
z.registerHook(""pre_exec"", ""print 'This code should be executed after the paragraph code!'"")
```

Then run any other paragraph in the note containing some other code, eg
```python
%pyspark
print ""This code should be entered into the paragraph by the user!""
```

The output should be:
```
This code should be executed before the paragraph code!
This code should be entered into the paragraph by the user!
This code should be executed after the paragraph code!
```

You should also test out the other two methods (`getCallback()` and `unregisterCallback()`) specified in `ZeppelinContext.java`.

One final caveat that should be mentioned: If there are errors in the code you specify for a pre-execute event, it will render the interpreter useless since the current implementation prepends the the code specified in `pre_exec` directly to the paragraph entered code before calling `interpret()`. The current workaround for this would be to either restart the interpreter group or call `unregisterHook()` via a different REPL within the interpreter group (eg, `z.unregisterHook(""pre_exec"", ""pyspark"")` from the spark interpreter). I would appreciate if anyone here would be willing to share any better approaches here.

### What is this PR for?
Based on #338 , I refactor most of pig interpreter. As I don't think the approach in #338 is the best approach. In #338, we use script `bin/pig` to launch pig script, it is different to control that job (hard to kill and get progress and stats info).  In this PR, I use pig api to launch pig script. Besides that I implement another interpreter type `%pig.query` to leverage the display system of zeppelin. For the details you can check `pig.md`

### What is this PR for?
Currently we can use `%jdbc(prefix)` for multi database connections(e.g. configuring both postgresql and hive in one JDBC interpreter). But after #1360 merged, Zeppelin doesn't support `%jdbc(prefix)` to `%prefix` anymore. So auto-prefix feature is not working for `%jdbc(prefix)`. The auto-prefix only works for `%prefix` now. Considering this status, it would be better we remove the JDBC connection examples in `jdbc/interpreter-setting.json` (this is come from #1096) so that users can create several JDBC interpreters instead of using multiple connections with one JDBC interpreter.  I removed the related contents in `jdbc.md` as well.

Also, the contents of [current JDBC documentation page](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/interpreter/jdbc.html) is quite confusing and unorganized. So I updated the contents with some screenshot images to guide ""How to create JDBC interpreter"", ""How to edit the interpreter properties for the connection"", ""How to use `%prefix` with the interpreter"", and so on.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement & Documentation

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-1489](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1489)

### How should this be tested?
* Removing example properties in `interpreter-setting.json`
  1. after applying this patch and build with `mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pspark-1.6 -pl 'jdbc,zeppelin-interpreter,zeppelin-web,zeppelin-server,zeppelin-zengine,zeppelin-display'`
  2. create JDBC interpreter and check whether the example settings are gone or not

* JDBC docs
  1. Build only `docs/` dir as described in [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/README.md#build-documentation)
  2. Go to `interpreter -> JDBC` and just compare this locally builded page with [the original JDBC page](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/interpreter/jdbc.html)

### What is this PR for?
When using Zeppelin behind corporate firewall, sometimes the dependencies download just fails silently. This PR has 2 objectives:

* add proxy credentials information for dependencies repo
* raise clear error message in case of dependencies download failure

There are 3 commits.

The first one add extra inputs in the form for adding new repository

![add_repo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/18017489/0b486fda-6bd2-11e6-90c7-ceda18c53575.png)

The second commit fixes some issues and display a clear and explicit error message when download of dependencies fail.

Before that, when the download fails, we can see the below behaviour

![irrelevant_double_error_message](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/18017541/3cf0de1e-6bd2-11e6-8285-af03f222e8d2.gif)

* the error message is displayed twice because the call twice the method `checkDownloadingDependencies();`. One in the success callback of:

```javascript
 $scope.updateInterpreterSetting = function(form, settingId) {
              ...
            $http.put(baseUrlSrv.getRestApiBase() + '/interpreter/setting/' + settingId, request)
              .success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
                $scope.interpreterSettings[index] = data.body;
                removeTMPSettings(index);
                thisConfirm.close();
                checkDownloadingDependencies();
                $route.reload();
              })
              .error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
             ...
    };
```

Another call is inside success callback of `getInterpreterSettings()`

```javascript
var getInterpreterSettings = function() {
      $http.get(baseUrlSrv.getRestApiBase() + '/interpreter/setting')
      .success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
        $scope.interpreterSettings = data.body;
        checkDownloadingDependencies();
      }).error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
      ....
```

The problem is that `$route.reload();` in the success callback of `updateInterpreterSetting()` will trigger `init()` then `getInterpreterSettings()` so `checkDownloadingDependencies()` is called twice.

I remove the call to `checkDownloadingDependencies()` from success callback of `updateInterpreterSetting()`

The second modification is on class `DependencyResolver`. In the screen capture above, we get a **cryptic** NullPointerException coming from `DefaultRepositorySystem`. I now catch this NPE to wrap it into a more sensible and clearer exception:

```java

  public List<ArtifactResult> getArtifactsWithDep(String dependency,
    Collection<String> excludes) throws RepositoryException {
    Artifact artifact = new DefaultArtifact(dependency);
    DependencyFilter classpathFilter = DependencyFilterUtils.classpathFilter(JavaScopes.COMPILE);
    PatternExclusionsDependencyFilter exclusionFilter =
            new PatternExclusionsDependencyFilter(excludes);

    CollectRequest collectRequest = new CollectRequest();
    collectRequest.setRoot(new Dependency(artifact, JavaScopes.COMPILE));

    synchronized (repos) {
      for (RemoteRepository repo : repos) {
        collectRequest.addRepository(repo);
      }
    }
    DependencyRequest dependencyRequest = new DependencyRequest(collectRequest,
            DependencyFilterUtils.andFilter(exclusionFilter, classpathFilter));

 //Catch NPE thrown by aether and give a proper error message
    try {
      return system.resolveDependencies(session, dependencyRequest).getArtifactResults();
    } catch (NullPointerException ex) {
      throw new RepositoryException(String.format(""Cannot fetch dependencies for %s"", dependency));
    }
  }
```

The result is much more cleaner

The last commit is just doc update

### What type of PR is it?
[Improvement]

### Todos
* [ ] - Code Review
* [ ] - Simple test with no Internet connection
* [ ] - Test within a corporate firewall env with a third-party dependency, requiring download

### What is the Jira issue?
**[ZEPPELIN-1376]**

### How should this be tested?

##### Simple test
* `git fetch origin pull/1369/head:WebProxy`
* `git checkout WebProxy`
* `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
* `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart`
* disconnect from the Internet (pull out the cable, shutdown wifi ...)
* add a random dependency to the Spark interpreter (take `info.archinnov:achilles-core:4.2.2` for example)
* validate the change, you should see an error popup on the top-right corner saying that Zeppelin cannot download the dependency

##### Corporate firewall test
* follow the steps above for simple test
* create a new repository (see how to **[here]**) and set the proxy information
* retry the steps above to ensure that the download is successful

### Screenshots (if appropriate)
See above

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? --> **NO**
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? --> **NO**
* Does this needs documentation?  --> **YES, DONE**

### What is this PR for?
If user specifies library path in interpreter dependency setting, even when the file on this path is updated, new file doesn't take effect on interpreter _restart_ but does only when user _clicks Edit -> Save._
The mechanism of dependency loading is copying all dependency libraries under `local-repo/
{interpreterId}` and add these directory to classpath of interpreter process. Zeppelin copies these dependencies either on Zeppelin startup or dependency saving/editing.

This PR checks if the library on specified local path is updated, and copy them to `local-repo/
{interpreterId}` on restart if there is change.

### What is this PR for?
The issue is that we create 2 SparkSession in zeppelin_pyspark.py (Because we create SQLContext first which will create SparkSession underlying). This cause 2 instances of SparkSession in JVM side and this means we have 2 instances of Catalog as well. So udf registered in SQLContext can not be used in SparkSession. This PR will create SparkSession first and then assign its internal SQLContext to sqlContext in pyspark.

### What is this PR for?
A few sentences describing the overall goals of the pull request's commits.
First time? Check out the contributing guide - https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

This is a rewrite of the ""Quick Start"" page, fixing syntax/grammar issues while trying to keep to the original content. I may look at other pages, but I wanted my first PR to be very small.

### What type of PR is it?
Documentation

### Todos
Verify the accuracy of the configuration settings section

### What is the Jira issue?
(Does this apply to documentation PRs?)

### How should this be tested?
Do documentation changes like this need to be tested?
If so, is the github preview sufficient for these changes? How is Zeppelin's markdown interpreter different than Github's?
If Github's MD preview isn't sufficient, is it possible to build the documentation locally?

### Screenshots (if appropriate)

### Questions:
* Since this is my first PR on the project, I limited the scope of my changes. Is there any desire to  change the content of these pages in any way? Do we have documentation conventions?

### Further possible improvements
There are still several cases that Zeppelin doesn't handle syntax highlight well. These can be handled with another jira ticket/PR.
1. When default bound interpreter changes, syntax highlight is not changed accordingly
2. When copy/paste code, syntax highlight won't be applied properly since Zeppelin only checks changes when cursor is in first line.

### What is this PR for?
""Currently there are no properties and dependencies set for this interpreter"" message is shown when there are no properties & dependencies in interpreter setting page. But this message can be seen even in the edit mode. It's quite wired. This message needs to be shown only in non-editable mode.

The `edit`, `restart` and `remove` button are same.
 - `edit` button doesn't do any work after changing to edit mode
 - `restart` button: it doesn't make sense that someone is editing and restarting interpreter at the same time
 - `remove` button: Maybe someone wants to remove the interpreter while he is editing the interpreter. But it would be better this button is shown only in non-editable mode for the consistency with the other buttons.

For the above reasons, I changed those buttons to be shown in non-editable mode only. `Save` & `Cancel` buttons are enough to the edit page I think. Please see the attached gif image.

### What type of PR is it?
Bug Fix

### What is the Jira issue?

### How should this be tested?
1. After applying this patch and build only `zeppelin-web` with `./grunt build` under `zeppelin-web`.
2. You can quickly check this change in dev mode with `./grunt serve`.
3. Go to `Interpreter` menu and click ""edit"" button on Angular interpreter to see ""Currently there are no properties and dependencies set for this interpreter"" message. Can also check the existence of `edit`, `restart` and `remove` buttons.

### What is this PR for?

Support table markdown syntax issued by [ZEPPELIN-1387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1387?jql=project%20%3D%20ZEPPELIN)

### What type of PR is it?
[Bug Fix | Improvement]

This PR can be categorized as bug fix and improvement since it not only resolves the above issue but also support other markdown syntaxes.

### Todos
* [ ] - Check the license issue of the [pegdown](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown) library introduced by this PR

### What is the Jira issue?

[ZEPPELIN-1387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1387?jql=project%20%3D%20ZEPPELIN)

### How should this be tested?

### Questions:

* Does the licenses files need update?
* Does coding style is appropriate?

### Additional Comments

We might solve this issue by implementing custom table plugin for markdown4j by referring [the existing work of txtmark](https://github.com/zhenchuan/txtmark/commit/178486805e78e3d572b071ca8b9f8887a066edef).
But I think it is not good idea in regard to coverage, maintainability and efficiency since markdown4j is currently not developed actively and it costs to implement all markdown plugins which is not supported by markdown4j.

The root cause is that SQLContext's signature changes in spark 2.0.
Spark 1.6
```
def __init__(self, sparkContext, sqlContext=None):
```
Spark 2.0
```
def __init__(self, sparkContext, sparkSession=None, jsqlContext=None):

So we need to create SQLContext using named parameters, otherwise it would take intp.getSQLContext() as sparkSession which cause the issue.

         * 1. Register it from path {ZEPPELIN_HOME}/interpreter/{interpreter_name}/ interpreter-setting.json
         * 2. Register it from interpreter-setting.json in classpath {ZEPPELIN_HOME}/interpreter/{interpreter_name}

### What is this PR for?
I define SPAKR_HOME in interpreter setting, but it doesn't take effect. This PR is for bring back the environment variable defined in interpreter setting.  The root cause is that we reset the env after creating RemoteInterpreter.
```
         new RemoteInterpreter(property, noteId, className, conf.getInterpreterRemoteRunnerPath(),
             interpreterPath, localRepoPath, connectTimeout, maxPoolSize,
             remoteInterpreterProcessListener, appEventListener);
    remoteInterpreter.setEnv(env);
```

### What is the Jira issue?

### How should this be tested?
Tested manually.  Create 2 spark interpreter setting, one for spark1 another is for spark2. And define SPARK_HOME for each interpreter. Then I can run both spark1 and spark2 in one zeppelin instance.

### What is this PR for?
Spark2 version of HDP 2.5 is ""2.0.0.2.5.0.0-1245"". Currently, Zeppelin parses this version to integer 2002500, which is higher than version ""2.0.0"" (i.e. 200 in integer). Therefore, Zeppelin thinks it's not supported version and fail.

I fixed some codes to consider major, minor, and patch version. Now, version parsed using only first 3 numbers (major, minor, patch) and parsed into a 5-digit integer. For example, 2.0.0 -> 20000, 1.6.2 -> 10602, 1.10.1 -> 11001. This makes HDP 2.5 compatible, and also make it more robust than before. Since maybe Spark's minor version can be a 2-digit number in the future

This is the first step in order to ensure clear text passwords are not stored in the configuration files. To start with this PR will take care of getting AD system password from the .jceks file, configured by the user specified in the shiro.ini file. Going forward the same keystore can be used to read passwords for other systems as well.

If the hadoopSecurityCredentialPath path is present and not empty in the shiro.ini, then the password is read from the keystore file and it need not be stored inside the shiro.ini file.

### What is this PR for?
Added a 2D [Esri map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) as a graph option for paragraphs. This makes it easier to visualize relations in geographical data.
Pins are plotted at points in specified longitude/latitude columns and customizable column values are shown when pins are clicked. Is this of interest?

The angular-esri-map module is used, which is released under the Apache 2.0 license, and the JavaScript API is free to use (see [https://developers.arcgis.com/terms/](https://developers.arcgis.com/terms/)).

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? __yes.__ For angular-esri-map.
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? __no__
* Does this needs documentation? __potentially.__ This feature follows the same layout as the other visualization modes, so users will likely be able to use it easily. However, screenshots of some supported visualizations modes are present in the current documentation. If this PR is merged, it may be desirable to display the map option as well. Interestingly the scatter chart is not included in screenshots in the documentation.

### What is this PR for?
If there are problems with the information defined in the Interpreter Setting (conf / interpreter.json), Interpreter Group during the defined file does not exist, can not run Zeppelin.
Thus, it was an exception handling for that part.

In order to address this issue in the current version it was restarted after deleting Interpreter.json.

### What type of PR is it?

### Todos
- [x] - check to Interpreter Setting is null

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1316

### How should this be tested?

1. Modify the following part of the Interpreter.json file.
```json
{
      ""interpreterGroup"": [
        {
          ""name"": ""spark"",
          ""class"": ""fake and invalid class path more more..."", // invalid value
          ""defaultInterpreter"": false
        }

### What is this PR for?
This PR adds support for plotting png images using the matplotlib helper function within a python interpreter (eg `z.show()`). The primary motivation for this is due to the overhead incurred from svg images, which can lag the notebooks if multiple, complicated images are generated (for example, multiple filled contour plots). png images are more lightweight, but of course come at a cost of image quality due to them being raster rather than vector like svg. The support for png images is incorporated through the use of a new optional argument to `z.show` called `fmt` which can be one of `'svg'` or `'png'`. The same code that is currently used in show is used for svg images while the code for png images relies on converting the image directly to a byte array and then entering the decoded byte string directly into an HTML image tag. Currently `fmt` defaults to `'png'` but I think we should consider discussing the pros and cons of each option in this PR.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-1318](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1318)

### How should this be tested?
In a notebook cell, enter:
```python
%python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

plt.figure()
plt.plot(np.arange(10))
z.show(plt, fmt=fmt)
```
Where `fmt` may be one of `'svg'` or `'png'`, and any other input should result in a `ValueError`. I would also recommend testing the example in the screenshot below.

### What is this PR for?
As more and more document pages are added, it's really hard to find specific pages. So I added searching feature to Zeppelin documentation site([jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based site) using [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com/).

 - **How does it work?**

  I created [`search_data.json`](https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin/blob/6e02423f541cc406e4e41031629609a276a9f481/docs/search_data.json) which is used for docs info template. `lunr.js` combines all of the text from all of the docs in `docs/` into `_site/search_data.json`. It looks like below.

All the info are comes from [Jekyll YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) variables. (i.e. title, group, description.. that's why I rewrote all docs' title and description.)
[search.js](https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin/blob/6e02423f541cc406e4e41031629609a276a9f481/docs/assets/themes/zeppelin/js/search.js) will do this job using this data!

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement & Feature

### Todos
* [x] - Keep consistency for all docs pages' `Title`
* [x] - Add some overview sentences to all docs pages' `Description` section (this will be used as the result preview)
* [x] - Add apache license header to all docs page (some pages are missing the license header currently)
* [x] - Add LICENSE for `lunr.min.js`

### What is this PR for?
This is a small refactoring to keep this Controller following the [ControllerAs with vm](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#controlleras-with-vm)
rules, that it was based on.

Here is a list of things that were changed and why:

* Most of the controller's $scope values & fct (except from the search q) where moved to the vm.The controller is using vm, so storing in $scope to share with the view is not needed.

* Functions or Vars that are not used in the view were removed from the vm. (kept private to the controller)

* $rootscope functions was moved to `app.js`. I think  the need for that function might need to be changed, but for the scope of this PR, we are just moving it to where the $rootScope values are declared.

* Gathering vm declaration before the functions and ordered alphabetically

* Re-order functions alphabetically

* Create `initController ` to regroup all the controller setup.

### What is this PR for?
The Notebook Title Input would not disappear after being edited.
This is a problem made by its plugin elastic-input.
We originally used ng-if instead of ng-show so it doesn't break the Page Print, however that change made the scope value to toggle unusable.
So we added a trustworthy small controller on top of the component.

### What type of PR is it?
Bug Fix

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1276

### How should this be tested?
* Click on the Notebook title
* Try to do: Enter or Esc or Click somewhere else
* The Input border should not be there anymore
* Do the same for the Paragraph
* If you do Print Page there shouldn't any titles duplicated at the top

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? No
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No
* Does this needs documentation? No

### What is this PR for?
PySparkInterpreter doesn't work in spark 2.0 because pyspark and py4j is not distributed to executors.  This PR extract the setup staff for pyspark interpreter into method setupConfForPySpark and use it for both spark1 and spark2. But this is just a short term solution, as I think this should be handled by spark rather than zeppelin, here zeppelin duplicate part of spark's work.

### What is this PR for?
For now, user need to invoke print to make the output displayed on the notebook. This behavior is not natural and consistent with other notebooks. This PR is to make the pyspark interpreter in zeppelin behave the same as other notebook. 2 main changes
* use single mode to compile the last statement, so that the evaluation result of the last statement will be printed to stdout, this is consistent with other notebooks (like jupyter)
* Make SparkOutputStream extends LogOutputStream so that we can see the output of inner process (Python/R), it is helpful for diagnosing.

### What type of PR is it?
[Bug Fix]

### What is the Jira issue?
* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1197

### How should this be tested?
Tested it manually. Input the following text in pyspark paragraph,
```
1+1
sc.version
```
And get the following output
```
u'1.6.1'
```

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? No
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? User don't need to call print explicitly.
* Does this needs documentation? Yes

### What is this PR for?
As new interpreter registration mechanism which was started in [ZEPPELIN-804](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-804), we can't set default interpreter anymore using `zeppelin-site.xml` as described in [https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/install/install.html#apache-zeppelin-configuration](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/install/install.html#apache-zeppelin-configuration) (see `zeppelin.interpreters` property description in the configuration table). So we need to remove the related contents in Zeppelin docs site.

Below pages will be updated:
 - [https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/install/install.html#apache-zeppelin-configuration](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/install/install.html#apache-zeppelin-configuration)

### What is the Jira issue?

### What is this PR for?
For now, we share the same class path for zeppelin server and remote interpreter process. The cause the issue that AM log is not available for yarn-client mode because the yarn app also use the `ZEPPELIN_HOME/conf/log4j.properties` which is only for zeppelin server. So this PR just distinguish the CLASSPATH of zeppelin server and remote interpreter process. I use `ZEPPELIN_INTP_CLASSPATH` to represent the classpath of remote interpreter process and won't include `ZEPPELIN_HOME/conf/log4j.properties` in `ZEPPELIN_INTP_CLASSPATH`.

```
The root cause is that we didn't set property SPARK_YARN_MODE just like spark-shell did.

The following code in Main.scala is what we miss in zeppelin spark interpreter. https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.6/repl/scala-2.11/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/repl/Main.scala
```
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    if (getMaster == ""yarn-client"") System.setProperty(""SPARK_YARN_MODE"", ""true"")
```
Besides that, we need to do login before creating any spark stuff, otherwise will hit the classnotfound issue http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/zeppelin-users/201606.mbox/%3CCAH-=KK2SzsXX5zvfnuoLbB1753Tm196_bcB83NzzooedSbLpRQmail.gmail.com%3E. The cause is that SecurityManager will add secretkey to credential, so before that we should do login, otherwise Executor can not connect to HttpFileServer on driver correctly due to the missing of secretkey.

### What is this PR for?
In order to bust the cache when there is changes to the code of zeppelin-web after build, we are adding hashes at the end of the imported .js and .css files we use.
Every time there is changes in one of those file, the hash will change and the browser will use new file instead of cached one.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1229

### How should this be tested?
* Build zeppelin-web once and write down the HASH in `dist/scripts/scripts.HASH.js`
* After making a change inside a .js file of the application and building again, the hash in `dist/scripts/scripts.HASH.js` should be changed.

### What is this PR for?
The problem is that command ""bash -c <shell scripts>"" will always return 0 as long as the last line of shell script run correctly. e.g the following command will run correctly without any error message.
```
hello
pwd
```
This PR will redirect stderr and stdout to the same place, and will display both the stderr and stdout to frontend just like what user see in the native shell terminal. So the output of above command will be as following
```
bash: hello: command not found

 - restart zeppelin server

expectation is `local-repo` should be recreated with all the dependencies that were mentioned in any of the interpreters.

```

Maybe this error will be gone with `bundle update`. But it would be better we set `safe_yaml` version for the other users. So I just updated `safe_yaml` version from `0.9.7` to `1.0.4` in `Gemfile.lock` manually. And confirmed that there are no compatibility issues with ruby version `2.3.0`(latest stable version), `2.2.1`, `2.1.1` and `2.0.0`(this version is no longer maintained by ruby).

I also updated `docs/README.md` since we need ruby version higher than `2.0.0` not `1.9.3`. Please see [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#requirements).

### What type of PR is it?
Bug Fix & Documentation

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-813](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-813)

### How should this be tested?

###### 1. Apply this patch

```
$ cd docs
$ bundle install
```
If you already installed dependencies before, you need

```
$ bundle update safe_yaml
```

###### 2. Check what version of `safe_yaml` is installed -> `1.0.4` should be installed. Then

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```
It should be run with no issues.

### What is this PR for?
This PR will fix [ZEPPELIN-1109](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1109).
I'm not sure this approach can be the best way for fixing this issue since I would prefer to have the fade-in/out animation for bootstrap dialog. So if anyone has better idea for this, please let me know.

### What type of PR is it?
Bug Fix

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-1109](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1109)

### How should this be tested?
1. Press `Enter` button right after clicking any bootstrap dialog (i.e. trash can icon in the notebook)
-> Bootstrap dialog will be shown up multiple times
2. Apply this patch and [build `zeppelin-web`](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/zeppelin-web#configured-environment)
3. Try number 1 again -> you can see there is no fade animation so you don't have time interval to generate multi dialogs

There is a native service used across the app to take care of re-routing to different page: `$location`, however there has been a few times where `$window.location` is used instead, and people tend to do it in new PR too.

This convert the `$window.location` from the code to use `$location`.

### What is this PR for?
In Zeppelin docs website, there are 4 dropdown menus(Quick Start, Interpreters, Display System and More) in the navbar. Especially **Interpreters** and **More** menu have lots of lists so I made this dropdown menu scrollable in #1004.
Originally the scroll bar is shown up when  a user is trying to scroll down. That's why it's hard to notice there are more menus in the dropdown menu.  See [this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1085).

So I made this scroll bar always visible. But only for chrome & safari. Unfortunately, Firefox doesn't support custom scroll bar. See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18317634/force-visible-scrollbar-in-firefox-on-mac-os-x).
In short, it says
>There is no way to actually ""force"" Firefox render the old-style scrollbar since the default scrollbar used in the system is predefined by the OS itself (note that you can modify which scrollbar you want in System Preferences).

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### TODO
- [x] : test this in major browsers

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-1085](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1085)

### How should this be tested?
[Build the Zeppelin docs website](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/docs#build-documentation) in your local and check the dropdown menu in navbar. The scrollbae has to be shown right after you click **Interpreters** or **More** menu.

### Screenshots (if appropriate)
 - Before : scrollbar is only shown up when you are trying to scroll up & down

When we update interpreter property values, we edit some values and click ""save"" button. Then a bootstrap dialog is show up. In this step, if we click ""cancel"", the updated value is still existed in the table. This new value is not stored actually. After refresh, the original value will be shown.

I just get original InterpreterSetting(`getInterpreterSettings()`) when there is no change(`result`) for fixing this bug.

### What is this PR for?
This PR implements pluggable Application Framework.

Here's summary of the change.

**Applicaiton**

Base class of user application. User application should extends `org.apache.zeppelin.helium.Application`.

It looks like

```java
public abstract class Application {

  /**
   * When application loaded
   * params context Application context
   */
  public Application(ApplicationContext context) {
    this.context = context;
  }

  /**
   * This method can be invoked multiple times before unload(),
   * Invoked just after application loaded or when paragraph output is updated
   * param args Required resources from paragraph
   */
  public abstract void run(ResourceSet args)
      throws ApplicationException, IOException;

  /**
   * this method is invoked just before application is removed
   */
  public abstract void unload() throws ApplicationException;
}
```

**HeliumPackage**

`org.apache.zeppelin.helium.HeliumPackage` keeps information of application package.
Package informations includes

```
{
  type : ""APPLICATION"",                            // type of this package
  name : ""zeppelin.app"",                           // application name. [organizationName].[appName] format
  description : ""App description"",                 // description
  artifact : ""groupId:artifactId:version"",         // artifact name for maven repository
  className : ""org.apache.zeppelin.helium.MyApp"",  // application class that extends org.apache.zeppelin.helium.Application
  resources : [[]],                                // required resource
  icon : '<i class=""fa fa-clock-o""></i>'           // icon
}
```

`resources` field defines what kind of data this application requires, from ResourcePool.
""resourceName"" and "":className"" works in the array.
inner array combines each resourceName, :className with 'AND'
outer array combines inner array with 'OR'.

For example,

```
resources : [
    [ ""name1"", "":java.util.Date""],
    [ ""name1"", ""name2""]
]
```

Then Zeppelin searches ResourcePool, first for resource name ""name1"" and resource type ""java.util.Date"" from resourcePool then resource name ""name1"" and ""name2"".

Once resources are found, they'll be passed to `Application.run()` method

**Package Registry**

`org.apache.zeppelin.helium.HeliumRegistry` provides list of available HeliumPackages.
Currently `HeliumLocalRegistry` is implemented and it provides list by reading HeliumPackage json files under ./helium directory in the file system. Later there will be some class like `HeliumOnlineRegistry'  which reads available package from a community managed online central registry.

**Development mode**
`org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.dev.*` package is provided for development support.
Developer can run their app inside of their IDE, that connects to running Zeppelin instance and display output.

**Application Suggestion**
Once paragraph becomes FINISHED status after run, Zeppelin searches resources from ResourcesPool that belongs to current paragraph. And compare all HeliumPackage if these resources satisfies their requirements ('resources' field). If there're available app, Helium button will be displayed.

User can see and select available application for this paragraph.

**Application selection**
After application is loaded, application icon will be displayed. So user can select and switch between apps.

if built-in visualization is available, application icon will be displayed next to built-in visualizations

**Experimental**

While this is new feature and API and specification may change, i'd suggest mark this feature as a experimental for a while.

Zeppelin is configured with LDAP authentication.

1. Login as 'user1' user and create a notebook ('Untitled Note 1')
2. Try to change the permission of 'Untitled Note 1'. Start typing in owners box -> user1
3. The search box appears with a saved name ' user1' (There is an extra space in front of user1')
4. Then click on the search box item and save the permissions. The permissions that get saved have all got an extra space before the username 'user1' though it is not intended to have that space.
5. Later while trying to change the permissions of notebook as 'user1' user, it will disallow because it recognizes ' user1' (user1 with extra space) as owner instead of plain 'user1'

### What is this PR for?
Currently, when a user who doesn't have a permission for a notebook is trying to access to the notebook, a dialog is shown up. The user can login in this dialog or close it.
But if the user is trying to just close this dialog, the location is not changed and still stay `/notebook/NOTE_ID` with blank page. So the user have to click somewhere manually.

So I just added `$window.history.back()` so that it can go back to previous page.

### What is this PR for?
This PR is fixing the bug by implementing a new layout for the Notebook Dropdown menu.
Reason being that setting a maximum height and having a scrollbar doesn't mix with having bootstrap submenus.

In term of dropdown layout, I think we have 2 options:
* The one I implemented, a tree view similar to the one in the home page, I can probably uniform both of them later. One possible problem is the dropdown width getting bigger and bigger as we indent at each submenu.
* The second one would not have any indent, but use a background color to show elements in the same folder (A grey that goes clearer as we go in the submenus)

<img width=""691"" alt=""screen shot 2016-06-25 at 1 42 41 am"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/710411/16344155/2d387af0-3a76-11e6-87ba-9626d9f17fea.png"">

Reworking the whole notebook list and dropdown will probably need a lot more work later (especially in term of refactoring and code cleaning), so I'm not sure where the scope of this PR should stop, especially with the release coming. I think the layout I implemented is fine to solve the immediate problem, and it is always possible to switch to the layout of option 2 later if we think it is best.

### What is this PR for?
I added auto TOC(Table of Contents) generator for Zeppelin documentation website. TOC can help people looking through whole contents at a glance and finding what they want quickly.

I just added `<div id=""toc""></div>`  to the each documentation header. [`toc`](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-1018?expand=1#diff-85af09fb498a5667ea455391533f945dR3)  recognize `<h2>` & `<h3>` as a title in the docs  and it automatically generate TOC. So I set a rule for this work. (I'll write this rule on `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` or [docs/howtocontributewebsite](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-SNAPSHOT/development/howtocontributewebsite.html)).

```
# Level-1 Heading  <- Use only for the main title of the page
## Level-2 Heading <- Start with this one
### Level-3 heading <- Only use this one for child of Level-2

toc only recognize Level-2 & Level-3
```

Please see the below attached screenshot image.

### What type of PR is it?

### Todos
* [x] - Add TOC generator
* [x] - Apply TOC(`<div id=""toc""></div>`) to every documentation and reorganize each headers(apply the above rule)
* [x] - Fix some broken code block in several docs
* [x] - Apply TOC to `r.md` (Currently R docs has some duplicated info since [this one](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/commit/d5e87fb8ba98f08db5b0a4995104ce19f182c678) and [this one](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/commit/7d6cc7e99154e2d337c11fdf8be1a874ed3e9ada) )
* [x] - Apply TOC to `install.md` after #1010 merged

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-1018](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1018)

### How should this be tested?
1. Apply this patch and build `docs/` with [this guide](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/docs#build-documentation)
2.  Visit some docs page. Then you can see TOC in the header of page.

### What is this PR for?
This PR is to automate release publish to maven repository.
We used to use maven-deploy-plugin and maven-release-plugin for release but somehow it didn't work well with Zeppelin so 0.5.5 and 0.5.6 haven't been published to maven repository.

Publishing release to maven repository will eventually help zeppelin to reduce binary package size by leading users to use Dynamic interpreter loading(#908).
Originally below modules were skipped for maven release
 - all interpreters(except spark)
 - zeppelin-display
 - zeppelin-server
 - zeppelin-distribution

on the other hand this pr will skip only:
 - zeppelin-distribution

### What type of PR is it?
Infra

### Todos

- [x] Check curl networking failure

### What is this PR for?
In the current implementation JDBC interpret only catches SQLException and ClassNotFoundException. However, there can be a case for example NullPointerException or for that matter anything else can be thrown.

### What type of PR is it?
[Improvement]

### Todos
* [x] - increase more logs, and return appropriate error to front-end

### What is the Jira issue?
* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/
* Put link here, and add [ZEPPELIN-*Jira number*] in PR title, eg. [ZEPPELIN-533]

### How should this be tested?
As an example for hive2.

#### Properties

|name|	value|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|default.driver|	org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver|
|default.url	|jdbc:hive2://hive-machine:2181/;serviceDiscoveryMode=zooKeeper;zooKeeperNamespace=hiveserver2|

#### Dependencies

|artifact	|exclude|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|org.apache.hive:hive-jdbc:1.2.1	||
|org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-common:2.7.2||

With the above setting used on an older driver for hive2 it shows exception in log, but on the front-end paragraph shows error, and no logs.

### What is this PR for?
Most of other projects have **Quick Start** or **Getting Started** page for the beginner. Currently, Zeppelin also has [Zeppelin Install](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-SNAPSHOT/install/install.html) which is similar with those kind of instruction page. But it has only contents that explain just installation and configuration. So I updated this page to **Quick Start** so that it can include step by step guide for the beginners.

### How should this be tested?
Create two paragraphs in the notebook
First takes longer than second (last) paragraph.
First paragraph and second paragraph should use different interpreter.

If cron schedule the notebook with 'auto-restart interpreter on cron execution' checked.
Then interpreters will be restarted when second paragraph finished, but first paragraph is still running.
That may cause abort of first paragraph run.

### What is this PR for?
Error:
Insufficient privileges to write notebook.
Allowed users or roles: [admin, zeppelinWrite]
But the user randerson belongs to: [randerson]
It's seems clear that user randerson isn't mapped to any roles, or groups (even though he of course is a member of the zeppelinWrite group in AD and as a result also part of the local admin Role). A TCPDUMP reveals that during login, all of my group memberships are in fact returned during the ldap bind operation. However, when I attempt to modify a notebook, a call is never made to AD, to pull back my group memberships. It doesn't seem to look at my local group memberships (/etc/group) either.

### What is this PR for?
This is firstly to refactor API for versioning and keep everthing inside of one interface (NotebookRepo) instead of two different interfaces (NotebookRepoVersioned). Secondly, there're modifications to existing versioning api, with considerations of future complete implementation of versioning. Note that this PR doesn't implement all suggested interfaces, but lays foundation for their implementation.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement && Refactoring

### Todos
* [x] - move versioning api (get, history) from NotebookRepoVersioned to NotebookRepo
* [x] - refactor and naming changes
* [x] - modify checkpoint api (add return value) and modify NotebookRepoSync to deal with it

### What is the Jira issue?

### How should this be tested?
Basically it doesn't add new functionality, so the only requirement is for tests to pass.

### Screenshots (if appropriate)

### What is this PR for?
When people implement a new interpreter, they extend [interpreter.java](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/Interpreter.java) as described in [here](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-SNAPSHOT/development/writingzeppelininterpreter.html). Among the several methods in [interpreter.java](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/Interpreter.java), [completion API](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/Interpreter.java#L109) enables auto-completion.

However this API is too simple compared to other project's auto-completion and hard to add more at the moment. So for the aspect of further expansion, it would be better to separate and restructure this API before the this release( 0.6.0 ).

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### Todos
* [x] - Create new structure : `InterpreterCompletion` in `RemoteInterpreterService.thrift` and regenerate `zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/thrift/*` files
* [x] - Change all existing `List<String> completion` -> `List<InterpreterCompletion> completion`
* [x] - Change `paragraph.controller.js` to point real `name` and `value`

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-982](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-982)

### How should this be tested?
Since this improvement is just API change, it should work same as before. So after applying this patch, and check whether auto-completion works well or not.

Use `. + ctrl` for auto-completion. For example,

```
%spark
sc.version
```

When after typing `sc.` and pushing  `. + ctrl` down, `version` should be shown in the auto-completion list.

Receive the basic data of Job manager api and the backend have been implemented.

### What type of PR is it?
Feature

### Todos
- [x] - Basic backend for job manager.
- [x] - Basic backend api

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-963

### How should this be tested?
#### step 1.
First, calling the rest api as follows receives the data of ""job"" of the whole.
```shell
curl -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/notebook/jobmanager/
```
result
```json
{
   ""status"":""OK"", // result for api request
   ""body"":{
      ""lastResponseUnixTime"":1465289938763, // last get server unixtime stamp.
      ""jobs"":[  // job list
         {
            ""notebookId"":""2BMQZ9QP6"",  // notebook id.
            ""unixTimeLastRun"":1465289017310, // notebook last running unixtime.
            ""notebookType"":""normal"", // cron or normal
            ""isRunningJob"":false, // is Running?
            ""notebookName"":""Untitled Note 1226"", // notebook name.
            ""interpreter"":""spark"", // default interpreter group name or If you have not selected it does not exist.
            ""paragraphs"":[
               {
                  ""name"":""20160607-174331_232775609"", // paragraph name 'undefined is notebook id'
                  ""id"":""20160607-174331_232775609"", // paragraph id
                  ""status"":""FINISHED"" // paragraph job status
               }
            ]
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

#### step 2.
For example, it showed the result of receiving the information as one of the notebook.
focus on ""lastResponseUnixTime"" value.
This value is inserted as an argument when you call the following restapi, us to be able to get the updated data.

**Create a Notebook, or run the Paragraph.**
And, **call updated notebook api**

**""lastResponseUnixTime"": 1465289938763** (step 1 get value)
```shell
curl -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/notebook/jobmanager/1465289938763
```

#### step 3.
If you created a Notebook, a new Notebook information is displayed.
If there is a Notebook that if there is a Paragraph of the running, the information will also be displayed.

#### step 4.
When you restart the step1 of api, if you created a Notebook, the number of Notebook is +1 than when the first call.

### What type of PR is it?
[Improvement]

### Todos
* [ ] - Test steps executed and confirmed working by the community

### What is the Jira issue?
**[ZEPPELIN-901]**

### How should this be tested?
* Download and install locally **[Cassandra 3.5]**
* Start **Cassandra**
* Clone this pull request locally with:
    * `git fetch origin pull/950/head:CassandraInterpreterV3`
    * `git checkout CassandraInterpreterV3`
* Build this version of **Zeppelin** with `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
* Start Zeppelin and update the property `cassandra.hosts` of the **Cassandra** interpreter (set it to _localhost_ or _127.0.0.1_ depending on your configuration)
* To test the `ALTER` statement, create a new paragraph with the following content:
```
%cassandra

CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS cassandra_v3 WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cassandra_v3.simple(key int PRIMARY KEY);
ALTER TABLE cassandra_v3.simple ADD value text;
DESCRIBE TABLE cassandra_v3.simple;
```
The result of this paragraph should be:

* To test the support for **Zeppelin** dynamic form syntax, create a paragraph with the following content:

```
%cassandra

INSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(1, 'first');
INSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(2, 'second');
INSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(3, 'third');

SELECT * FROM cassandra_v3.simple WHERE key=${key=1};
```
The result of this paragraph should be:

* To test the legacy syntax for dynamic form, create a new paragraph with the following content:

```
%cassandra

INSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(1, 'first');
INSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(2, 'second');
INSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(3, 'third');

SELECT * FROM cassandra_v3.simple WHERE key={{key=1|2|3}};
```
The result of this paragraph should be:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/15740377/ebb018ea-28b4-11e6-9cde-b3aad50bbaef.png)

* To test the override of `AngularObject` upon dynamic form, create 2 new paragraphs with the following content

First paragraph content:
```
%angular

<form class=""form-inline"">
  <div class=""form-group"">
    <label for=""keyId"">Key: </label>
    <input type=""text"" class=""form-control"" id=""keyId"" placeholder=""key id ..."" ng-model=""key_id""></input>
  </div>
  <button type=""submit"" class=""btn btn-primary"" ng-click=""z.angularBind('key_id',key_id,'PUT_HERE_SECOND_PARAGRAPH_ID'); z.runParagraph('PUT_HERE_SECOND_PARAGRAPH_ID')""> Bind</button>
</form>
```
Second paragraph content:
```
%cassandra

INSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(1, 'first');
INSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(2, 'second');
INSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(3, 'third');

SELECT * FROM cassandra_v3.simple WHERE key={{key_id=1}};
```
Replace `PUT_HERE_SECOND_PARAGRAPH_ID` in the angular code of the first paragraph by the real paragraph id of the second paragraph. Execute the first paragraph, put a value into the input text (3) and click on **Bind**, you should see the following result:

### What is this PR for?
Currently Zeppelin provides authorization mechanism on each notebooks. But it seems many users can not get much useful information through [the existing notebook authorization docs](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/security/notebook_authorization.html). So I add some information so that users can follow step by step.

Moreover,  [interpreter authorization docs](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/security/interpreter_authorization.html) doesn't provide much information so far. This can be confused to users. So I removed it temporally. We can add it again when we have specific(?) feature for `interpreter & data source authorization`.

### What is this PR for?
Currently available interpreter list is not shown in `Creating New Interpreter` section. It seems this bug was generated after #835 was merged. So I temporally deactivated [3 SerializedName code lines](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/945/commits/6d7f1bc43437e8a876eef1a3e36a17fbd5805cb1).

### What is this PR for?
Adding a python 2 &3 interpreter. It's a basic implementation (no py4j for example), with a java ProcessBuilder object used to instantiate a python REPL.

The interpreter doesn't bring it own python binary but uses the python specified by python.path configutation. Thus, you can still use your specific installed python modules (scikit-learn, matplotlib...) and the interpreter is able to work with python 2 & 3 without change.

I had a python helper  function (zeppelin_show() ) to easily display matplotlib graph as SVG.

### How should this be tested?

1. In interpreter screen, in Python section, specify in python.path the python binary you want to use
2. In a paragraph, you can use the interpreter with **_%python_**. Calling help() will describe you the interpreter functionnalities.
3. Install py4j (pip install py4j) if you want to use input form

### Description

#### This PR introduce three initialisation mechanism including current one.
* {interpreter_dir}/{interpreter_group}/interpreter-setting.json
* interpreter-settings.json in your interpreter jar
* Current static initialization

#### Initialization step
1. Get {interpreter_dir} from Configuration
1. Get the list of {interpreter_dir}/[{interpreter_group1},{interpreter_group2}...]
1. Find {interpreter_dir}/{interpreter_group1}/interpreter-setting.json
1. Find interpreter-setting.json in the resources of {interpreter_dir}/{interpreter_group1}/**/*.jar
1. Adopt static init
1. Repeat them from the second step with {interpreter_group2}

### What is the Jira issue?

### How should this be tested?
First of all, you may need to create account in [ZeppelinHub](https://www.zeppelinhub.com).
Then you can set connection by following guides in [here](https://github.com/khalidhuseynov/incubator-zeppelin/blob/feat/zeppelinhub-storage/docs/storage/storage.md#notebook-storage-in-zeppelinhub--).
Finally you should be able to access and manipulate your notebooks from inside of your ZeppelinHub account.

### What is this PR for?
Currently, Zeppelin has two authentication docs. One is  [**Authentication**](https://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/security/authentication.html) and the other is [**Shiro Authentication**](https://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/manual/shiroauthentication.html). As a user, it's little bit confused. So I changed the category of `shiroauthentication.md` file from `manual` to `security` and also changed the name of `Authentication` to `Authentication for NGINX`. Please see the below screenshot images :)

### What type of PR is it?

There was a recent PR made by doanduyhai that was changing some images URL to include `../assets`. However, I found a few more cases in the deployed website.

### What is this PR for?
As Zeppelin evolves its notebook, for large scale data analysis, multiple zeppelin users are expected to use and connect to the same set of data repositories within an enterprise. Since Zeppelin notebooks could affect data, state and its lineage, it is important to have separation of users, provide them with appropriate sandboxes, in addition to capturing the right audit details. Further, the IT within the organization would prefer to support fewer Zeppelin instances (preferably one) to support its customers. Therefore, the objectives of creating a multi-tenant zeppelin are:
●	Supporting workloads of multiple customers
●	Supporting multiple LOBs (lines of business), on a single data systems
●	Support fine grained audits
As a natural evolution of Zeppelin Authentication and Authorization design, partly user awareness in downstream data systems such as Spark/Hive and others, is essential to achieve the above stated objectives.

### What type of PR is it?
Feature

### Todos
* [x] - Test case
* [x] - Review Comments
* [x] - Documentation

### What is the Jira issue?
ZEPPELIN-773

### How should this be tested?
 - Install Livy by following steps on https://github.com/cloudera/livy
 - Start the Livy server
 - Now by using Zeppelin-Livy interpreter, run any of the spark, pyspark or R commands.

### What is this PR for?
When we execute Jekyll to build Zeppelin docs, `_site` directory is generated automatically. So I added `_site` to `.gitignore` file.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### Todos
* [x] - Add `_site` dir to `.gitignore` file

### What is the Jira issue?
No

### How should this be tested?
1. Execute Jekyll following as in [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/docs/README.md)
2. Before adding `_site` to `.gitignore`, you can see that `git` is tracking `_site` directory.
3. After applying this PR, `git` doesn't track this directory anymore.

### Screenshots (if appropriate)

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? No
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No
* Does this needs documentation? No

### What is this PR for?
Interpreters listed `/#/interpreter` here are slightly difficult to find, also the list that shows up for adding an interpreter is not sorted which adds effort to find the desired interpreter and the add it.
IMO the list should be sorted and searchable.

### What type of PR is it?
[Improvement]

### Todos
* [x] - Interpreter list sorted.
* [x] - Interpreters should be searchable.

### What is the Jira issue?
* [ZEPPELIN-858](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-858)

### How should this be tested?
Navigate to URL `/#/interpreter`
 - the interpreters listed should be sorted
 - click on add interpreter, the interpreter drop down in ""Create new interpreter"" should also be sorted
 - the search box should search interpreters that are already listed

### What is this PR for?
This JIRA:

* add documentation for the new paragraphId display in the paragraph command dialog. Instead of just adding some description to the paragraphId, I took the opportunity to also document the entire Zeppelin UI Layout and added a menu entry **UI Layout** under menu **QuickStart**. It is inspired by the content of the talk on Zeppelin at different conferences
* rename the menu **Display System** / **Angular** to **Display System** / **Back-end Angular Interactions**
* add a new entry **Front-end Angular Interactions** under the menu **Display System** to describe the new front-end AngularJS API introduced by this epic

_This is a sub-task of epic **[ZEPPELIN-635]**_

### What type of PR is it?

We look for Angular object having same name:

* then at note scope (note id only)

### What is this PR for?

Implement R and SpakR Intepreter as part of the Spark Interpreter Group. It also implements R and Scala binding (in both directions).

### What type of PR is it?

[Feature]

### Todos

* [ ] - Documentation
* [ ] - Unit test (if relevant, as we depend on R being available on the host)
* [ ] - Assess licensing (a priori ok as we don't delive anything out of ASL2, but we should corectly phrase the NOTICE as we depend on non-ASL2 comptabile licenses (R) to run the interpreter).

### Is there a relevant Jira issue?

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-156 SparkR support

### How should this be tested?

You need R available on the host running the notebook.

    For Centos: yum install R R-devel
    For Ubuntu: apt-get install r-base r-cran-rserve

Install additional R packages:

```
curl https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rscala/rscala_1.0.6.tar.gz -o /tmp/rscala_1.0.6.tar.gz
R CMD INSTALL /tmp/rscala_1.0.6.tar.gz
R -e ""install.packages('ggplot2', repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')""
R -e install.packages('knitr', repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```

- Build + launch Zeppelin and test the R note.

!!! you need rscala_1.0.6 (if not, you need to build with -Drscala.version=...)

This is the initial PR for an R Interpreter for Zeppelin.  There's still some work to be done (e.g., tests), but its useable, it brings to Zeppelin features from R like its library of statistics and machine learning packages, as well as advanced interactive visualizations.  So I'd like to open it up for others to comment and/or become involved.

 Summary:

- There are two interpreters, one emulates a REPL, the other uses knitr to weave markdown and formatted R output.  The two interpreters share a single execution environment.

- Visualisations:  Besides R's own graphics, this also supports interactive visualizations with googleVis and rCharts.  I am working on htmlwidgets (almost done) with the author of that package, and a next-step project is to get Shiny/ggvis working.  Sometimes, a visualization won't load until the page is reloaded.  I'm not sure why this is.

- Licensing:  To talk to R, this integrates code forked from rScala.  rScala was released with a BSD-license option, and the author's permission was obtained.

- Spark:  Getting R to share a single spark context with the Spark interpreter group is going to be a project.  For right now, the R interpreters live in their own ""r"" interpreter group, and new spark contexts are created on startup.

- Zeppelin Context:  Not yet integrated, in significant part because there's no ZeppelinContext to talk to until it lives in the Spark interpreter group.

- Documentation:  A notebook is included that demonstrates what the interpreter does and how to use it.

- Tests:  Working on it...

P.S.:  This is my first PR on a project of this size; let me know what I messed up and I'll try to fix it ASAP.

### What is this PR for?
Add notification system for AngularJS z functions. Now that we expose the `z` Angular object, we should also catch error/exceptions and display error messages properly to the user.

I changed a little bit the default settings for **ngToast**. Instead of having notifications on **bottom right**, I let the default value undefined.

For **Interpreter** page notification, I force the position to **bottom right** as before when using default config.

For `z` functions error messages, I choose to display notifications on **top right** corner because it's clearer. See screen capture

### What is this PR for?
HBase interpreter fails with message ""ERROR: KeeperErrorCode = ConnectionLoss for /hbase"" when connecting to a remote HBASE (for instance, HBase running in CDH cluster)

Initially it's thought that zkquoram setttings are not getting applied, but deeper investigations reveal that hbase-site.xml cannot be loaded.

HBASE_HOME or HBASE_CONF_DIR is set by `hbase` script when running hbase shell - interpreter will need to at minimum replicate that behavior to add the directory with hbase-site.xml to CLASS_PATH in order to fix this issue.

### What is this PR for?
Add AngularJS `z.runParagraph()` method

corneadoug
On the client-side, inside the scope of a paragraph, we cannot access to the list of all existing paragraphs for the current note. In my previous implementation, I was using the following trick:

```
var paragraphDiv = angular.element('#' + paragraphId +
                                '_paragraphColumn_main[ng-controller=""ParagraphCtrl""]');

var paragraph = paragraphDiv.scope().paragraph;
```

This is **dirty** and can be broken if we change the CSS style tomorrow for paragraph.

For the current implementation, what I did is to **inject** a reference to the `note` object into the `$scope` of paragraph so that we can access the current list of paragraph **programmatically**:

```javascript
        $scope.$broadcast('updateParagraph', {
          note: $scope.note, // pass the note object to paragraph scope
          paragraph: note.paragraphs[index]});
```

```html
  <div id=""{{currentParagraph.id}}_paragraphColumn_main""
       ng-repeat=""currentParagraph in note.paragraphs""
       ng-controller=""ParagraphCtrl""
       ng-Init=""init(currentParagraph, note)""

### What is this PR for?
This is with respect to travis build failure on `sendKeys`.

An implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find an element or elements if they are not immediately available. The default setting is 0. Once set, the implicit wait is set for the life of the WebDriver object instance.

Travis mostly fails on `sendKeys`; hence, change the way text is sent to paragraph.

### What is this PR for?
Add client-side `z` object with method `angularBind()`

Leemoonsoo

Compared to the original implementation, I have simplified a lot.

Now, you can only bind angular variable to one unique scope, which is the **paragraph**. I just remove the note scope and also remove the `interpreter` parameter.

Indeed, when passing a `paragraphId`, on the server-side, we can retrieve the `Paragraph` object with the `noteId` + `paragraphId` so we can now which interpreter is currently being used.

The signature of the `angularBind(varName, value, paragraphId)` method has also been greatly simplified.

### What is this PR for?
ResourcePool is introduced by ZEPPELIN-619.
However, it didn't provide any automatic resource release on paragraph / note removal unlike paragraph scope angular object which is quite helpful in practical use.

This PR adds noteId and paragraphId to ResourceId, so resource can be identified by noteId and paragraphId in addition to resourcePoolId and name.
By using informations in ResourceId, automatically release resource when note / paragraph remove.

So now, it's possible to put InterpreterResult into the resource pool safely, which might be useful for ZEPPELIN-374 and ZEPPELIN-533.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### Todos
* [x] - Add noteId and paragraphId to ResourceId
* [x] - Release resource when note / paragraph remove
* [x] - Put InterpreterResult into resource pool
* [x] - Unit test

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-713

### How should this be tested?
You can get resourcePool from InterpreterContext and print items inside of spark interpreter. (note. resource pool is not spark interpreter specific feature. But so far spark interpreter provides user api to access it)

You can see InterpreterResult is automatically shared to resourcePool and they're removed on note/paragraph remove.

```
%md
hello world

%spark
// print items in resource pool.
import collection.JavaConversions._
val pool = z.getInterpreterContext.getResourcePool
pool.getAll.foreach(i=>println(i + "" "" + i.get))

### What is this PR for?
The Spark interpreter currently honors whatever is set for spark.executor.memory in spark-defaults.conf upon startup, but if you look at the Interpreter page, you'll see that it has a default of 512m. If you restart a running Spark interpreter from this page, the new SparkContext will use this new default of spark.executor.memory=512m instead of what it had previously pulled from spark-defaults.conf.

Removing this 512m default from SparkInterpreter code will allow spark.executor.memory to default to whatever value may be set in spark-defaults.conf, falling back to the Spark built-in default (which, btw, has for a few Spark versions been 1g, not 512m anymore).

### What is the Jira issue?

### How should this be tested?
* Set spark.executor.memory to some value in spark-defaults.conf (say, 5120m)
* Run a Spark paragraph in Zeppelin
 * The Spark application will correctly use the spark.executor.memory value from spark-defaults.conf (both before and after this change).
* View Interpreter page in Zeppelin UI
 * Before this change: spark.executor.memory will be displayed as 512m instead of what is in spark-defaults.conf
 * After this change: spark.executor.memory will be blank
* Restart Spark Interpreter from this page and run a Spark paragraph
 * Before this change: the new Spark application will incorrectly use the spark.executor.memory=512m value shown on the Interpreter page

### What is this PR for?
When a user runs Spark interpreter, the result will come out with result number message like :
```
res0: Int = 250
```
Someone might want to print this REPL output with their result, but others may want to see the result only since sometimes this output is too verbose. So, I just want to give an option to hide this REPL output to those users.

The default value of `zeppelin.spark.printREPLOutput` is `true`. This status is as-is. Users can hide REPL output only when they changes this property `true` to `false`. In this case, they can check the result by specifying such as `print(some_variable)`.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### Todos
* [x] - Add a property `zeppelin.spark.printREPLOutput`
* [x] - Add Spark interpreter property table to `docs/spark.md`

### What is the Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-688](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-688#)

### How should this be tested?
After applying this PR,
  1. Create spark interpreter for this test and change `zeppelin.spark.printREPLOutput` property value `true` -> `false`
  2. Create a notebook and bind interpreter what you made.
  3. Write `val a = 250` down and run this paragraph. Then you can check the any output is not shown although paragraph status is **FINISHED** (This is the result of this PR).
  4. Run `print(a)` in the next paragraph. Then finally you can get a result `250`.

### What is this PR for?

If you change the intrepreter setting via the UI, the updated values are sent to the REST API but the JSON response coming back from the server contains the previous values (not the updated ones).

This is a regression probably introduced recently.

### What is this PR for?
ZeppelinContext may not be initialized properly in concurrent mode:

When I create & run multiple notebooks using rest API concurrently, I can see such errors if the jobs trying to use ZeppelinContext:
```
<console>:23: error: not found: value z
```

I think this issue can be reproduced by:
1. create 4 - 5 new notebooks with content: `println(z)`
2. use rest API to run the newly created notebooks concurrently

It seems the issue is gone after I expand the lock to protect the whole process of spark REPL initializing / binding.

### What is this PR for?

Currently, all notebooks that binded to the same interpreter setting shares the same interpreter instance.
For example, let's say there're `spark-production` interpreter setting and all notebooks are using it.
Then all notebooks share a single instance of SparkInterpreter, and that result all the variables are being shared across the notebook.

But sometimes isolated name space for variables per notebook is preferred. In this case we can create per notebook interpreter instance.

This PR provides generalized facility to provides per notebook interpreter instance, not only for SparkInterpreter but for any other existing interpreter without modification.

**Design**

It provides toggle switch that user turn on / turn off this mode per interpreter setting.
When per notebook interpreter is turned on, it still creates a single remote interpreter process per interpreter setting. But inside of the process, each notebook will have it's own interpreter instance and the instance is terminated automatically on removal of notebook or unbinding note from interpreter setting.

**SparkInterpreter**

Because of the design keeps single remote interpreter process and creates multiple interpreter instance inside of it, SparkInterpreter become a problem. While multiple SparkContext can not be created on a single process. So this PR try to, create per notebook scala compiler instance, but share single SparkContext instance. In this way, each notebook can run job concurrently by leveraging fairscheduler of SparkContext without running multiple Spark application (SparkContext).

And this approach is inspired by https://github.com/piyush-mukati/incubator-zeppelin/tree/parallel_scheduler_support_spark, this PR trying to generalize it for all other interpreters.

### What type of PR is it?
Feature

### Todos
* [x] - Per note interpreter session
* [x] - Scala compiler instance per note and share a single SparkContext (SparkInterpreter)
* [x] - Handle Spark class server correctly
* [x] - Handle SparkInterpreter Progressbar correctly

### Is there a relevant Jira issue?

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-513

### How should this be tested?

Check ""Per note session"" of your Spark interpreter setting.
And create two different notebook and check scala variables are not shared.

Although Shell Interpreter has already had [command timeout property](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/shell/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/shell/ShellInterpreter.java#L49), users can not change this property via Zeppelin UI. So I added some code lines to `ShellInterpreter.java` so that users can change this value at the interpreter setting tab.

After applying this PR, you can make `%sh` interpreter at the Zeppelin interpreter setting section.
  1. Change `shell.command.timeout.millisecs` 600000(default value) -> 5000 so that you can check quickly
  2. Run

### What is this PR for?
pyspark.zip, py4j-\*.zip should be distributed to yarn nodes to make pyspark function but this hasn't been working after #463 because [`if (pythonLibs.length == pythonLibUris.size())`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/spark/SparkInterpreter.java#L329) condition will never be true. This PR fixes this issue by changing this if condition to be  `pythonlibUris.size() == 2`, while integer 2 refers pyspark.zip and py4j-\*.zip.

In addition, yarn-install documentation has been updated.

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? N/A
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? N/A
* Does this needs documentation? Possibly, not sure HBase doc is the right place - there should be a vendor specific doc perhaps

In current behaviour we have a fixed height for result container that contains either graph or table, but if type is text then the container expands to infinitely.

When type is text; then this is mostly logs, so we can have scroll around it and have fixed height for this container.

### What is this PR for?
While investigating CI failure with PR #706, I noticed that we were running all tests in each of 6 jobs in the test matrix.

It seems we have accidentally switched back to running all tests even with older versions of Spark. (from PR #626

Filtering out interpreter tests for these runs help make test jobs faster (~30%) and also reduce the chance that an interpreter test might intermittently fail, thus hopefully improve CI reliability.

Also changing Spark 1.2.1 to 1.2.2 (last 1.2.x release)

* Create the following dataset in Cassandra:
    * `CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};`
    * `CREATE TABLE test.data(id int PRIMARY KEY, val text);`
    * `INSERT INTO test.data(id,val) VALUES(1, 'one');`
    * `INSERT INTO test.data(id,val) VALUES(2, 'two');`
    * `INSERT INTO test.data(id,val) VALUES(3, 'three');`
* Edit the Spark interpreter to add this property
    * spark.cassandra.connection.host: 127.0.0.1

### What is this PR for?
The current default name for a notebook in create dialog is random, which is difficult to remember.
Instead of randomly generating names it's useful to have a prefix ""Untitled Note "" + seq number.
eg: Untitled Note 1, Untitled Note 2 etc.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### How should this be tested?
Create note with default names populated in the field and check if the naming sequence is correct.
When there are no notes with ""Untitled Note <num>"" the default name should be ""Untitled Note 1"", otherwise it should be max num + 1.

### What is this PR for?
This PR has for goal to help people build Zeppelin when phantomJS is not working properly on their machine:
* [Some Problems Here](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-zeppelin-users/201509.mbox/%3CCAKhwvQtTCDeXaQOhpu+wvxPj1io4ra+dG=mEQE7eVR5xboB8eAmail.gmail.com%3E)

* And more

Currently, you have to edit some code in order to bypass the test launched by grunt, and it doesn't seem right for `-DskipTests` to no skip the WebApp tests.

In order to apply that rule, we need to bump the version of `frontend-maven-plugin` to 0.0.25. Sadly they do not have a changelog, so we need to make sure everything is alright.

Support for Hbase Shell. All the commands documented here https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/Shell is supported.

 Requirements:

 Hbase Shell should be installed on the same machine. To be more specific, the following dir. should be available: https://github.com/apache/hbase/tree/master/hbase-shell/src/main/ruby
 Hbase Shell should be able to connect to the Hbase cluster from terminal. This makes sure that the client is configured properly.
 The interpreter takes 3 config parameters:

 hbase.home: Root dir. where hbase is installed. Default is /usr/lib/hbase/
 hbase.ruby.sources: Dir where shell ruby code is installed. Path is relative to hbase.home. Default: lib/ruby
 hbase.irb.load: (Testing only) Default is true. Whether to load irb in the interpreter.

### What is this PR for?
With this PR user will be able to set external libraries to be loaded to specific interpreter.

Note that the scope of this PR is downloading libraries to local repository, not distributing them to other nodes. Only spark interpreter distributes loaded dependencies to worker nodes at the moment.

Here is a brief explanation how the code works.
1. get rest api request for interpreter dependency setting from front-end
2. download the libraries in `ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo` and copy them to `ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/{interpreterId}`
3. `ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/{interpreterId}/*.jar` are added to interpreter classpath when interpreter process starts

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### Todos
* [x] Add tests
* [x] Update docs

### Is there a relevant Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-630

### How should this be tested?
1. Add repository(in interpreter menu, click gear button placed top right side)

    ```
id: spark-packages
url: http://dl.bintray.com/spark-packages/maven
snapshot: false
    ```
2. Set dependency in spark interpreter(click edit button of spark interpreter setting)

    ```
artifact: com.databricks:spark-csv_2.10:1.3.0
    ```
3. Download example csv file

    ```
$ wget https://github.com/databricks/spark-csv/raw/master/src/test/resources/cars.csv
    ```
4. run below code in paragraph

    ```
val df = sqlContext.read
    .format(""com.databricks.spark.csv"")
    .option(""header"", ""true"") // Use first line of all files as header
    .option(""inferSchema"", ""true"") // Automatically infer data types

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? No
* Is there breaking changes for older versions?
  - For the users who use rest api for creat/update interpreter setting, `dependencies` object should be added to request payload.
  - %dep interpreter is deprecated. The functionality is still there, but recommend to load third party dependency via interpreter menu.

* Does this needs documentation? Yes

### What is this PR for?
[Angular display system](http://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/displaysystem/angular.html) provides way to Interpreter interact with front-end.

However, the api was pretty much low level and not very much intuitive, it was difficult to make readable code. This PR provides simple intuitive API for using angular display system by leveraging scala.xml. Following is usage

Import

```scala
// notebook scope
import org.apache.zeppelin.display.angular.notebookscope._
import AngularElem._
```

or

```scala
// paragraph scope
import org.apache.zeppelin.display.angular.paragraphscope._
import AngularElem._
```

Display element

```scala
// automatically convert to string and print with %angular display system directive in front.
<div><div>.display
```

Event handler

```scala
// on click
<div></div>.onClick(() => {
   my callback routine
}).display

// on change
<div></div>.onChange(() => {
  my callback routine
}).display

// arbitrary event
<div></div>.onEvent(""ng-click"", () => {
  my callback routine
}).display
```

Bind model

```scala
// bind model
<div></div>.model(""myModel"").display

// bind model with initial value
<div></div>.model(""myModel"", initialValue).display
```

Interact with model
```scala
// read model
AngularModel(""myModel"")()

// update model
AngularModel(""myModel"", ""newValue"")
```

Right now the keyboard shortcut modal shows 'alt' but on macs 'alt' maps to 'opt'. Could be confusing to some people who don't see 'alt' on the keyboard on their macs.

### What is this PR for?
Output from interpreter is displayed after completion of paragraph execution.
It'll be useful if output can be streamed to front-end during execution.

Previous work #593 injects InterpreterOutput stream object to Interpreter.
This PR is based on #593 and stream the data from InterpreterOutput to front-end.

This implementation only streams output is %text. Other output type (%html, %angular, %table) is not streamed to the front end.

While this PR keeps backward compatibility, Interpreter who want to use this feature will need to modify code to write output into `InterpreterOutput` instead of return with `InterpreterResult`.

This PR includes modification of SparkInterpreter to use InterpreterOutput.

### What type of PR is it?
Feature

Set `spark.yarn.isPython` to be `true` to distribute pyspark libraries to workers when master is `yarn-client`

### What type of PR is it?
Bug Fix

### Is there a relevant Jira issue?
[ZEPPELIN-572](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-572)

### How should this be tested?
You need yarn cluster to test this PR.
Simple way to test this PR would be running below code in paragraph and see if it throws error.
```
%pyspark
print(sc.parallelize([1, 2]).count())
```
And you should be able to see that `spark.yarn.isPython` is set to `true` in **Spark UI > Environment > Spark Properties** only when you set spark.master as `yarn-client`.

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? No
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No
* Does this needs documentation? No

Hi,

I've refactored some of the selenium related test case, and added firebug and firepath for debugging so that if CI is failing on travis it can be debugged on local.

Also I feel that we should delete notebook once selenium test case is finished.

### What is this PR for?
This PR has for goal to allow the user to search through the code in all the paragraphs *and notebook names* in all the notebooks

It add a simple 'search bar' to the nav-bar of Zeppelin WebApp, and an in-memory fulltext search index of paragraphs to the backend.

The search is pretty basic now, fine-tuning it for better search over all types of source code will be a subject of further work.

This PR is related to [this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-490?jql=project%20%3D%20ZEPPELIN).
Current `dynamicform.md` is little bit hard to distinguish each category.
So, I applied `nav-tabs` by using Bootstrap.

This is very basic implementation of the [ZEPPELIN-143](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-143) at the backend.

It makes a local git repository our of your `/notebook` dir and commits a new revision for each save/update.

It does not:
 - add any remotes to the git repo. It is totally possible to do that manually though. It would be interesting to add this later, to be able to push the notebook to hostings like GH
 - have any GUI modifications. It is left as further work, to add the ability for a user to switch ""versions"" of the notebook,  navigating between previous runs.

Feedback is very welcome!

This script creates a virtual machine that launches a repeatable, known set of core dependencies required for developing Zeppelin.  It can also be used to run an existing Zeppelin build if you don't plan to build from source.  For pyspark users, this script also includes several helpful Python Libraries and one obscure configuration to help with matplotlib plotting inside Zeppelin.

The virtual machine consists of:

 - Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS
 - Node.js 0.12.7
 - npm 2.11.3
 - ruby 1.9.3 + bundler, rake, make (only required for building jekyll documentation)
 - Maven 3.3.3
 - Git
 - Unzip
 - libfontconfig to avoid phatomJs missing dependency issues
 - openjdk-7-jdk
 - Python addons: pip, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, pandas
 - Changes are made to the python backend configuration so that pyspark can render matplotlib plots without an interactive window

test-schedule can fail when it starts late in a second, as the result will then return the next second due to in-system delays (particularly cron not reacting in time to config.put(cron, null)).
Adding an additional waiting second before measuring dateFinished allows us to take a value that is independent of a possible lagging execution, waiting another second makes sure that the process has properly stopped.

Alternatively, we can test the time and make sure to not write to cron when just before the full second - that would be quicker (less waiting) but slightly more hacky.

Please review.

Make it configurable via `zeppelin.dep.additionalRemoteRepository`, with spark-packages default. This enables notebook to load dependencies with having to add spark-packages each time.

This test failed randomly during a build. To make sure this is not due to timing issues, we can optionally wait an additional .5 seconds.
This is a band-aid around bad design, but I'm pragmatically trying to get the build to be more stable. This should also help determine if there is an actual (randomly striking) issue in the underlying procedure being tested, by making the test more reliable.

Please review, and if you can come up with a better designed test (and avoid waiting for threads to finish in a fixed time interval) we should discuss it here or in the issue.

The Zeppelin-Web module uses PhantomJS to run Karma JS unit tests. The test suite uses port 8080 by default and is supposed to detect port conflicts. However, on OSX, port conflicts are not detected correctly, and the tests time out causing the Zeppelin build to fail.

I noticed that the test suite also uses port 9001- since 9002 is an uncommonly used port and is close to already used 9001, this PR changes the PhantomJS default port to 9002, allowing builds to proceed successfully.

In the notebook list, the notebooks that have been created without name (empty name) and prefixed with 'Note' are not ordered correctly with the others.

The reason behind it, is that when notebook doesn't have a name, we use the notebook id and prefix it by 'Note'. At that time the list was already ordered and therefore the Name shown doesn't match the position in the list.

Before:

The Fix I have is to have an ordering function at the place we prefix the 'Note' on the front side.
Another solution could be to just to have by default the notebook name as 'Note ' + note.id when we create a note. The second option could probably be better performance wise, however it wouldn't be backward compatible.

The `FlinkInterpreter` only captures output to `Console` and, thus, misses all output which goes to `System.out`. Some of Flink's functions, such as `DataSet[T].print()`, print their results to `System.out`. Consequently Zeppelin's interpreter misses this output.

Here are the mode autodetection rules (and optimizations):
- Evaluates the editor mode on each `aceChange` event.
- (Optimization 1) Evaluates the mode only if the cursor is within the first 30 characters of the buffer.
- (Optimization 2) Sets the mode (e.g. `session.setMode(new mode)` ) only if the new mode differs from the previous one.

Also the mode tag detection structure is refactored to bring together the interpreter tag test and the mode reference. The convention looks like this:
```javascript
  var editorModes = [
     [<Your Mode 1 Reg Expression Test>, <ACE Mode 1>],
     ......
     [<Your Mode N Reg Expression Test>, <ACE Mode N>]
  ];
```
For example:
```javascript
  var editorModes = [
     [/^%spark/, 'ace/mode/scala'],
     [/^%(\w*\.)?\wql/, 'ace/mode/sql'],
     [/^%md/, 'ace/mode/markdown'],

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-262

This patch make zeppelin uses spark-submit to run spark interpreter process, when SPARK_HOME is defined. This will potentially solve all the configuration problems related to spark interpreter.

#### How to use?

Define SPARK_HOME env variable in conf/zeppelin-env.sh
Then it'll use your SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit, so you will not need any additional configuration :-)

#### Backward compatibility

If You have not defined your SPARK_HOME, you still able to run spark interpreter in old (current) way.
However it is not encouraged anymore.

Zeppelin currently embeds all spark dependencies under interpreter/spark and loading them on runtime.

Which is useful because of user can try Zeppelin + Spark with local mode without installation and configuration of spark.

However, when user has existing spark and hadoop installation, it'll be really helpful to just pointing them instead of build zeppelin with specific version of spark and hadoop combination.

This PR implements ability to use external spark and hadoop installation, by doing

* spark-dependencies module packages spark/hadoop dependencies under interpreter/spark/dep, to support local mode (current behavior)
* When SPARK_HOME and HADOOP_HOME is defined, bin/interpreter.sh exclude interpreter/spark/dep from classpath and include system installed spark and hadoop into the classpath.

This patch makes Zeppelin binary independent from spark version. Once Zeppelin is been built, SPARK_HOME can point any version of spark.

z.show() doesn’t seem to work properly in Python – I see the same error below: “AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute '_get_object_id'""
#Python/PySpark – doesn’t work
rdd = sc.parallelize([""1"",""2"",""3""])
Data = Row('first')
df = sqlContext.createDataFrame(rdd.map(lambda d: Data(d)))
print df
print df.collect()
z.show(df)
AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute ‘_get_object_id'

More generally, ZeppelinContext methods are not working with Python objects since Py4J would need to know how to serialize it

It turns out the error is caused by Py4J trying to auto convert the DataFrame, which fails since it can only do that for simple types.
Instead of getting conversion to work, the better approach is to pass along the inner java object instead. To do that we intercept the call on the python side with a wrapper object instead of letting Py4J handle it.
As per comment, adding container/dictionary methods to allow for string passing using ZeppelinContext

The existing code  ($rootScope.$emit('sendNewEvent',...)) emits events to the  ""sendNewEvent"" channel but apparently there are no listener listening to it!

The websocketMsgSrv service exposes a completion() method that is not used. The WS communication goes through this webscket service so it seemed natural to use it for the completion method as well.

This change fixes the event flow problem. You can trace that COMPLETION events go down to the Interceptor's compete method and back to the completers $scope.$on('completionList') handler.

It seems though that the SparkInteprteer's completer doesn't work. It never returns completion suggestions. But this is would be a different issue.

This is a Cassandra interpreter for Zeppelin.

I tried to make the code as clean & modular as possible. The code coverage is quite high with 75+ tests (unit tests + integration tests).

Below are the features of the interpreters:

- support single-line and multi-line comments
- one CQL statement can span many line
- a magic `prefix` system to pass in runtime parameters to queries
- support for preparing statements before-hand and injecting bound values to prepared statements
- parallel execution of each paragraphs
- the last statement is displayed as tabular data if it is a SELECT statement. For non SELECT statements, execution statistics are returned
- simple syntax validation by the interpreter, CQL syntax validation is delegated to Cassandra
- support for Zeppelin dynamic form with the mustache syntax {{input_name=default value}} or {{select_name=val1 | val2 | ... | valN}}

For all the details about the features of this interpreter, please read the doc **[here]**

Tutorial notebook is downloading data using `wget` and unzip and load the csv file.
This works only in local-mode and not going to work with cluster deployments.

Discussed solution in the issue ZEPPELIN-55 are

 * Upload data to HDFS
 * Upload data to S3

However, not all user will install HDFS, and accessing S3 via hdfs client needs accessKey and secretKey in configuration.

this PR make tutorial notebook independent from any filesystem, by reading data from http(s) address and parallelize directly.

Here's how this PR loads data
```
// load bank data
val bankText = sc.parallelize(
    IOUtils.toString(
        new URL(""https://s3.amazonaws.com/apache-zeppelin/tutorial/bank/bank.csv""),
        Charset.forName(""utf8"")).split(""\n""))

case class Bank(age: Integer, job: String, marital: String, education: String, balance: Integer)

val bank = bankText.map(s => s.split("";"")).filter(s => s(0) != ""\""age\"""").map(
    s => Bank(s(0).toInt,

Until now, to display data as a table, there are 2 alternatives:

1. Either use **Spark DataFrame** and Zeppeline built-in support
2. Or generate manually a `println(%table ...)`. As an example of displaying an `RDD[(String,String,Int)]` representing a collection of users:

```scala
val data = new java.lang.StringBuilder(""%table Login\tName\tAge\n"")
rdd.foreach {
   case (login,name,age) => data.append(s""$login\t$name\t$age\n"")
}

println(data.toString())
```

My proposal is to add a new utility function to make creating tables easier that the code example above. Of course one can always use **Spark DataFrame** but I find it quite restrictive. People using Spark versions lesser than 1.3 cannot rely on DataFrame and sometimes one does not want to transform an RDD to DataFrame for display.

How are the utility functions implemented ?

1. I added a new module **spark-utils** which provide Scala code for display utility functions. This module will use the **maven-scala-plugin** to compile all the classes in package `org.apache.zeppelin.spark.utils`.

2. Right now the package `org.apache.zeppelin.spark.utils` only contains 1 object `DisplayUtils` which augments RDDs/**Scala Traversable** of Tuples or case classes (all of them sub-class of trait `Product`) with the new method `displayAsTable(columnLabels: String*)`.

3. The `DisplayUtils` object is imported automatically into the `SparkInterpreter` with `intp.interpret(""import org.apache.zeppelin.spark.utils.DisplayUtils._"");`

4. The Maven module **interpreter** will now have a **runtime** dependency on the module **spark-utils** so that the utility class will be loaded at runtime

5. Usage of the new display utility function is:

    **Paragraph1**
    ```scala
    case class Person(login: String, name: String, age: Int)
    val rddTuples:RDD[(String,String,Int)] = sc.parallelize(List((""jdoe"",""John DOE"",32),(""hsue"",""Helen     SUE"",27))
    val rddCaseClass:RDD[Person] = sc.parallelize(List(Person(""jdoe"",""John DOE"",32),Person(""hsue"",""Helen SUE"",27))
    ```
    **Paragraph2**
    ```scala
    rddTuples.displayAsTable(""Login"",""Name"",""Age"")
    ```

    **Paragraph3**
    ```scala
    rddCaseClass.displayAsTable(""Login"",""Name"",""Age"")
    ```

6. The `displayAsTable()` method is error-proof, meaning that if the user provides **more** columns label that the number of elements in the tuples/case class, the extra column labels will ignored. If the user provides **less** column labels than expected, the method will pad missing column headers with **Column2**, **Column3** etc ...

7. In addition to the `displayAsTable` methods, I added some other utility methods to make it easier to handle custom HTML and images:
    a. calling `html()` will generate the string `""%html ""`
    b. calling `html(""<p> This is a test</p>)` will generate the string `""%html <p> This is a test</p>""`
    c. calling `img(""http://www.google.com"")` will generate the string `""<img src='http://www.google.com' />""`
   d. calling `img64()` will generate the string `""%img ""`
   e. calling `img64(""ABCDE123"")` will generate the string `""%img ABCDE123""`

Of course the `DisplayUtils` object can be extended with new other functions to support future advanced displaying features

Flink people helped a lot to write the interpreter. Thanks so much! Some codes are copied from Flink's development branch. Once Flink releases 0.9, copied code and snapshot repository configuration will be removed.

#### Build

if there're no options, by default it is building against flink 0.9.0-milestone-1.
With combination of Zeppelin, it is good idea to use 0.9-SNAPSHOT, because of it support .collect() that helps really a lot to get results data and display it on Zeppelin.

So, you might want to build in this way,

```
mvn package -Dflink.version=0.9-SNAPSHOT -DskipTests
```

When Zeppelin constructs JVM CLASSPATH, it adds path of every single jar. That creates really long CLASSPATH and it may cause some problem like https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-68.
This PR solves it by constructing CLASSPATH with wildcard.

Another problem is, Zeppelin constructs CLASSPATH with duplicated entry or not related entry.
This PR solves it by constructing CLASSPATH not in common.sh but in each script zeppelin-daemon.sh, interpreter.sh, zeppelin.sh while they need different entry in CLASSPATH.

When there is an error from Spark, the original error is not returned as output in the cell, instead a generic Py4JError is shown.

While it is possible to look at zeppelin-interpreter-spark-root-node.log, it might not be accessible for a multi-user environment as it will require remote access to the host running Zeppelin.

Before:

```

```

```scala

// bind 'varName' variable with 'v' value
z.angularBind(varName: String, v: Object)

// unbind 'varName'
z.angularUnbind(varName: String)

// get value of 'varName'
z.angular(varName:String)

// add watcher to 'varName' variable.
// that is monitoring change and run 'func' when it is changed.
z.angularWatch(varName:String, func: (Object, Object) => Unit))

// remove watcher from 'varName'
z.angularUnwatch(varName:String)
```

Any paragraph's output starting with '%angular'  will be considered as angular code. %angular as a interpreter also available.
