Stick with the simple: if @param in comment, use that, otherwise

This change eliminates support for the syntax where one defines

very silly syntax anyway as one can't use it when one also wants
to document the variable.  So it's now gone and we have simplified

With the 0.11.x therubyracer is attempting to use the system libv8,
and you have to install the libv8 gem by yourself when the system doesn't
have the libv8 available.  Additionally the compilation of libv8 is
quite time-taking and on some systems (like those with old Python)
will fail.  So lets hope these things get sorted out.

Suppose we're using JSDuck to generate guides from the following directory
structure:

somedir/
  guides.json
  guides/
    getting_started/
      README.md
      some-image.png
    nested/
      first_guide/
        README.md
        one.png
      second_guide/
        README.md
        one.png

In JSDuck's generated HTML, image tags in the Getting Started guide will point
to the correct path relative to the page (e.g.
'guides/guide_getting_started/some-image.png'). However, the nested guides will
specify the wrong paths to images: JSDuck will write
'guides/first_guide/one.png' instead of the correct
'guides/guide_nested_first_guide/one.png'.

This patch fixes the issue by generating the image's path based on the full
name of the guide, instead of using 'File.basename' to incorrectly crop the
path."

Nested groups can be defined as follows:

    [{

In UI the tree will then show subfolders for the nested asset groups.
But the ThumbList display will still show all the assets in old way,
and the assets in subgroups will be expanded so they will appear as if
they were listed directly inside the top level group.

I guess in some way this beats the whole point of having the subgroups -
as all the assets still show up on the main page as if there were no
subgroups at all.  On the other hand we now technically have support for
subgroups, but I feel that's not really what these users were after when
they asked for nested grouping.

Additionally eliminated :dup_asset warning.  It didn't fit nicely to the
new way of iterating over assets, and I think it wasn't such a useful
warning anyway."

The code for warning about statics in singleton moved to Lint.

Related to this there's one change in behavior - static members
in singleton are no more cursed into instance members.  That's
because a singleton actually can contain static members, though
it's silly and JSDuck warns about that, but you can even access
those static members in a clumsy way:

    MySingleton.statics().staticMethod();

This is where statics: {} end up when you define them in Ext 4 way
inside a singleton class.  And I've seen some classes in Ext/Touch
codebase even doing so... it's nevertheless silly.

As for the bogus @static tag use in singleton classes for members

Most of the logic that was previously in InlineExamples controller is
now moved away to the components.  The controller only deals with the
high-level stuff like initializing the components when page loaded.

From look-and-feel side the editor component now has rounded corners
and looks almost like the normal <pre> code block.  When switching

The choice of names is currently misfortunate.  It would be logical
to use ""alias"", but we already have @alias which does a completely
different thing.  This issue has been disturbing us for long, but
now it really starts to hurt.  I feel we have to reclame @alias

template.html but contains only bare minumum of JavaScript links

The purpose of all this is to run the :compress before building
gem for release version of JSDuck.  For this reason we also don't
concatenate data.js with app.js, as the jsduck gem wants to generate
its own data.js.

To make this performance-boost work, some restructuring was required:

- Parser now includes DocParser, returning the doc-blocks
  in fully parsed form.

- Aggregator no more includes Parser.  Instead of parse() method
  it now has aggregate(), which expects output of Parser as input.
  Because of this some changes to unit tests were also needed.

- App performs the parallel parsing of source code and then
  feeds the results of parsing sequencially to Aggregator.

- Timing now reports three measures: parsing, aggregating, generating.
  But because of the parallel-phase, the report of parsing isn't
  that accurate as it also includes the generation of code files."
