Remove help wanted text from README

Despite some great work done in the last couple of months, nobody showed a strong motivation to take over this project.

I want to thank @hkdobrev for his hard work as he helped me lot in closing issues and fixing bugs. Silex is now compatible with Symfony 4 and that's going to help a lot in migrating projects.

I still strongly believe that Symfony 4 is a better alternative and that there is nothing unique anymore in Silex.

Forking is still an option if someone wants to take over of course.

Let's make it much simpler to maintain future versions of Silex. This pull request does the following (@Ocramius would be proud of me :)):

 * drop support for Twig < 2.0
 * drop support for PHP < 7.1
 * drop support for Symfony 2.x and 3.x

I'd like to update the security.rst as I found the lack of information about the security context sharing between multiple firewalls. I know a lot of people are having problems not knowing this, so it would be nice to mention it. Please, check the correctness and approve it if you find it useful. Thanks.

This PR was merged into the 2.2.x-dev branch.

Namespaces for Twig paths

Hello,

Recently, I had to use Symfony project's pieces of code in a Silex project, extending parent templates through submodules. These submodules, on which I had no control, used namespaced templates in their Twig files, such as:
```twig
{% import ""@FooModule/macros.html.twig"" as macros %}
```

____

### Problem
Silex cannot resolve namespaces by default, since you have to register paths as following:
```php
$app->register(new TwigServiceProvider(), array(
    'twig.path' => [
        '../app/Resources/views',
        '../common/foo-module/Resources/views'
    ]
));
```

### Temporary solution
What I had to do in order to get it working in the project was to ""hack"" the `\Twig_Loader_Filesystem` class (*PHP 7+*):
```php
$paths = [
    '../app/Resources/views',
    'FooModule' => '../common/foo-module/Resources/views',
];
$app->register(new TwigServiceProvider());
$app['twig.loader.filesystem'] = (function() use (&$paths): \Twig_Loader_Filesystem {
    $fileSystem = new \Twig_Loader_Filesystem();
    foreach ($paths as $namespace => $path) {
        if (is_string($namespace)) {
            $fileSystem->addPath($path, $namespace);
        } else {
            $fileSystem->addPath($path);
        }
    }

     return $fileSystem;
})();
```
This works fine. Other solutions crossed my minds, but this was one of the best alternatives I figured in order to use Twig namespaces in Silex.

### Code modification
Though this solution works, it may seem a bit dirty to have to do this in the project's code and not having the `TwigServiceProvider` providing this possibility. So I added this little piece of algorithm directly at the `\Twig_Loader_Filesystem` instanciation, which now looks like this as you will see in changes:
```php
$app['twig.loader.filesystem'] = function ($app) {
    if (!is_array($app['twig.path'])) {
        $app['twig.path'] = array($app['twig.path']);
    }

    $fileSystem = new \Twig_Loader_Filesystem();
    foreach ($app['twig.path'] as $namespace => $path) {
        if (is_string($namespace)) {
            $fileSystem->addPath($path, $namespace);
        } else {
            $fileSystem->addPath($path);
        }
    }

    return $fileSystem;
};
```
So you can simply register your `TwigServiceProvider` as following:
```php
$app->register(new TwigServiceProvider(), [
    'twig.path' => [
        '../app/Resources/views',
        'FooModule' => '../common/foo-module/Resources/views',
    ]
]);
```

___

English not being my native language, I hope I was clear enough. I stay around to answer any question about this potential contribution. (:

1. `Silex\ControllerResolver` [is not used by Silex](https://github.com/silexphp/Silex/blob/master/src/Silex/Provider/HttpKernelServiceProvider.php#L37) when using HttpKernel >= 3.1.0, so I skipped the only test present in `ControllerResolverTest` with recent versions, as it failed when testing against HttpKernel v4  (master).

2. `ServiceControllerResolverTest::testShouldDelegateGetArguments()` only asserts that the deprecated method is called, so added a `@group legacy` to handle the notice, and skipped the test with v4 to prevent a warning (PHPUnit complains when you mock a non-existent method).

Fixed translator.resources definition

`translator.resource` is wrongly registered as a protected closure in `TranslationServiceProvider` (it was originally added correctly in dd27038, but changed in 48a3fdc).

That makes a test fail with Pimple 3.2.1 due to the silexphp/Pimple#190 fix as `translator.resource` can't be extended.

RedirectableUrlMatcher needs to return a proper array with the _route parameter

Symfony's HttpUtils's checkRequestPath() expects RedirectableUrlMatcher to return an array with '_route'. This throws a notice `Undefined index: _route`:

```
        $coll = new RouteCollection();
        $coll->add('foo', new Route('/foo', array(), array(), array(), '', array('https')));
        $matcher = new RedirectableUrlMatcher($coll, new RequestContext());
        $httpUtils = new HttpUtils(null, $matcher);
        $request = Request::create('http://example.com/foo');
        $httpUtils->checkRequestPath($request, 'foo');
```

It's an issue with my app although I haven't yet taken the time to make a simplified app to show the issue besides the above.

Test all the 3.x branches in Travis

I enhanced the Travis config to ensure the tests are run against all the available 3.x branches.

Before the changes:
- The tests were run against `2.8` when `$SYMFONY_DEPS_VERSION` was unset
- There were additional envs for `3.0`, `3.1` and `3.2`

After the changes:
- When `$SYMFONY_DEPS_VERSION` is unset, `composer.json` is left unchanged and the tests are run against the most recent `3.x-dev` branch (what you'd get by running phpunit locally)
- There are envs to test all the symfony branches from `2.8` to `3.3`

I also fixed the cache (there were two `cache/directories` sections) and made the syntax more consistent overall.

This changes the behaviors of the build: before, `Twig 2.x` was tested with `2.8`. Now, it is tested alongside the most recent `3.x`. I believe it makes more sense like this, however if the old behavior was on purpose (i.e because `2.8` is still the most recent _lts_), I can still switch back and add envs for `3.3` and `3.4` instead.

Regarding the changes to the tests:

I originally removed `symfony/web-link` from the list of dependencies when testing against `< 3.3`, as something like this will be necessary later when adding `symfony/cache` support which conflicts with `symfony/var-dumper < 3.3`.

However, as this was not necessary and actually prevented us to check that the WebLink integration didn't break when the component was available but associated with an old version of the `twig-bridge`, I ultimately rolled back the change. Yet, I kept the checks in the tests as they are cleaner this way IMO (anyway they're in a separate commit so I could just remove them too if you want).

Fixed WebTestCase compatibility with PHPUnit 6+

Makes `WebTestCase` inherit from `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase` instead of `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase`.

Strictly speaking it's a BC break, but as the namespaced class is now available in PHPUnit 4.8.35, 5.4+ and 6.x it's probable safe.

Added WebLink component integration

I made the necessary changes to support the new WebLink component:

- `HttpKernelServiceProvider` registers the `AddLinkHeaderListener` if the component is available
- `TwigServiceProvider` adds the `WebLinkExtension` if the component and the Twig bridge are available
- Both changes are tested
- The documentation has been amended (the link to the Symfony website doesn't work as 3.3 hasn't been released yet but I believe it's the good URL)

Fix AssetServiceProviderTest::testGenerateAssetUrl

The test broke when symfony/symfony#22528 got merged.

I added one check without the starting slash (the returned path should be relative to `base_path`) and modified the expectation of the check with the starting slash (the returned path should not be relative).

```
There was 1 failure:

Discussion
----------

Use the simple-phpunit script in Travis and add PHP 7.1

This will fix the Travis build issues with PHP 7.

I upped the `symfony/phpunit-bridge` version requirement so we can use the `simple-phpunit` script that was added in 3.2.0, and updated the `script` config value.

While I was at it, I also added PHP 7.1 to the matrix (hopefully it's ok to do this in the same PR).

Hi all!

I've made a few minor changes to the docs ~to get those back into shape.
However I could use help finishing the `routing.rst`, this describes the `RoutingServiceProvider`.
The provider is powerful and awesome, but I struggle getting any good copy in there.
So if you have time please help out :)~

This PR was merged into the 2.0.x-dev branch.

Discussion
----------

Move setting $app['twig.app_variable'] after 'Symfony\Bridge\Twig' check

Currently `TwigServiceProvider ` sets `$app['twig.app_variable']` to be function that has a dependency on classes that are not required by Silex. This will fail if the user then calls that function. This happens for example when the [silex-pimple-dumper](https://github.com/Sorien/silex-pimple-dumper) maps over the app and tries to dump it's content.

This PR fixes that by moving this in the `class_exists('Symfony\Bridge\Twig\Extension\RoutingExtension')` check.

I've also added comment because at first it wasn't clear for me that this check for the `RoutingExtension` was the check for the whole Twig bridge. Please feel free to rebase and remove it it you don't like it or I misinterpreted it.

Keep up the good work! 👍

This PR was merged into the 2.0.x-dev branch.

Discussion
----------

Adding a flag to disable the Monolog error handler

The monolog error handler can now be disabled by setting the value of the new `monolog.use_error_handler` parameter to false (since it was added in  a53ce5902983493c53eea61f6cf1e304c0aa6409 it was always enabled).

The error handler is disabled by default when the application `debug` parameter is set to true, to ensure it won't silence exceptions and/or errors.

Without the flag, an uncaught exception thrown during boot on `master` will just result in a white page, even when using `debug` and `error_reporting` (because the error handler calls `exit` after logging exceptions).

This PR was squashed before being merged into the 2.0.x-dev branch (closes #1330).

Discussion
----------

Add the possibility to register forms as services

This allows you to register your form types / form types extensions / form types guessers as Silex services:
```php
    $app['your.type.service'] = function ($app) {
        return new YourServiceFormType();
    };
    $app->extend('form.types', function ($types) use ($app) {
        $types[] = 'your.type.service';
        return $types;
    }));
    ...
    $builder = $app['form.factory']->createBuilder('your.type.service');
```
This is particularly useful for users of Symfony 3.x, now that `FormFactory::createBuilder()` and friends don't allow you to pass an instance of `FormTypeInterface` anymore, preventing you from loading form types that require constructor arguments lazily (without the patch you have to add objects to the `form.types` / `form.type.extensions` / `form.type.guessers` parameters which means every single form of your application will have to get instantiated whenever you use the form component).

The patch contains a new `SilexFormExtension` extension class that handles the dereferencing of services names / lazy loading, new tests, and documentation fixes.

Other quick notes:
* No type checking is performed by the extension, but that's consistent with the way the `FormServiceProvider` works without the patch. Nevertheless, I believe this should be enhanced and will be ready to work on this after the merge if you reckon that would be a good idea.
* I had to change the `DummyFormType` declaration in the tests. You used a class with a `getName()` method with Symfony < 2.8 and one without the method with 2.8+. Now the problem is that the `FormRegistry` from 2.8.x still uses the `getName()` method to store form types, which means it is still needed in some cases. Thus for my tests to pass I had to make sure the class with `getName()` was used with any 2.x version while the one without it was only used with 3.x

add a namedForm() method in FormTrait

Just add the `$this['form.factory']->createNamedBuilder(...)` in `Silex\Application\FormTrait`:

```php

     * @param array                    $options Options for the form
     * @param string|FormTypeInterface $type    Type of the form
     *
     * @return \Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilder
     */
    public function namedForm($name, $data = null, array $options = array(), $type = null)
    {
        if (null === $type) {
            // BC with Symfony < 2.8
            $type = class_exists('Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\RangeType') ? 'Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\FormType' : 'form';

        return $this['form.factory']->createNamedBuilder($name, $type, $data, $options);

Added support for callables in CallbackResolver

Added the ability for the callback resolver to support any callable instead
of just the object and method callable type.

An alternate implementation to this would be to update the CallbackResolver to use an interface, then keep the old CallbackResolver as is and just add a new implementation that you can change if you'd like. I'd probably prefer to do the interface, but depends on what people think.

This fixes #1327

s/middlewares/middleware

Feel free to discard this PR,
but reading 'Middlewares' with an 's' feels jarring to me,
I never saw it written this way before.

For uses without the 's' see :
http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/257120/middleware-vs-middlewares
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware
http://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware.html

I did find uses of 'middlewares' in these pages, so, again, feel free to discard :
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_on_rack.html
https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/understanding-rack-apps-and-middleware

But for example it appears just twice with an 's' in this stack overflow page, and many more times without the 's' :

Services configuration are extracted from the SecurityBundle [`guard.xml`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.0/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/Resources/config/guard.xml) and [`GuardAuthenticationFactory`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.0/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/DependencyInjection/Security/Factory/GuardAuthenticationFactory.php)

Usage is quite simple, the `guard` type can be configured in the firewall like other ones.

```php
$app['app.authenticator'] = function ($app) {
    return new Authenticator();
};

$app->register(new Silex\Provider\SecurityServiceProvider(), [
    'security.firewalls' => [
        'main' => [
            'pattern' => '^/admin',
            'guard' => [

Replace binary gender examples with something that is actually single-choice

In order to include people who do not fit into the gender binary, gender fields really should be a free-form text field. As such, this patch changes the `choices` example to use a billing plan instead.

Add hint to install browser-kit to use WebTestCase

`Silex/WebTestCase` have a requirement for `symfony/browser-kit`.
This PR give instructions to the developer when PHPUnit is run and this dependency is missing.

```

After:
```
There was 1 error:

Remove mandatory dependency on request_stack and some monolog improvements

This lets everything work with Silex which lacks a request_stack, and I also made a couple changes to the monolog bootstrapping so it's easier to just override the monolog.handler OR monolog.handlers, before you kinda had to redefine both to customize anything.

I also moved the monolog.handler.debug out of the GroupHandler which makes more sense I think because if it is in the group then it falls under the not_found_activation_strategy and therefore even in debug mode you won't get any logs unless you get an error-level record.

This PR was squashed before being merged into the 2.0.x-dev branch (closes #1224).

Discussion
----------

Move Services into ServiceProvider

Some time ago we added KernelServiceProvider and RoutingServiceProvider. I have taken the rest of the services defined directly in the Silex\Application class and moved them into those two service providers.

This makes Application more of a delegation class.

Discussion
----------

Allowing the use of both objects and arrays for the register()

Sometimes we may like to use objects for lazy loading and whatsoever and since PHP has the Traversable interface, that should be perfectly fine.

Discussion

Change closures to use $app as the first parameter.

Almost always the first parameter is $app therefor it makes little sense
to use `use` part of the closure and having PHP do context switching all
over the place.

This also makes it explicit in the service providers exactly what $app
instance is used.

This PR was merged into the 2.0.x-dev branch.

Discussion
----------

Added factory for RouteCollection, makes subclassing of RouteCollection possible.

Note: replaces #1174, which was targeting a wrong branch (and where I messed a bit with the commits ;)).

--

The aim of this PR is to allow developpers to subclass `Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection` to change some of its behavior.

In most of my Silex apps, I figured I don't want the Symfony's `RouteCollection` regular behavior where if you define two routes with the same name (bad copy-paste for instance), the first route added simply gets overriden by the second. Instead, I would like to be able to throw an Exception if that happens. So I've written [a tiny subclass of RouteCollection](https://github.com/lschricke/symfony-strict-route-collection), but to be able to use it (through [a service provider like this](https://github.com/lschricke/silex-strict-route-collection-service-provider) for instance (needs to be updated for Silex 2)), I need to be able to replace `RouteCollection` by my subclass. This PR makes it possible.

Thanks! :)

refactored the session provider

replaces #934 by making possible to override the default bags, but more importantly, it removes the storage definition from the inside of the session one to the outside.

This PR was merged into the 1.3 branch.

Discussion
----------

Easier user access

In Silex 1.3, it's ""harder"" to get the user from the security layer as the `security` service has been deprecated. The code is already available in the security trait, but if you are not using it, you need to use a somewhat ""complex"" expression in templates to access it (see #1152)

This PR moves the code from the trait to the security service to make it available to everyone.

One question though: can we deprecate the trait `user()` function? It is not useful anymore after this PR.

This PR was merged into the 1.2 branch.

Discussion
----------

Changed Doctrine page to use utf8mb4 as sample

MySQL's `utf8` character set is a little broken, and does not cover 4-byte UTF-8 characters. In most cases it will quietly truncate the string whenever it sees one, saving incomplete text data.

In  5.5.3 they introduced `utf8mb4` to fix this inconsistency, and given that it's been 5 years, it's probably safe to encourage people to use it. If their MySQL installation is older, it should be easy for them to find the distinctive string and change it back to `utf8`, and for a new project.

Additional details can be found in the equivalent [pull-request for Symfony-2](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/5100).

This PR was submitted for the master branch but it was merged into the 1.3 branch instead (closes #1122).

Discussion
----------

Add OPTIONS request routing directly to Application

I think it's important to add this HTTP Method directly to the application because it's often called automatically by browsers during AJAX requests. Meaning it's required that anyone sending AJAX requests to Silex will have to implement some kind of OPTIONS handling. I realize that you can use the match and method calls to do this same thing but those make routing OPTIONS requests less obvious.

MySQL's `utf8` character set is a little broken, and does not cover 4-byte UTF-8 characters. In most cases it will quietly truncate the string whenever it sees one, saving incomplete text data.  

In  5.5.3 they introduced `utf8mb4` to fix this inconsistency, and given that it's been 5 years, it's probably safe to encourage people to use it. If their MySQL installation is old, it should be easy for them to find the distinctive string and change it back to `utf8`."

This PR was merged into the 1.3 branch.

Discussion
----------

Have `Controller::generateRouteName()` always put the method first.

(As requested, this is #1154 rebased against 1.3.)

At present, mounted controllers can get weird route names. For instance, let's say you have this controller definition:

    $otherController = $app['controllers_factory'];
    $otherController->get('/{name}', function (Request $request, $name) use ($app) {
      return new Response(""Goodbye $name!\n"", 200, ['Content-Type' => 'text/plain']);
      });
    $app->mount('/goodbye', $otherController);

The generated route name in this case will be `_goodbyeGET_name`, which technically contains everything, but is ugly.

With this PR, the route name will change to `GET_goodbye_name`, which is considerably easier to parse when debugging.

A solution to resolve #983 (bad comportment of Translator)

Implementation of @henrikbjorn solution :

Use the Translator directly from Symfony and create a EventListener that sets the Locale on the translator based on the request (like LocaleListener does).

Flush spool queue for console terminate as well

This allows to flush Swift messages automatically inside a Silex console application.

It basically does the same as the ``EmailSenderListener`` in Symfony's SwiftMailerBundle. (see https://github.com/symfony/SwiftmailerBundle/commit/4b90392463296acc9ccf8f10649d7ac4937ae0f3).

```php
use Symfony\Component\Console\Application;

$app = require __DIR__.'/app.php';

$console = new Application('My Silex Application', 'n/a');
$console->setDispatcher($app['dispatcher']);

// .. register commands that send emails

$console->run();
```

This PR was merged into the 2.0.x-dev branch.

Discussion
----------

Introduce KernelServiceProvider in order to remove ""hacks""

This introduces a new KernelServiceProvider that is auto registered
by Silex\Application.

The main reason for including this is to remove the ugly
""dispatcher_class"" hack we used to have. But since we introduced a
seperate interface for listeners to use for subscribing we can just have
a nice normal service.

This introduces a new KernelServiceProvider that is auto registered

The main reason for including this is to remove the ugly

a nice normal service."

allowed any Symfony 2.x versions for Silex 1.2

As we know that Symfony 3.0 will be next year, let's allow any Symfony 2.x versions. I've added the 2.6 and 2.7 versions in Travis to check that everything work fine for all supported Symfony 2.x versions.

Update session.rst

May be a bug, but Sessions expire after 30 minutes (or less ?)
To have the default behavior describe in documentation, you must set cookie_lifetime to 0

$app->register(new Silex\Provider\UrlGeneratorServiceProvider(), array(
    'session.storage.options' => array(
        'cookie_lifetime' => 0

Add $app parameter for application middlewares (before, after, finish)

There is small inconsistence between route and application middlewares.

Route middlewares (http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/middlewares.html#route-middlewares) can have $app parameter, but application middlewares (http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/middlewares.html#application-middlewares) has this parameter missing.

Fixed DoctrineServiceProvider when no logger

When the provider is used with `Pimple` alone, it throws an exception if the `logger` is not defined.

It was previously working, but it seems to be introduced in https://github.com/silexphp/Silex/commit/784a24665de285cb8c31db2c12c4785eb5605773.

Discussion
----------

remove not needed logger tests

The `isset` checks on `$app['logger']` make no sense since `Application` always sets the logger (to `null`). Checks for `!empty` would be more safe/complete (altough `!empty && instance_of('LoggerInterface')` would be more ideal in some cases).
Updating the unit tests is more complicated because some code under test depends on classes outside of Silex.
Hacking the `class_exists` function or use `mocking` of classes that do not exists (@see https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-mock-objects/issues/12) would effect the whole test suit (as @stof pointed out).

It wasn't clear to me the session needs to be there before you boot.
I 'wasted' a great amount of time finding that out.
Please clarify for upcoming geniuses like me.

Improve exception messages for mount()

Improve the exception message if the `connect` method of a `ControllerProviderInterface` returns an invalid type.

Previously a misleading message about the arguments to `mount()` was emitted if your `connect` method did not return a `ControllerCollection`.

Discussion
----------

Move master to 2.0

This PR moves master to 2.0@dev. As there is a 1.2 branch, that should not be a problem for anyone ... except if you target dev-master in your composer.json, but hey, that's your choice.

Of course, it's not finished yet, but working on master is easier for everyone and future PRs.

Discussion
----------

Replace Monolog middlewares by an event listener

This is an alternative to the changes introduced by #894 in order to allow replacement of the logging middlewares.
Instead of having a Closure for each listener, this PR introduces a listener class.
The listener can be used independently from the MonologServiceProvider.

Provides support for the PATCH method for HTTP

This pull request allows Silex routes to be specified to handle the `PATCH` method for HTTP. Without this, when trying to specify that a route accepts `PATCH` requests, Silex throws a `BadMethodCallException` with the message `Method ""Silex\Route::patch"" does not exist.`

Discussion
----------

Allow strings for levels in the monolog service provider

The monolog service provider requires a constant on Monolog\Logger to be
referenced, which has an integer value. This is not very practical when
working with external configuration files.

This patch accepts strings like debug, info, error, etc. that are
translated to the corresponding logger constant values.

This is an alternative to #882.

allowed any callback to be a method call on a service (a:b notation)

#800 added the possibility to use a service method (with the `a:b` notation) for converters. This PR goes one step further by allowing almost all methods accepting a callback to use a service method.

The following is now possible:

```php
$app->before('service:beforeApp');
$app->after('service:afterApp');
$app->finish('service:finishApp');
$app->error('service:error');
$app->on('kernel.request', 'service:onRequest');

$app
    ->match('/', 'service:controller')
    ->convert('foo', 'service:convert')
    ->before('service:before')
    ->after('service:after')
;
```

added a cookbook about managing assets

This was not documented before and as we get many PRs on adding more abstraction in Silex about assets (see #697 or #733), I wanted to demonstrate that everything is as easy as it can get without any further helper functions in Silex itself.

Discussion
----------

fixed translator locale management

The locale used by the translator was set the first time the translator was instantiated. That's a problem for several reasons:

 * changing the locale via `$app['locale']` would not change the locale used by the translator;

 * when using fragments, the locale was not updated correctly;

 * also, when using the web profiler, the translator is created early on (before the handling of a request), and so the locale was always `en` (see silexphp/Silex-WebProfiler#23).

Discussion
----------

Converters

This PR reverts #769 (which tried to fix #768) as this is a breaks BC for the most usual use case of converters (#806).

The decision has been taken (#814) that a converter always run, independently of the available request attribute names or controller argument names.

Because of the above, running the converters as a controller event is not needed anymore, and moving the converters earlier in the process gives more power to the developer (#825 and #826).

Converters as service

This PR decouples the callback resolution service from `ServiceControllerResolver` in `CallbackResolver` so it can be used to resolve converter callback declared a service callbacks :

```php
$app->get('/user/{user}', function (User $user) {
    // ...
})->convert('user', 'service:method');
```

Discussion
----------

added a way to delay the attachment of a controller to a route

There are several ideas behind this PR. It's mostly about consistency by being able to decouple the setting of a controller from the match call. The old way still works of course.

It is more consistent as everything can now be done via method calls and the fact that the controller is the second argument makes things uglier, especially when the code in the controller is large.

As an added bonus, it helps when indenting the code (currently, I always wonder how to indent my code as it's not obvious). Last, but not the least, being able to put the code last also makes things more readable.

Current:

```
$app->get('/foo', function ($id) {
    // ...
})
->bind('home')
->assert('id', '\d+')
;
```

Now:

```
$app
    ->get('/foo')
    ->bind('home')
    ->assert('id', '\d+')
    ->run(function ($id) {
        // ...
    })
;
```

By setting `NULL` as controller, the route will end in 404 error if it's not bypassed by a security listener.

Only convert attributes on the request that actually exist

Fixes #768.

Note: This could be considered a BC break, since it on longer implicitly creates attributes on the request. I'd consider it quite a minor break. The name `convert` implies that the attribute must be present, and I personally would  consider this a bug fix instead.

Enable compatibility and testing with Symfony 2.4

Hello,

Symfony 2.4 is scheduled for november then, according to Symfony release process, the stabilization phase should start in september.

I think it's a good idea to add Symfony 2.4 compatibility as it seems there's no breakage and some people would like to work on the 2.4 branch while working on Silex.

Lower the priority of the exception logging

Fixes #752

I'd like this to be lower, `Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\EventListener\ExceptionListener` has this functionality at [-128](https://github.com/webfactory/symfony/blob/6b64c03e4a92d071263b3c5c765de166106f2d2e/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/EventListener/ExceptionListener.php#L84), but the default priority for handlers added with `Silex\Application::error` fire at -8, so I thought there would be fewer wtfs if we stay above that?

Change the ControllerResolver type hint to Psr\\Log\\LoggerInterface

This allows it to work with any logger, in particular, it un-breaks the case where the monolog bridge is not installed.

See also 817240e40335092852186409dac64c13a494ec52. This should resolve #740.

Add note on how to handle fatal errors

I'm not so happy with this solution from a usability perspective, but I don't want to have global error handlers in silex itself.

An option we could consider is making symfony's ErrorHandler fall back to an internal ``ExceptionHandler`` for fatal errors. But obviously that is not very elegant either. Ideas welcome.

Alter app references in middleware doc

I use ControllerProvider's and functions for my controllers, and I rely on the ````Application```` and ````Request```` being injected via the parameters of each function. Today I happened to need to build some middleware, but found that ````public function before(Application $app)```` resulted in a fatal as the middleware does not use type hinting to set parameters like controllers do. On digging a bit deeper I found in ````Silex\EventListener\MiddlewareListener.php::onKernelRequest```` the following line:
````
$ret = call_user_func($callback, $request, $this->app);
````
This injects application as the second parameter. I'm really happy that it does do this, but the parameter order seems a little strange to me. It's a bit at odds with the rest of the documentation on controllers - the general method prototype is ````method(Application $app, Request $request)````. Given this, I would have expected the app to come first in the parameter list. The same applies to the after callback, except it has ````Response```` between ````Request```` and ````Application````.

The global middleware defined in ````Application```` do not inject the app in any of the callbacks, confusing the matter further. My pattern doesn't actually require this, but some people's might. Is there a reason this hasn't been done? It would be very simple to add, given the three methods are inside the ````Application```` class itself.

The ideal fix to this would be that the middleware use type hinting to apply the parameters, but this is complicated by the callbacks occurring in two classes, neither of which are local to the existing type hinting code. At the very least I think this functionality should be documented, so this is what I have provided in the PR.

Make dispatcher lazy, do not trigger its creation on middleware definition

The dispatcher has quite a few dependencies due to all of the subscribers
that are added to it. One of these is the logger, several other services
are affected as well though.

The listener shortcut methods like on(), before(), after(), error() all
force creation of the dispatcher and thus all of its dependencies. This
makes it impossible to have lazy configuration of those services.

The specific issue that triggered this was lazy configuration of the logger,
which simply does not work once you have before() or after().

By using extend(), all of those shortcut calls can delay the creation of
the dispatcher and thus solve the issue. It will add a slight overhead, but
it should be relatively small, since the results of creating a service are
memoized through share().

Ported ConstraintValidatorFactory.php to Silex

Included a modified version of `ConstraintValidatorFactory` to Silex for use with custom constraints.

Since Silex comes with `ValidatorServiceProvider` built in, I guess it makes sense to include this, in case users might want dependencies with their custom validators.

Usage would be:

```php
// Custom.php
public function validatedBy()
{
    return 'my.validator.custom';
}

// index.php
$app['validator.custom'] = $app->share(function ($app) {
    return new CustomValidator();
});
$app->register(new ValidatorServiceProvider(), array(
    'validator.validator_service_ids' => array(
        'my.validator.custom' => 'validator.custom'
    )
));
```

Added support for URL host from Routing Component

Hi everyone,

Firstly, I wanted to thank you all for Silex. It's fabulous.

I needed URL host support in Silex to manage different subdomains of my small application and came up with an idea of introducing `->host($host)` chained method to `Silex\Route` class. This way users can apply host resolution to controllers in Silex.

This PR includes above functionality + one unit test to check if everything works as expected.

URL host support is of course available in Routing Component from version `>=2.2`, but Silex relies on 2.2 anyway.

Example:
```php
<?php

// ...

$app->match('/', function() {
    // app-specific action
})->host('example.com');

$app->match('/', function ($user) {
    // user-specific action
})->host('{user}.example.com');

// ...
```

I am open for comments.

note that `mod_rewrite` needs to be enabled

If `mod_rewrite` isn't enabled - like in default Apache installs and WAMP - it will result in 404's. I had this issue with the hello world zip distribution (SO question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15498419/why-am-i-getting-these-silex-404s) and it was quite difficult to track down. Almost made me give up on Silex, although this is of course not a Silex issue - but it can be challenging for beginners, and if you can't get the hello world to run it kinda takes the wind out of your sails.

Include querystring parameters when issuing a redirect from RedirectableUrlMatcher

When a route has a scheme requirement (HTTP or HTTPS) and the current request's scheme does not match it, it issues a redirect to the required scheme. Prior to this change, the new URL being redirected to left off the querystring parameters.

It would be cleaner to set the QUERY_STRING parameter as part of RequestContext->fromRequest() but that's part of the Symfony core. Including it inside the $this['url_matcher'] closure keeps the change localized to Silex.

7c38c9a Add services allowing for form type extensions and guessers

Discussion
----------

Add services allowing for form type extensions and guessers

I don't like the empty `FormTypeGuesserChain`, but `PreloadedExtension` requires one to be passed until symfony/symfony#5479 gets merged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-11-24T11:54:08Z

symfony/symfony#5479 has been merged now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2012-11-25T19:59:41Z

So, do we want this documenting at this point? I'm glad to have removed the dummy TypeGuesser, but without it, people who don't have a 'dev' version of symfony/form, will need the workaround in their userland code, which may cause headaches.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2013-01-10T07:34:15Z

I think we need to switch to Symfony 2.2 in Silex now. What others think? @igorw

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2013-01-10T07:54:20Z

:+1: from me, though while we're on the topic, are there any plans to tag a 1.0?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2013-01-10T13:52:38Z

@fabpot Is there any reason why you would want to enforce users to use an unstable version?

I am against it for the following reasons:

* Users should be able to get stable versions if the stable versions work correctly.
* Silex already allows you to get 2.2, simply by lowering the `minimum-stability` to `beta`.
* Our current recommended way to install silex is `1.0.*@dev` (except on the download page, because it was not updated correctly when we changed it). This means that once they update it will blow up (due to `minimum-stability`), which will result in a lot of frustration, and a lot of support requests.

IMO we should encourage our users to try 2.2 by lowering their `minimum-stability`, but not enforce it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2013-01-10T13:55:34Z

another solution would be to bump the requirement to 2.2 only after releasing Silex.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2013-01-11T07:51:36Z

Silex has not reached 1.0 yet. So, switching to 2.2 seems logical to me. That being said, we can wait for 2.2 stable to be out if this is what you suggest.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2013-01-11T16:23:06Z

Bumping to 2.2 after it is stable sounds acceptable to me, but unless there is a specific change in 2.2 that silex *needs*, I still don't really see the point. Supporting 2.1+ is easy enough to do.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2013-03-06T13:28:19Z

So the current status with this PR, is that adding a TypeExtension with anything less than 2.1.4 of the symfony components will break, unless the user also adds an FormTypeGuesserChain to the guessers array. That is, the test `testFormServiceProviderWillLoadTypeExtensions` will fail with symfony/form < 2.1.4.

If we want to merge this in I guess we can:

* Document the whole feature, with a note/gotcha for Symfony <2.1.4
* Bump the minimum Symfony component versions to 2.1.4
* Just merge it anyway

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2013-03-06T14:13:38Z

bumping to 2.1.4 as minimum is fine IMO. I don't see why someone would want to use 2.1.0 explicitly instead of using the bufix releases for 2.1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2013-03-06T21:39:29Z

:+1: for bumping to 2.1.4+

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2013-03-06T22:08:37Z

In this particular case I'd say it's acceptable to bump to `2.1.4`.

In the future these kind of changes will need more consideration though, as they can cause BC issues when multiple branches of symfony are supported by silex.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2013-03-08T12:05:04Z

When we said bumping to 2.1.4, I thought we were talking about bumping for just the component that has problems with earlier Symfony version, not all of them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2013-03-08T12:14:06Z

I did that because I wasn't sure how to approach it, I'll have a think about it, but I'll probably need some guidance.

I guess we may have to fall back on documenting that we have a dependency on 2.1.4 version of the Form Component, because it's not actually required? Maybe that should be in `suggest`? I don't think suggest enforces version requirements, so it either needs to be in the suggest message, or in the docs?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2013-03-08T12:22:59Z

It should be in both. Specifically, the form service provider docs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2013-03-08T13:01:26Z

Changed the requirements bump and documented, do we need to have something more specific/wordy in the docs?

Only one thing, do we need to explicitly state to do this before the request is handled? No-brainer to us, but what about others?

Or should I say, how likely are people to try and do something like:

``` php

    Request::enableHttpMethodParameterOverride();
});

```

I've used a similar example to the reverse proxy tip which I hope would make the context clear. Not sure how else to word it without becoming unnecessarily verbose. Also I'm assuming that the setting is going to be rolled into core at some point as it has pretty big backwards compatibility implications.

fbffc2b Enable logger and stopwatch for Doctrine queries

Discussion
----------

Add logger and stopwatch for Doctrine queries

Add SQL queries to the logs using the DbalLogger of the DoctrineBridge.

In addition, if the WebprofilerServiceProvider is registered (stopwatch service set), the timeline show doctrine queries.

I'm wondering if the stopwatch service should be moved to Silex core.

Totally :+1: for moving it to silex.

Is there a use case for the ""stopwatch"" outside of the webprofiler ?

@GromNaN Yes, it you want to bench some code.

@fabpot please not it will only add cruft. i think it is a niche thing to use the Stopwatch component."

Removed Assert\minLength in doc

Changed to Assert\Length

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2013-02-05T00:10:22Z

For the record, this change is due to Assert\MinLength and MaxLength being deprecated in 2.1, in favour of Length.

As we still support 2.1 and 2.2, I would suggest to add a note to indicate the name of the constraint in 2.1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GromNaN at 2013-02-06T17:10:24Z

Nice feature :+1:

As the `->json` method creates a `JsonResponse`, for consistency the method that create a `BinaryFileResponse` should be named `->binaryFile`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by vicb at 2013-02-06T17:14:43Z

I deeply love consistency but I really can't be consistent with a method named `json` !

Thanky @igorw, I've fixed that.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not opposed to this, but if we add it for `register` we should also do it for `mount` imo.

Yes, for `mount` too... Do I add it ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2013-01-21T18:49:33Z

You can add it as a separate commit. If we decide that it is not needed for `mount`, you can rebase that commit out ;-)

Sample user insert snippet.

The execute_query command to insert users into a sample database doesn't work with postgres due to the use of database specific string escape quotes. Changed to use the doctrine insert command which is less DB specific and better illustrates the use of DBAL.

Discussion

Support 'security' and 'stateless' flags in security config

`'security' => false` will disable the firewall (for a particular area) even if there are listeners configured.

`'stateless' => true` will prevent `ContextListener` from getting registered.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2013-01-05T15:01:38Z

I'm not sure I understand what you'd use these flags for, perhaps some
documentation would be useful?

These are the same flags you can use in Symfony2. I guess `'security' => false` by itself isn't too useful, but you could hypothetically do something like:

```php
$app->register(new SecurityServiceProvider(), array(
    'security.firewalls' => array(
        'api' => array(
            'pattern' => '^/api',
            'stateless' => true,
            'security' => !$app['debug'],
            'oauth' => true
        )
    )
));
```

Which will (a) turn off oauth access token authentication when you're debugging (b) turn off read/write on the session during authentication, which isn't wanted since the oauth access token is sent for each request.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2013-01-06T20:48:20Z

Sorry, I think I got confused by the security flag, I understand the stateless one.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2013-01-06T21:13:04Z

The goal of the ``security`` flag is to create a firewall pattern without firewall. The only reason for this is to whitelist a pattern by placing it before another pattern without having to create a crazy regex

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2013-01-18T15:00:19Z

Can you also update the documentation about these two new settings? Thanks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by gigablah at 2013-01-19T04:37:08Z

It's done. Added a section for Stateless Authentication, and a tip for the `security` flag."

Looks good to me. Since this is one of the common criticisms of silex from DI enthusiasts, maybe we should just support this feature out of the box.

@fabpot thoughts?

What's the benefit of using that technique over ControllerProviders ? some declouping can be made at the controller instanciation : like
```php
$app->mount(""/article"",new App\Controller\ArticleController($app['article_manager'],$app['user_manager']) );
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-10-17T18:08:41Z

@Mparaiso laziness: the services are only created if the controller gets called.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2012-10-18T22:31:13Z

@Mparaiso having been doing this for a couple of weeks now, I think the another benefit is the way I've been writing the controllers.

I like that my routes are decoupled from the controllers and, done right, the controllers can be completely framework agnostic. Frameworks should be an implementation detail. Previously, my feelings were that the best controllers, simply delegated to a service. Now my controllers are a service, and the routing does the delegating.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-11-04T16:57:20Z

@fabpot I would like to hear your opinion on adding controllers as services to core.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-11-05T07:36:46Z

Oops, when writing my previous comment, I mixed two PRs in my mind.

I'm in fact -1 for this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2012-11-05T09:22:55Z

I wouldn't push for this to be in core, I'd love it to be there for my own selfish reasons, but I understand it's not everyone's cup of tea.

Let's put any finishes on the cookbook and get it merged. Perhaps in time we may see more demand for it and then we can consider getting it in the core?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-11-05T13:10:36Z

Well, then let's not lose time arguing and just merge this into the docs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ChrisRiddell at 2012-11-06T10:07:21Z

I am all for this cookbook, I'll be using this for my next project, having a bit more structure as a full framework without a full framework is nice.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-11-06T10:41:17Z

There is no link between ""having a bit more structure"" and ""using controllers as services"". You can just create classes for your controllers without adding them to the service container.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ChrisRiddell at 2012-11-06T11:14:54Z

Okay had to read the requested cookbook a number of times but I sort understand now.

1) What's the major advantage in doing this?
2) so overriding the controller resolver only gives you better looking route defining?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2012-11-06T11:36:17Z

@ChrisRiddell it's a lot about personal preference. I prefer this as it promotes Dependency Injection over Service Location, which, without sounding like a dick, you can read about all over the web, I'd start with http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#ServiceLocatorVsDependencyInjection, then try the google.

:+1:

I was just asking about this tonight. I think this would be very useful to have *at least* as a cookbook entry. What reasons would there be to not add this to core? I'm curious to what sort of downsides there might be to allowing it.

As a point of reference, I'd like to present one of my earliest attempts to try and figure out how I wanted to use Silex and how supporting this out of the box could have changed my code.

Originally (currently) I had to duplicate the method signature for each of my controller actions:

```php
<?php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

/**
 * API App
 *
 * @author Beau Simensen <beau@dflydev.com>
 */
class Api extends AbstractApp
{
    const ROUTE_ROOT = 'my_api_root';
    const ROUTE_AUTH_ROOT = 'my_api_auth_root';
    const ROUTE_AUTH_AUTHENTICATE = 'my_api_auth_authenticate';
    const ROUTE_ROUTE_ROOT = 'my_api_route_root';
    const ROUTE_ROUTE_CREATE = 'my_api_route_create';
    const ROUTE_ROUTE_FIND = 'my_api_route_find';
    const ROUTE_ROUTE_DETAIL = 'my_api_route_detail';
    const ROUTE_SERVICE_ROOT = 'my_api_service_root';
    const ROUTE_SERVICE_CREATE = 'my_api_service_create';
    const ROUTE_SERVICE_FIND = 'my_api_service_find';
    const ROUTE_SERVICE_DETAIL = 'my_api_service_detail';

    protected function configure()
    {
        parent::configure();

        $app = $this;

        $app['my.api.controller.rootController'] = $app->share(function() use ($app) {
            return new Api\Controller\RootController($app);
        });

        $app['my.api.controller.authController'] = $app->share(function() use ($app) {
            return new Api\Controller\AuthController($app);
        });

        $app['my.api.controller.routeController'] = $app->share(function() use ($app) {
            return new Api\Controller\RouteController($app);
        });

        $app['my.api.controller.serviceController'] = $app->share(function() use ($app) {
            return new Api\Controller\ServiceController($app);
        });

        $app->get('/', function() use ($app) {
            return $app['my.api.controller.rootController']->rootAction();
        })->bind(self::ROUTE_ROOT);

        $app->get('/auth', function() use ($app) {
            return $app['my.api.controller.authController']->rootAction();
        })->bind(self::ROUTE_AUTH_ROOT);

        $app->post('/auth/authenticate', function(Request $request) use ($app) {
            return $app['my.api.controller.authController']->authenticateAction($request);
        })->bind(self::ROUTE_AUTH_AUTHENTICATE);

        $app->get('/route', function() use ($app) {
            return $app['my.api.controller.routeController']->rootAction();
        })->bind(self::ROUTE_ROUTE_ROOT);

        $app->post('/route/routes', function(Request $request) use ($app) {
            return $app['my.api.controller.routeController']->createAction($request);
        })->bind(self::ROUTE_ROUTE_CREATE);

        $app->post('/route/find', function(Request $request) use ($app) {
            return $app['my.api.controller.routeController']->findAction($request);
        })->bind(self::ROUTE_ROUTE_FIND);

        $app->get('/route/routes/{routeId}', function(Request $request, $routeId) use ($app) {
            return $app['my.api.controller.routeController']->detailAction($request, $routeId);
        })->bind(self::ROUTE_ROUTE_DETAIL);

        $app->get('/service', function(Request $request) use ($app) {
            return $app['my.api.controller.serviceController']->rootAction($request);
        })->bind(self::ROUTE_SERVICE_ROOT);

        $app->post('/service/services', function(Request $request, $serviceKey) use ($app) {
            return $app['my.api.controller.serviceController']->createAction($request, $serviceKey);
        })->bind(self::ROUTE_SERVICE_CREATE);

        $app->post('/service/find', function(Request $request) use ($app) {
            return $app['my.api.controller.serviceController']->findAction($request);
        })->bind(self::ROUTE_SERVICE_FIND);

        $app->get('/service/services/{serviceKey}', function(Request $request, $serviceKey) use ($app) {
            return $app['my.api.controller.serviceController']->detailAction($request, $serviceKey);
        })->bind(self::ROUTE_SERVICE_DETAIL);
    }
}
```

Using controllers as a service correctly, I can cut the amount of times I define my method signature in half and it looks more readable:

```php
<?php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

/**
 * API App
 *
 * @author Beau Simensen <beau@dflydev.com>
 */
class Api extends AbstractApp
{
    const ROUTE_ROOT = 'my_api_root';
    const ROUTE_AUTH_ROOT = 'my_api_auth_root';
    const ROUTE_AUTH_AUTHENTICATE = 'my_api_auth_authenticate';
    const ROUTE_ROUTE_ROOT = 'my_api_route_root';
    const ROUTE_ROUTE_CREATE = 'my_api_route_create';
    const ROUTE_ROUTE_FIND = 'my_api_route_find';
    const ROUTE_ROUTE_DETAIL = 'my_api_route_detail';
    const ROUTE_SERVICE_ROOT = 'my_api_service_root';
    const ROUTE_SERVICE_CREATE = 'my_api_service_create';
    const ROUTE_SERVICE_FIND = 'my_api_service_find';
    const ROUTE_SERVICE_DETAIL = 'my_api_service_detail';

    protected function configure()
    {
        parent::configure();

        $app = $this;

        $app['my.api.controller.rootController'] = $app->share(function() use ($app) {
            return new Api\Controller\RootController($app);
        });

        $app['my.api.controller.authController'] = $app->share(function() use ($app) {
            return new Api\Controller\AuthController($app);
        });

        $app['my.api.controller.routeController'] = $app->share(function() use ($app) {
            return new Api\Controller\RouteController($app);
        });

        $app['my.api.controller.serviceController'] = $app->share(function() use ($app) {
            return new Api\Controller\ServiceController($app);
        });

        $app->get('/', 'my.api.controller.rootController:rootAction')->bind(self::ROUTE_ROOT);

        $app->get('/auth', 'my.api.controller.authController:rootAction')
            ->bind(self::ROUTE_AUTH_ROOT);

        $app->post('/auth/authenticate', 'my.api.controller.authController:authenticateAction')
            ->bind(self::ROUTE_AUTH_AUTHENTICATE);

        $app->get('/route', 'my.api.controller.routeController:rootAction')
            ->bind(self::ROUTE_ROUTE_ROOT);

        $app->post('/route/routes', 'my.api.controller.routeController:createAction')
            ->bind(self::ROUTE_ROUTE_CREATE);

        $app->post('/route/find', 'my.api.controller.routeController:findAction')
            ->bind(self::ROUTE_ROUTE_FIND);

        $app->get('/route/routes/{routeId}', 'my.api.controller.routeController:detailAction')
            ->bind(self::ROUTE_ROUTE_DETAIL);

        $app->get('/service', 'my.api.controller.serviceController:rootAction')
            ->bind(self::ROUTE_SERVICE_ROOT);

        $app->post('/service/services', 'my.api.controller.serviceController:createAction')
            ->bind(self::ROUTE_SERVICE_CREATE);

        $app->post('/service/find', 'my.api.controller.serviceController:findAction')
            ->bind(self::ROUTE_SERVICE_FIND);

        $app->get('/service/services/{serviceKey}', 'my.api.controller.serviceController:detailAction')
            ->bind(self::ROUTE_SERVICE_DETAIL);
    }
}
```

In any event, this is a great extension. :) Whether it ends up in core or not I'll need to add this to my toolbox.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by spantaleev at 2012-11-09T08:58:46Z

To move my ""controllers"" to methods on an object, I've been instantiating the controller object and registering the routes like this:

    $controller = new NewsController($app);

    $collection->get('/index', array($controller, 'indexAction'))->bind('news.index');
    $collection->get('/view/{id}', array($controller, 'viewAction'))->bind('news.view');

This way, at least I don't have to define the method signatures twice and pass around the arguments manually, as @simensen originally did.

It does have some overhead, because the controller object needs to be created. It also looks a bit ugly passing the callbacks like that.

Seems like the ""controller.service:action"" method is cleaner and flexible enough to allow injecting the whole container or the individual controller dependencies. With my way of doing things (above), I can't afford to inject individual dependencies into the controller class even if I wanted to (because all controller objects in the app are always created, which will lead to a lot of unnecessary services being created as well).

It would be nice to have something standard like this in core, instead of having everyone override the controller resolver or use their own ugly way around the problem. I can see how going the ""class controllers"" route can complicate things though - it could lead to talks about adding a ContainerAware base controller class, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ChrisRiddell at 2012-11-09T10:12:46Z

@simensen I am very interested in how you setup your project like that, If your configure is protected i am assuming you extend each AbstractApp with Silex and run the configure method.

I am asking this as the way you have setup Silex by the look of things is very clean, I start playing around with using Controllers and it got messy fast.

On Topic:

I think something like this as core, would be as it gives you the option of using controller classes or route callbacks, But keep it simple by not going down the path of ContainerAware etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-11-09T23:37:47Z

@ChrisRiddell I encourage you to read https://igor.io/2012/11/09/scaling-silex.html

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by simensen at 2012-12-13T12:44:38Z

@fabpot What reasons do you have for being :-1: on this? I'm curious as to what sort of downsides you see.

I'm :+1: on having this just be a part of Silex and not requiring people to use an optional decorator or copy and paste cookbook code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2013-01-04T01:50:52Z

@fabpot that last commit moved to a composition based solution, do you think we could get this in now?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by simensen at 2013-01-04T02:28:57Z

:+1:

I'm still curious to know what kind of downsides there are to having Silex do this natively but if it has to be a cookbook entry to get the word out I'm all for it going in as-is. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2013-01-06T14:27:39Z

@fabpot can you please re-review this? IMO it would be a valuable addition to the docs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2013-01-07T11:00:15Z

I'm back! I really like the new implementation that uses composition. Thanks @davedevelopment. After thinking about this topic a lot during my holidays, here are my new thoughts (new year, new thoughts ;)):

* As the new implementation is quite straightforward, I'm +1 for moving the code to Silex core (the cookbook can just mention how to enable it then).

* The cookbook should IMO emphasise one of the big benefit (already mentioned above): creating controllers that are framework agnostic. At first, it does not seem like a big deal, but when you want to publish some code that needs to be reused, it becomes crucial. I worked on a project a few days ago and I was able to create controllers that are compatible with Symfony (full-stack), Silex, and Drupal; that's a big deal!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by davedevelopment at 2013-01-07T11:26:44Z

Awesome, this has made my morning.

I'll write another PR, with the decorator and some tests, then modify this PR to emphasise the major benefits (especially the framework agnostic part) and explain how to enable the decorator.

The parent constructor should probably be called at the end, that allows parameters to override the default services. And you should add a test case for that too.

@igorw The parent constructor replaces everything, so it cannot be called at the end.

[docs] Add charset documentation in doctrine provider

This PR refers to https://github.com/fabpot/Silex/issues/549 and adds documentation on how to setup charset when connecting to mysql

I've also edited the mysql example so that it is even more clear

And last but not least, I've upgraded links to doctrine documentation so that it points to their latest version

55dce6b Test session service provider with routes that does not use session

Discussion

Test session service provider with routes that does not use session

Hello,

Since symfony/Symfony@098b593591, a bug occurs with `SessionServiceProvider` :

When using `HttpKernel\Client`, setting `$app['session.test'] = true;` and querying the application multiple routes in a single unit test, a `RuntimeException` is thrown by `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Session\Storage\MockFileSessionStorage`.

For instance :

```php
use Silex\WebTestCase;
use Silex\Application;
use Silex\Provider\SessionServiceProvider;

class unitTest extends WebTestCase
{
    public function testUn()
    {
        $client = $this->createClient();
        $client->request('GET', '/');
        $client->request('GET', '/');
    }

    public function createApplication()
    {
        $app = new Application();

        $app->register(new SessionServiceProvider(), array(
            'session.test' => true
        ));

        $app['debug'] = true;
        $app['exception_handler']->disable();

        $app->get('/', function(Application $app) {
            return 'BOOM';
        });

        return $app;
    }
}
```
results in
```
1) unitTest::testUn
RuntimeException: Trying to save a session that was not started yet or was already closed

Of course, this test currently passes as the bug happens with latest `2.1.x-dev` source whereas `composer.json` settings ask to install latest stable tag.

This PR adds a test that fails with latest symfony 2.1.x.

Yes. If you set the `session.test` parameter to true, it will use a `MockFileSessionStorage` instead. See also [the SessionServiceProvider docs](silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/session.html)."

I agree, it should also be adjusted in the usage doc (which is currently broken because it has neither `minimum-stability` nor `@dev`).

[WIP] Events refactoring

This PR tries to address the issues reported on the `before()` method and more generally, the issues we have with the way we manage events in Silex.

Silex has special events (defined in SilexEvents), and they map with Symfony events. For instance, the `BEFORE` event maps to the `REQUEST` one from Symfony. The main difference is that the priority you set for a `BEFORE` event can only configure the priority compared to other `BEFORE` events; all the events for the `BEFORE` event are dispatched from a single priority on the `REQUEST` event. This behavior removes a lot of flexibility for no reasons. And the same goes for the other Silex events.

So, this PR does is to remove the specific Silex events and replace them with regular Symfony ones. This gives you more flexibility. For instance, it means that now, you can use the `before()` method to do something before the routing (priority `Application::EARLY_EVENT`) or after it (`Application::LATE_EVENT`). And if you really need to do something after the routing and before the security, that's also possible.

The biggest benefit is that with the `before()`, `after()`, `error()`, and `finish()' methods, you can pretty much change all the default Symfony behaviors. So, adding a listener directly to the dispatcher should be now pretty rare.

This PR is not finished yet as the documentation is not updated (but with the added flexibility, it's going to be much easier to document exactly what you can do and how in a consistent manner), but I want to gather feedback on the philosophy first.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-11-03T07:56:18Z

I forgot to mention that this breaks BC, but only for edge cases (and this will be documented of course).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-11-04T04:34:56Z

I am generally :+1: for this change.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-11-04T07:55:04Z

I've added two commits that fix two other issues:

* ca79d33: all subscribers are now registered during the creation of the dispatcher (the exception handler is not a special case anymore)
* 3108bfa: to avoid any problem with the local management, it is now handled in a proper listener that extends the Symfony one.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-11-04T08:20:36Z

Another commit (f51a1f2) that moves the middleware management to an event listener (one less ugly hack).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-11-04T08:24:19Z

At this point, I want your feedback again about another possible move I'm not sure about.

Now that this PR introduces two event listener classes (`LocaleListener` and `MiddlewareListener`), what about creating two additional ones: one for the controller arguments converter and another one for the StringToResponse handling.

Moving them to proper listeners makes things more consistent (and everything would be registered in the dispatcher creation closure) and more customisable (not sure you ever need to modify the default behavior though).

What do you think?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-11-04T08:45:07Z

I've just pushed a commit that implements my previous proposal (09a6104).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-11-04T15:14:53Z

:+1: moving all of the subscribers out of the application class helps a lot to clean things up.

* `before` and `after` should be more consistent with the `HttpKernelInterface::MASTER_REQUEST` check.
* `error` is still a bit of a mess, if possible I'd move that to a separate class as well.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-11-04T15:40:41Z

@igorw: The code in the error method has been moved to its own class (see 77a1878).

What do you mean about the consistency of the master request check?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-11-04T15:51:29Z

Error refactoring looks good.

The master request check should be return-early in both cases."

Log a little more information about exceptions

This takes a little from Symfony's ExceptionListener, logging a little more appropriate information. Without this code, 404's etc are logged with a blank message.

Discussion
----------

Updated doc/providers/form.rst

Hello,

Only one line changed. FormTrait adds ```function form($data, $options)``` to \Silex\Application, not ```form($name, $data, $options)``` like createBuilder; this example in docs was throwing exception.

(this is my first pull request and now I see I should have done it in separate branch; sorry. I hope I didn't broke anything)

Add a SerializerServiceProvider

```php
<?php

use Silex\Application;
use Silex\Provider\SerializerServiceProvider;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

$app = new Application();

$app->register(new SerializerServiceProvider);

// only accept content types supported by the serializer via the assert method.
$app->get(""/pages/{id}.{_format}"", function ($id) use ($app) {
    // assume a page_repository service exists that returns Page objects. The
    // object returned has getters and setters exposing the state.
    $page = $app['page_repository']->find($id);
    $format = $app['request']->getFormat();

    if (!$page instanceof Page) {
        $this->abort(""No page found for id: $id"");
    }

    return new Response($app['serializer']->serialize($page, $format), 200, array(

I think it makes sense to have this in core.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by marijn at 2012-06-28T14:41:03Z

Ok. Haven't tested in ""in the wild"" yet (working on that as we speak). Any pointers, concerns or other comments are more than welcome :smile:

Should I add more documentation or is this enough?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-06-28T14:47:03Z

@fabpot I agree. :+1:

Please add some more tests.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by marijn at 2012-06-28T14:50:13Z

@igorw in regards to the tests: what would you like to see added? I figured we should only test if the serializer is configured properly, not if it actually serializes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-06-28T15:11:06Z

You're right, no need to test serialization. Looks good. :+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by marijn at 2012-06-28T16:02:20Z

Somehow I have trouble running the full test suite. The swift mailer configuration doesn't seem to work. Is this a known issue?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GromNaN at 2012-06-28T20:33:14Z

A new trait can also be added with the method `serialize()`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by marijn at 2012-06-28T21:34:58Z

At the moment I haven't got a working version of PHP 5.4 so I cannot test traits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by marijn at 2012-06-29T19:01:21Z

It seems to me that adding a `trait` for the serializer doesn't really make any sense: the API for the `Serializer` component is pretty extensive, it would add a lot of methods to the `Application`. What do you think?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-06-30T10:32:07Z

@marijn the trait would cover the simple use of the serializer, i.e. a ``serialize()`` method. It is not intended to cover all possible use cases.

What is status of this PR? Is it going to be merged?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by marijn at 2012-10-27T21:14:12Z

I have no clue, @alanbem. If you're in need of a serializer for Silex you can either merge this in your own fork of Silex or use the [`jms/serializer-service-provider`][1] that I released.

6d3e410 Use $app['db'] instead of $conn and add autoinc

Discussion
----------

Use $app['db’] instead of $conn and add an auto increment

`$conn` is not `$this->conn`and is identical to `$app['db'].
Moreover, column `id` must be auto-increment.

Can you squash your commits before I merge? Thanks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-08-29T19:55:15Z

@mageekguy when squashing, you need to force the push after that. Here, you merged your remote branch, meaning you kept all the older commits as well.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mageekguy at 2012-08-29T20:06:49Z

Know it, but my push was refused because not fast-forward.
So i pull and push, with this result.
And i don't kown what to do know :/.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-08-29T20:32:21Z

You need to force push. Like this: `git push --force origin master`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-08-29T23:24:27Z

@mageekguy not being a fast-forward is expected when squashing as you are rewriting the history.

And in such case, git tells you about both solutions (merging and forcing the push). You choose the wrong one :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-08-30T09:42:38Z

hmm, looks like you messed something when rebasing

If you're in a hurry:

    cd /path/to/your/project
    cd vendor/silex/silex
    git remote add henrikbjorn https://github.com/henrikbjorn/Silex.git
    git fetch henrikbjorn
    git checkout henrikbjorn/form-httpfoundation

Thanks so much; I really appreciate it!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by bradlet at 2012-08-02T16:16:58Z

I'm a little confused. This update breaks form validation using the constraints array option, like in the Silex docs:

```php
<?php
$form = $app['form.factory']->createBuilder('form')
    ->add('name', 'text', array(
        'constraints' => array(new Assert\NotBlank(), new Assert\MinLength(5))
    ))
```

It throws a `Symfony\Component\OptionsResolver\Exception\InvalidOptionsException`.

Is this something that is no longer allowed within Silex?
Do we need to now make classes like in the Symfony Forms component documentation?"

f618014 Remove use of the `use` in closure

Discussion
----------

Remove use of the `use` in closure

See https://github.com/fabpot/Pimple/blob/master/lib/Pimple.php#L81 :
Pimple give to the closure (as first argument) the container/application,
so we do not need to use `use($app)`.

Note :

* I did not test on php 5.4. But tests are OK on 5.3
* I think it is cleaner to use php default arguments than the use of `use`
* I fixed the CS :  `function()` -> `function ()` (added a space before `(`)"

Fix PHP 5.4 built-in webserver front controller

The problem is that with `php -S localhost:8080 -t web` it will only route
one level of paths to index.php. This is stupid, but requires us to use
a router script, which means that we must specify `index.php` and have
that script return false when the web server should serve from disk.

Thanks to @schokocappucino for the hints."

bcbd71e Add minimum-stability flag to all composer.json samples

Discussion
----------

Add minimum-stability flag to all composer.json samples

Today marks the release of composer alpha4. This changes the default
stability from dev to stable, which means that if you want to use un-
stable dependencies, you either have to specify a root package level
minimum-stability, or use the @dev constraint, i.e. ""1.0.*@dev"".

We are setting the minimum-stability, so that we do not have to use
@dev for all dependencies, and all dependencies of dependencies.

We can increase the stability to beta once we release a beta of silex
(this will use Symfony 2.1 beta releases), and when we make a final
release (some time after Symfony 2.1.0), the flag can be removed."

Discussion

Avoid Swift Mailer initialization if possible

The finish() filter flushing spool messages after each request
caused Swift Mailer to be initialized and all services in this
provider to be instantiated.

Doing all this work takes time and is potentially unnecessary,
since only a small number of all requests queue messages for sending.

The time it takes to initialize swiftmailer and all services is between
1 and 2ms on the 2 machines I tested on.
This seems like a big price to pay for just including a provider
that does nothing for most requests."

Until now we tried to detect `mailer` service changes,
and always flushed messages for them, just to be safe.

To keep things simple, we don't do this anymore.
If `mailer` gets replaced by another service, flushing will
fail as expected. People should not replace it."

e408ca4 Pulled standard auth mechanisms in to extendable factories

Discussion
----------

Pull standard auth mechanisms in to extendable factories

I'm not really too sure about this implementation myself, but it got me where I needed to be, in that I can define a factory for a custom authentication provider and list the type in the firewall config, something like this:

``` php
<?php

$app['security.firewalls'] = array(
    'api' => array(
        'pattern' => '^/api',
        'wsse' => true,
        'anonymous' => true,
    ),
);

$app['security.authentication.factory.wsse'] = $app->protect(function ($name, $options) use ($app) {
    $app['security.entry_point.wsse.'.$name] = new WsseEntryPoint(...);
    return array(new WsseListener(...), 'wsse');
});

```

I can't see any particular use case for overriding the standard factories (particularly because the _proto functions are there to override) but they are there if someone comes up with one, and it seemed to make things neater in the block building the firewall map.

I've got enough here so that I can move on with my project, if this approach is good enough, I can refine it as necessary, if not, any guidance would be appreciated and I'll work on something better."

PHP 5.4 support

This is a first attempt to provide useful shortcut methods on the Application class via traits. It also contains a `secure` method for routes.

Here is how you can make use of these features on PHP 5.4:

    use Silex\Application;
    use Silex\Route;

    class MyApp extends Application
    {
        use Application\TwigTrait;
        use Application\SecurityTrait;
        use Application\FormTrait;
        use Application\UrlGeneratorTrait;
        use Application\SwiftmailerTrait;
        use Application\MonologTrait;
        use Application\TranslationTrait;
    }

    class MyRoute extends Route
    {
        use Route\SecurityTrait;
    }

    $app = new MyApp();
    $app['route_factory'] = function () use ($app) {
        return new MyRoute();
    };

This PR depends on #376.

And here is a sample controller using the traits:

    $app->get('/{name}', function(Application $app, Request $request, $name) {

        $app->mail(\Swift_Message::newInstance()
            ->setSubject('[YourSite] Feedback')
            ->setFrom(array('noreply@yoursite.com'))
            ->setTo(array('feedback@yoursite.com'))
            ->setBody($request->get('message')));

        $app->log('Foo Bar');

        return $app->render('hello', [
            'name' => $name,
            'url'  => $app->url('home', ['name' => 'Fabien']),
            'user' => $app->user(),
        ]);
    })
    ->bind('home')
    ->assert('name', '\w+')
    ->secure('ROLE_ADMIN') // <- method defined in Route\SecurityTrait
    ;

As you can see, it makes things much more readable and easier to understand. And of course, it makes Silex very flexible as you can add any method on Application and Route. You just need to define a trait and register it on your custom Application or Route.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-06-17T15:32:15Z

Another option to avoid having to override the route factory is to define a parameter for the route class:

    $app['route_class'] = 'MyRoute';

Most of the time this should be sufficient.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fzaninotto at 2012-06-17T16:56:59Z

VERY readable. This change makes Silex even better. Great idea!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mrmark at 2012-06-18T17:42:57Z

This is really awesome!  Really shows off the power of traits.

I was trying out Silex a while ago, and I wanted to try to extend the Silex\Application class, but this sort of broke down at the [Silex\ControllerProviderInterface](https://github.com/fabpot/Silex/blob/master/src/Silex/ControllerProviderInterface.php#L28) because it expects the Silex\Application class.  This means that IDE's and the like wouldn't know about any new methods in my new class.  This is probably more important now with this PR because the IDE wouldn't know about any of the traits used.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-06-18T17:46:55Z

@mrmark There is nothing we can do for it. We cannot document the doc by mentioning your own application class. It would be wrong as the silex application class is valid, and it would be impossible as your own application class is not part of silex.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mrmark at 2012-06-18T18:17:20Z

@stof Sorry, I wasn't suggesting that Silex be modified to accommodate my application class specifically.  I'm not actually sure of the solution here, perhaps change the interface to look like so:

    public function connect($app);

And then depend upon the PHPDoc to tell the IDE what $app really is?  In the end, it would be nice if we knew what $app really was so we would know what methods and the like are available.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-06-18T18:19:20Z

@mrmark the issue is the same: the phpdoc is still in the Silex code. And removing typehints just because inheritance is allowed is wrong IMO

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-06-19T07:51:38Z

I've just added a bunch of unit tests for the new traits. Any other thoughts before I merge?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GromNaN at 2012-06-19T08:05:22Z

Trait tests should be skipped for PHP < 5.4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-06-19T08:07:38Z

@GromNaN That's already the case.

made controller methods (before, after, ...) extensible

You can now add your own methods on controllers (like the built-in
after, before, convert, ...) by defining your own Route class:

    class MyRoute extends Route
    {
        public function secure($roles, $app)
        {
            // do something
        }
    }

and then change the ""route_factory"" accordingly:

    $this['route_factory'] = function () {
        return new MyRoute();
    };

If you want to benefit from the new methods in a custom controller
collection, pass an instance of your Route to the ControllerCollection
constructor:

    $controllers = new ControllerCollection(new MyRoute());

or even better, use the ""controllers_factory"" service:

    $controllers = $app['controllers_factory'];

The limitation is that you can only have one custom Route class in an
Application. But this PR is just the first step. Thanks to PHP 5.4 and
the new traits support, the next pull request (#378) uses this new
refactoring to provide traits that you can add to your
custom Application Route class.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-06-18T12:13:33Z

Looks good to me. One thing, what about a method_exists() in `__call` to give a better error message?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-06-18T17:41:34Z

I've added an exception for when the method does not exist.

Application. But this PR is just the first step. Thanks to PHP 5.4 and
the new traits support, the next pull request will use this new
refactoring to provide traits that you will be able to add to your
custom Application Route class."

if you make the phar executable, it will work without using ``php``, thanks to the shebang. But adding the command is indeed a good idea for windows users."

This is a very specific configuration (assets, ...). I don't see any value to add that to the Silex documentation.

by j0k3r at 2012-06-16T11:06:48Z

I can remove the assets & favicon part.
I know that few people were looking for the lighttpd configuration for Silex. I put this few lines in the readme file of one my little project so I thought it would be worth it in the official documentation."

Fixed a bug when using http authentication on the security service provider

Hi Fabien,

When I added HTTP authentication to my Silex application an exception was thrown. Due the exception I wasn't able to use HTTP authentication when I accessed the application through the browser.

I used the following security firewall:
```php
'http-auth' => array(
    'pattern' => '^.*$',
    'http' => true,
    'users' => array(
        // password is foo
        'admin'  => array('ROLE_ADMIN', '5FZ2Z8QIkA7UTZ4BYkoC+GsReLf569mSKDsfods6LYQ8t+a8EW9oaircfMpmaLbPBh4FOBiiFyLfuZmTSUwzZg=='),
    ),
)
```

The following exception was thrown:
```
InvalidArgumentException: Identifier ""security.entry_point.http"" is not defined
```

It's a small fix and I also added some tests. All tests passed before I committed my changes.

I would appreciate it when you take a look at this pull request."

Implements route after middleware (closes #336)

This PR renames the `middleware` method to `before` and adds a new `after` route middleware.

These changes make Silex more consistent from a user point of view:

 * he can do something before the route callback on an application, a route collection, or just a route (by calling the `before` method on these objects);

 * he can do something after the route callback by calling the `after` method on an application, a route collection, or just a route.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-06-13T18:20:37Z

I thought about using the `middleware` method for both before and after by passing the callback as an argument. But this has several drawback:

 * we loose the symmetry with the application before/after calls;
 * the developer must remember to manually call the callback (and symfony1 proves that many devs actually forgets about that);
 * this would act as a filter chain where the order of execution is not always clear when you have many filters."

@fabpot can you merge this if you are agree with that pull ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by rkmax at 2011-07-30T14:27:09Z

can you explain what /vendor/symfony/src need exactly

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alOneh at 2011-07-31T13:27:39Z

/vendor/symfony/src is use to load the Symfony Form component, the [Symfony Bridge](http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Bridge/Twig/Extension.html) who provide extensions for Form and Translation in Twig

@fabpot are you agree with that PR ?

I just updated the form provider documenation

Seems good to me. I will update the doc when it will be merged.

@fabpot : I updated my proposal PR for the FormServiceProvider. Can you check if there is anything missing ? /cc igorw

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2011-10-09T13:05:49Z

Looks good to me.

Might be interesting to add another section about validation using the `validation_constraint` form option, see also http://knplabs.com/en/blog-csi/symfony-validators-standalone

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alOneh at 2011-10-09T14:02:38Z

I updated the example with the validation_constraint, I think now its good.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

poke @fabpot

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2011-10-10T19:55:05Z

Looks good to me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2011-10-16T23:53:48Z

Hm, maybe validation_constraint should be a separate example. Also we should not use the UrlGenerator.

IMO it needs to be clear that those things are optional.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alOneh at 2011-10-18T09:01:48Z

@igorw, I use the UrlGenerator because I can't get a fully working example without it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by netzhuffle at 2011-11-28T17:15:12Z

@alOneh You could try $request->getUriForPath() instead of the UrlGenerator.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alOneh at 2012-01-16T14:47:20Z

is this PR is ready for merge after the latest change ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-01-16T15:02:12Z

It introduces extensions.rst which was renamed to providers.rst. You need to merge upstream master into your branch and then make sure everything is correct.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alOneh at 2012-01-16T15:52:00Z

My mistake. I fix this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

poke @igorw @fabpot

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-02-12T23:04:01Z

This (still) looks good to me.

Minor thing: API docs links should probably be changed to 2.1 now. Not sure if others are also affected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alOneh at 2012-02-12T23:08:06Z

Others are not yet affected. Maybe in a single PR for all API docs links

Added the LocaleListener to handle setting the locale

This registers the LocaleListener setting the request locale according to the matching of the special ``_locale`` parameter and setting the locale in the routing RequestContext so that it is always available.

This PR should be merged only after the update of the subtree split as it requires the typehint change merged just before in Symfony"

3ed4cdf Add exceptions for removed autoloader service and class_loader parameters

Discussion
----------

Add exceptions for removed features

As I said before, we need to tell the users about removed features. We cannot expect them to constantly check the changelog, and I refuse to spend my time providing support because of this.

This PR adds exceptions for the autoloader service, all of the *.class_path parameters and the SymfonyBridgesServiceProvider. Those exceptions should give the user at least some idea about what is going on, and hopefully reduce the amount of support tickets we get.

We can remove these exceptions when we release 1.0.0-RC1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by neurolit at 2012-06-03T18:02:34Z

I totally agree with you. It's quite painful to maintain a webapp based on Silex, as APIs are changing all the time. Such exceptions would be of much help!"

Couldn't find a better way to test it so any comments are more than welcome!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-05-25T16:04:29Z

Not a good idea, the asserts may not be executed. Also, please don't call run. Call terminate explicitly.

My approach would be:

* define a controller that sends a message
* check the spool to make sure it's empty
* call handle()
* check the spool to make sure it has a message
* call terminate
* check the spool to make sure the message is flushed

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ricardclau at 2012-05-25T16:10:27Z

Sounds much better, I'll try my best as you suggest.

Although your method seems much better than mine, I'm curious... in which cases asserts would not be executed?

Commits
-------

c753641 added the ServiceProviderInterface::boot() method

Discussion
----------

added the ServiceProviderInterface::boot() method

The `register` method for the service providers should only be about configuring services and parameters. But some service providers (monolog, swiftmailer, and session) also register some event listeners which means that the `dispatcher` service is created.

This makes some things impossible like replacing the `dispatcher` service (except if you make sure to override it *before* the other providers). Also, if you want to use Monolog for the logger, it won't work as there is a chicken and egg problem.

So, I propose to introduce a new `boot()` method on `ServiceProviderInterface` that must be called after all the providers are registered.

The `boot()` method is automatically called by the `handle()` method if not already called by the developer.

TODO: update the doc

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-05-26T09:59:48Z

We can avoid the BC break by creating a new `BootableServiceProviderInterface` but it seems overkill (especially because we are not stable yet).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-05-26T10:36:05Z

:+1: And I agree that adding a new interface is overkill

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-05-27T18:14:06Z

I'm not so happy with the BC break and that an additional method is required, but I can't think of any better way to solve this cleanly. So I guess let's go for it."

Added Twig_Extension_Debug if app is in debug mode

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-04-16T21:51:12Z

This was done initially in the PR adding it. But it has been reverted to avoid hard-to-debug issues when you have a template containing a dump call (it would work properly in your dev environment but throw an exception in your prod environment)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lyrixx at 2012-05-12T14:12:09Z

@stof but it's very usefull ... more over, every dev add this extension.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-05-12T23:36:27Z

@lyrixx The issue is that if it will be added only in debug mode and you forget to remove a dump call from your template, it will work properly in your dev environment (where Twig will be in debug mode with the extension) whereas the compilation of the template will fail in prod (because the function will not be defined anymore)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lyrixx at 2012-05-13T13:21:20Z

@stof Yes I understood. I did the patch... But every time, on a new projet, I copy/paste these lines to my projet. And I am not the only one. So I think we could add this feature into silex. (And why not in twig ? )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-05-13T18:08:36Z

@lyrixx When I said it was done previously, I was talking about Twig itself, not about Silex.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ok, I've changed the strategy to what I've described above. ping @igorw

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-05-21T16:09:56Z

`ControllerCollection extends Controller` is weird. I see how some code can be re-used, but a controller cannot be frozen or named, so those parts don't really make sense to me.

Apart from that it's a nice feature. If you can come up with a cleaner way to do it that doesn't bloat the code too much, that'd be nice.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-05-21T16:30:16Z

What about creating a `Route` class that extends the Symfony `Route` class? It would contain the `assert`, `value`, `requireHttp`, `requireHttps`, `convert`, and `middleware` methods. Then, `Controller` and `ControllerCollection` extend this new `Route` class.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-05-21T16:33:23Z

Extending the `Route` is not necessarily a good idea either. What about creating this `Route` class and compose it into both `Controller` and `ControllerCollection`?

As the Apache FallbackResource directive makes rewriting even easier (and also faster) than mod_rewrite, I thought I'd mention it in the docs."

[Travis] Removed tests on php 5.3.2

Like in symfony/symfony

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-05-12T15:10:16Z

If you look at the commit on symfony/symfony, it removes the tests for 5.3.3, because that version is not available on travis.

Depending on why exactly it was bumped on symfony/symfony, it may make sense to bump the official requirement of silex/silex to 5.3.3 as well.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lyrixx at 2012-05-12T15:13:56Z

They removed support of php 5.3.2 because of ubuntu 10.04 LTS is deprecated. Now ubuntu 12.04 (new LTS) supports php 5.3.3

As symfony 2 drop support of php 5.3.2, I think silex have to drop this support ?
My be I forgot to update composer.json ?"

added autoload_classmap.php to the list of .composer files to include

Hi,

I suspect this is my own stupidity since no-one else has reported it, but for me the silex.phar dies when required because it doesn't contain a file that it tries to require: ""vendor/.composer/autoload_classmap.php"".

I've tried the silex.phar from the project homepage, and also compiled my own from the source code with the same result.  Unpacking either shows indeed that there is no autoload_classmap.php file.

Had a quick look and saw that some other vendor/.composer/*.php files were listed in the Compiler.php class, added in the missing classmap file, and everything seemed to work fine.

As I said, I think I must be missing something, because otherwise silex would be completely broken for just about everybody! using the phar!

Hi,

Afaik, the .phar archive does not work with composer as it has not been managed by it. Hence composer does not know anything about phars you could use. I may be wrong but If you use the phar you should use Silex's autoloader or add silex to your dependencies in your `composer.json` instead.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-03-28T13:54:31Z

@pete-otaqui This should indeed fix the issue :+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by pete-otaqui at 2012-03-28T14:19:44Z

I think you misunderstand me.  I'm not using composer, I just tried the example _from the Silex homepage_:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__.'/silex.phar';

$app = new Silex\Application();

$app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($name) use ($app) {
  return 'Hello '.$app->escape($name);
});

$app->run();
```

For me this throws the following error:

```
Warning: require(phar:///var/www/silex/silex.phar/vendor/.composer/autoload_classmap.php): failed to open stream: phar error: ""vendor/.composer/autoload_classmap.php"" is not a file in phar ""/var/www/silex/silex.phar"" in phar:///var/www/silex/silex.phar/vendor/.composer/autoload.php on line 17

Fatal error: require(): Failed opening required 'phar:///var/www/silex/silex.phar/vendor/.composer/autoload_classmap.php' (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in phar:///var/www/silex/silex.phar/vendor/.composer/autoload.php on line 17
```

If you look at the commit I made, you'll see that the Compiler class (which creates the silex.phar) does indeed include some stuff from vendor/.composer/ ... it's just that it doesn't include ""autoload_classmap.php"".

Possibly this file is supposed to be automatically generated by something inside silex.phar, and for some reason mine isn't writeable, but in that case I ought really to get a different error.

6445b9e Add Routes Middlewares

Discussion
----------

add ""after($callback)"" to Controller in order to mimic a ""Route Middleware"" feature in Silex

Hi !

As discussed in #262 and in my previous similar PR (https://github.com/fabpot/Silex/pull/270) with @GromNaN, here is another implementation of the Routes Middlewares feature, shipped with its Unit Test.

The feature addition is still 100% backward compatible, but this time it may be more ""Silex style"" compliant - and it's ""100% no performance loss"" :-)

With this PR the Silex ```Controller``` class has a new ```before()``` method, which registers a callback to trigger when the Route is matched, just before the route callback itself.
This ```before()``` method can be called more than one time on a single Route definition, allowing multiple secondary callbacks (a.k.a. ""Routes Middlewares"") to be executed before the Route main callback.

Would this feature be eligible for Silex integration, like this ?

Olivier

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DrBenton at 2012-03-01T22:16:05Z

* The method is now named ```addMiddleware```, which may be more explicit for people used to ""a la Sinatra"" framewoks like _Node.js Express_  or _Slim_.
* I no longer use the Silex ControllerResolver, but a dedicated Application protected service instead, fired just before the Application ""before"" process (I could have added a new listener on the ```Kernel```, but since we already have one for the right event for the ""before"" process, I used this one for simpler code).
* I also added some checks on the ```$request``` in the Unit Test.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2012-03-02T11:40:30Z

Can you add some information about this new feature in the documentation (with some typical usages)? Thanks for your work on this feature.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DrBenton at 2012-03-02T12:35:44Z

**Done !** (the method is now named ```middleware```, and I've removed the useless comment)

I've tried my best for the feature documentation, but unfortunately my english is fairly poor... :-/

At this point, the Middlewares have access to the Request, but if I'm not wrong it can't be used for redirecting, for instance. Should I handle ```Response``` returns from middlewares, as in ```before``` filter ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GromNaN at 2012-03-02T12:39:00Z

I guess you can throw an exception (access denied for example) and manage this exception with the error handlers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DrBenton at 2012-03-02T12:44:38Z

Yes, in the sample usage of the documentation I've used exactly that ```Exception``` process.
But I don't know if this is ok for everyone ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-03-02T15:08:29Z

Very nice feature. But it should really be possible to return a response from the handler, like you can do with before() filters.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DrBenton at 2012-03-02T21:15:41Z

All right, I think I know how to handle Responses, thanks to the code of the before() filter ; I'll push soon a new commit with the last code syle fixes and this feature !

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DrBenton at 2012-03-03T11:34:44Z

Ok, I've fixed the code style problems, and handled the Responses from middlewares.
What do you think of it ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DrBenton at 2012-03-05T13:11:56Z

So... Are we OK for this feature, gentlemen ? :-)
Do you want me to push a squashed commit ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-03-05T22:24:53Z

Apart from the minor comments I made I am quite happy with the implementation as it is. I guess when those are fixed it can be merged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DrBenton at 2012-03-05T22:58:23Z

Sorry for all these ""code style"" errors, I'm still not enough used to Symfony 2 coding standards - but I'll get them ! :-)

Well, all these errors should be fixed now. I also swapped  the order of execution with the Silex global ```before``` filters, as you asked it: the global filters are now triggered **before** the middlewares of the matched route.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-03-05T23:10:35Z

I'm not so sure about checking for `instanceof Response`. Maybe we should enforce a middleware to return either null or a Response to prevent unexpected behaviour.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DrBenton at 2012-03-06T14:37:42Z

Well, I just copied the behaviour of the ```before``` filter :
```
if ($ret instanceof Response) {
    $event->setResponse($ret);
}```
(in Application.php, line 237)

Since route middlewares act as this ```before``` filter (in a ""specific for each route"" way), I thought we could copy the code of this ```before``` functionnality ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DrBenton at 2012-03-08T14:34:13Z

So ? Do you want me to change the ```instanceof Response```, or can we keep the current ""copy of before filter"" implementation ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2012-03-08T15:57:00Z

IMO we should add something like this:

    if ($response instanceof Response) {
        ...
    } elseif (null !== $response) {
        throw new \RuntimeException('Before filter (or middleware for route foo) returned an invalid response value. Must return null or an instance of Response.');
    }

I just spent an hour trying to figure out why using path() in Twig when using Silex wasn't working.  Turns out I hadn't included the SymfonyBridgesServiceProvider, which isn't mentioned in this piece of documentation.

I don't know if this makes the comment too verbose, but if it saves someone else wasting time it'll be worth it."

[stream] Add a nice API for streaming responses

This PR adds a nice API for creating streaming responses with the new StreamedResponse class that was added to symfony [just recently](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/2935).

Usage is documented in the usage doc, but for lazy people:

```php
<?php

$app->get('/images/{file}', function ($file) use ($app) {
    if (!file_exists(__DIR__.'/images/'.$file)) {
        return $app->abort(404, 'The image was not found.');
    }

    $stream = function () use ($file) {
        readfile($file);
    };

    return $app->stream($stream, 200, array('Content-Type' => 'image/png'));
});
```

Note: I had to point the autoloader to a copy of symfony/symfony because the subtree splits are not up-to-date. Thus the vendors are out of date too right now."

No instantiation needed, just call it statically on the request class:

    Request::trustProxyData();

If there is something about this in the Symfony2 docs, it'd be nice to link to it.

[docs] set detect_unicode=off, so phar:// is no longer needed

detect_unicode was causing some issues with wrongly detecting the encoding. This is one of the reasons that phar:// was required, but I am not sure if this is the only case. I will leave the ""phar-stub bug"" section there for now."

[DoctrineServiceProvider] Fix default options was not used

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2011/10/25 23:13:23 -0700

The code looks correct to as we are modifying the options by reference.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by jeromemacias at 2011/10/26 05:54:18 -0700

On the line 50 :

```php
$tmp = $app['dbs.options'];
```

This is a copy of options array, the reference used after does not has any effect on initial options array.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DrBenton at 2011/10/26 06:02:46 -0700

@jeromemacias But in the ``` foreach ($tmp as $name => &$options) ``` the ```$options``` var is referenced (with the use of ```&```), not copied.
Thus, if I'm not wrong, this loop *does* have an effect on ```$app['dbs.options']```.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by jeromemacias at 2011/10/26 12:36:40 -0700

@DrBenton The $options var is a reference to $tmp but $tmp is a copy of $apps['dbs.options'],  not a reference.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by jeromemacias at 2011/10/26 12:58:38 -0700

I used this config (json) :

```json
{
  ""db.options"":
  {
    ""dbname"": ""mydbname"",
    ""user"": ""mydbuser"",
    ""password"": ""mydbpass""
  }
}
```

With the current code :

```php
            $tmp = $app['dbs.options'];
            foreach ($tmp as $name => &$options) {
                $options = array_replace($app['db.default_options'], $options);

                if (!isset($app['dbs.default'])) {
                    $app['dbs.default'] = $name;
                }
            }

            var_export($app['dbs.options']); die;
```

The result is :

```php
array ( 'default' => array ( 'dbname' => 'mydbname', 'user' => 'mydbuser', 'password' => 'mydbpass', ), )
```

With the new code :

```php
            $tmp = $app['dbs.options'];
            foreach ($tmp as $name => &$options) {
                $options = array_replace($app['db.default_options'], $options);

                if (!isset($app['dbs.default'])) {
                    $app['dbs.default'] = $name;
                }
            }
            $app['dbs.options'] = $tmp;

            var_export($app['dbs.options']); die;
```

The result is :

```php
array ( 'default' => array ( 'driver' => 'pdo_mysql', 'dbname' => 'mydbname', 'host' => 'localhost', 'user' => 'mydbuser', 'password' => 'mydbpass', ), )
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2011/10/26 13:59:51 -0700

Issue confirmed, please reopen and merge.

EDIT: To be clear: the defaults are not being applied to dbs.options.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DrBenton at 2011/10/26 14:05:23 -0700

Sorry, you're right @jeromemacias. Since the values of ```$app['dbs.options']``` seem to be simple scalars, iterating though ```$tmp``` values, even by reference, does not affect ```$app['dbs.options']``` values. I thought ```$app['dbs.options']``` values where Objects (in that case, the code would have been ok).

My mistake !

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2011/10/26 14:13:41 -0700

We need some unit tests for this.

Create default set of listeners late

Right now the following subscribers are created together with the
dispatcher:

* app
* exception_handler
* ResponseListener
* RouterListener

With the exception_handler in particular this is an issue because you
can no longer change it after the dispatcher has been created. And it
gets created when you call before(), after() or error(). It means that
you cannot unset it for tests.

The RouterListener has a similar issue because you can no longer change
the UrlMatcher it uses. And you cannot move its creation into a request
listener, because request listeners cannot add other request listeners
(the new ones won't get executed anymore at that point).

This commit ensures that those listeners will be created a lot later,

The main idea is the move of all controller-related code from Application to
ControllerCollection. Reusable applications are now instances of
ControllerCollection instead of Application instances. That way, there is only
one ""true"" Application instance, and thus only one Pimple container.

Reusable applications can now be packaged as classes, like Extensions. It
allows to package services and controllers into one extension.

Benefits:

 * less hackish (proper wrapping in a class, no need to add a temporary route, no need for the LazyApplication anymore)
 * less code
 * simple and straightforward code (no magic anymore)
 * less side-effects
 * fix most severe/annoying limitations of the current implementation (from what I've read in the mailing-list and the Github issues)
 * better encapsulation of ""reusable"" applications
 * better separation of concerns
 * simple usage is exactly the same as before (as Application proxies the ControllerCollection methods for the ""default"" app)

Upgrading is as simple as replacing Application with ControllerCollection for
reusable apps (note that a reusable app is not ""standalone"" anymore):

    $mounted = new ControllerCollection();
    $mounted->get('/bar', function() { return 'foo'; });

    $app->mount('/foo', $mounted);

A better way now is to create a class:

    use Silex\ApplicationExtensionInterface;

    class FooApplication implements ApplicationExtensionInterface
    {
        public function connect(Application $app)
        {
            $controllers = new ControllerCollection();
            $controllers->get('/bar', function() { return 'foo'; });

            return $controllers;
        }
    }

    $app->mount('/foo', new FooApplication());

Note that you get the ""master"" application, so that you have access to the
services defined here.

If you want to register services, you can do so in the same extension:

    use Silex\ApplicationExtensionInterface;
    use Silex\ExtensionInterface;

    class FooApplication implements ApplicationExtensionInterface, ExtensionInterface
    {
        public function register(Application $app)
        {
            $app['some_service'] = ...;
        }

        public function connect(Application $app)
        {
            $controllers = new ControllerCollection();
            $controllers->get('/bar', function(Application $app) {
                $app['some_service']->...;

                return 'foo';
            });

            return $controllers;
        }
    }

    $ext = new FooApplication();
    $app->register($ext);
    $app->mount('/foo', $ext);"

Remove unnecessary capturing group in suggested rewrite rule

It's not used, nor needed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mheleniak at 2011/08/15 13:20:15 -0700

Same way `QSA,` could also be stripped in the same line, but this is so small, I think it's not worth the effort :-))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2011/08/15 15:12:36 -0700

@AD7six Please update `example.htaccess` as well.

@mheleniak I disagree, we do want the query string.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mheleniak at 2011/08/15 15:16:14 -0700

@igorw please read the docs about QSA flag:

     'qsappend|QSA' (query string append)
     This flag forces the rewrite engine to append a query string part of the substitution
     string to the existing string, instead of replacing it. Use this when you want to add
     more data to the query string via a rewrite rule.

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html

This option has nothing to do with passing query string to PHP and in our case can be safely removed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mheleniak at 2011/08/15 15:17:12 -0700

But as I said earlier such small changes usually takes more time to explain than has associated benefit with the change :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by AD7six at 2011/08/16 00:48:53 -0700

@mheleniak - interesting perspective. Do you generally recommend doing things in php that aren't necessary to avoid explaining why it's unnecessary?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by AD7six at 2011/08/16 01:20:36 -0700

@mheleniak is right, the QSA flag is also unnecessary - removing it does not affect the contents of superglobals.

I made removing that a seperate commit so that you can cherry-pick if you prefer.

Failed opening Silex/Application.php

I created a simple php file with this source:
<pre>
require_once __DIR__ . '/silex.phar';
$app = new Silex\Application();
</pre>

It then throw this php fatal error:
 PHP Fatal error:  require(): Failed opening required 'phar:///home/laurent/projects/bishop/silex.phar/src/Silex/Application.php' (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in phar:///home/laurent/projects/bishop/silex.phar/vendor/Symfony/Component/ClassLoader/UniversalClassLoader.php on line 60

I have same kind of php error if I try to use silex in command line. For example:
<pre>
php silex.phar version
</pre>

My PHP version is: 5.3.5-1ubuntu7.2

by laurent35240 at 2011/05/22 15:17:53 -0700

Yes I have tried it like that:
<pre>
  require_once __DIR__ . '/silex.phar';
  require_once 'phar://'.__DIR__.'/silex.phar/autoload.php';
  $app = new Silex\Application();
</pre>
But I still have the same error then :-(

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by awildeep at 2011/05/23 06:11:33 -0700

I have not run into this issue yet, but do you need to include the PHAR and the autoloader.php to get it running?

I would think that this would work:

    //require_once __DIR__ . '/silex.phar';
    require_once 'phar://'.__DIR__.'/silex.phar/autoload.php';
    $app = new Silex\Application();

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by laurent35240 at 2011/05/23 12:32:26 -0700

Nope it is still not working.

With this code
<pre>
  require_once 'phar://'.__DIR__.'/silex.phar/autoload.php';
  $app = new Silex\Application();
</pre>
I still have the error
<pre>
PHP Fatal error:  require(): Failed opening required 'phar:///home/laurent/projects/silex/silex.phar/src/Silex/Application.php' (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in phar:///home/laurent/projects/silex/silex.phar/vendor/Symfony/Component/ClassLoader/UniversalClassLoader.php on line 60
</pre>

by awildeep at 2011/05/23 13:09:56 -0700

What version of PHP are you running this with?

EDIT: Nevermind, I just saw your first post comment. Is there any way this could be using a older version of PHP?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by brtriver at 2011/05/24 02:06:31 -0700

Have you try this? Can you find the setting of Suhosin on your phpinfo page?
http://silex-project.org/doc/usage.html#php-configuration

> suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = phar

I doubt the setting of Suhosin. If not, I'm sorry.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by laurent35240 at 2011/05/27 15:43:55 -0700

I finaly found the solution to my problem.
It comes from the ioncube loader for encoded files that I installed for decoding php encoded file in other projects: http://www.ioncube.com/loaders.php

Maybe it will be good to add this in Pitfalls section of documentation: http://silex-project.org/doc/usage.html#pitfalls

Thx anyway to all of you who tried to help me

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by awildeep at 2011/05/28 06:41:27 -0700

@laurent35240 glad you found the problem.

It would seem that the obfuscating/compiling packages for PHP could play havoc with the phar.  phar packages are relatively new, and the compiler apps are 3rd party.   I was able to find a user having trouble using pear.phar here:

http://forum.ioncube.com/viewtopic.php?p=8867&sid=9102e30d35990d6caebd85cc458ebd6c

I could not find a reference to the ticket referenced above as the company does not publicly list any tickets, and their ticketing system appears to be broken.  Perhaps a note in the documentation stating that ""PHP compilers and obfuscation may cause issues as well"" is in order.   Anyone on the list running any other compilers or obfuscation systems?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by laurent35240 at 2011/05/28 07:13:43 -0700

I added in documentation details about this problem and did a pull request here: https://github.com/fabpot/Silex/pull/104

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ratibus at 2011/07/12 06:23:38 -0700

I had the same issue but upgrading the ioncube loader to the latest version solved it. I used the 6th June 2011 version (v4.0.9).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by laurent35240 at 2011/07/12 12:03:53 -0700

Using last version of ioncube loader solved the issue for me too.

Good to see that ioncube manage correctly PHAR archive now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2011/07/12 12:05:16 -0700

Sweet! Do you want to make a pull request to the docs, mentioning this?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by laurent35240 at 2011/07/14 14:16:21 -0700

Sure it will be nice to mention in documentation that upgrading ioncube can resolve this problem

9c95e2f only execute phar stub on direct invocation of phar archive

Discussion
----------

Make silex.phar usable in CLI applications

Currently, requiring silex.phar in a CLI application that takes arguments is not possible, as the phar stub interferes with the execution of the application. I added a check to the stub which will execute the main stub code only if the phar file is directly invoked.
We ran into this issue when trying to reuse the dependency setup from our Silex-based web application in the Doctrine2 ORM CLI console application, which obviously requires arguments. I know Silex is not supposed to run command line applications, but being able to reuse already configured dependencies in a CLI application should be made possible.

Not quite sure what you mean by ""If you want to test single file app use Symfony2's Reqeuest instead."", mind to explain / rephrase?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by brtriver at 2011/05/19 10:27:37 -0700

How about this?

> If you want to test a single file app, it is difficult to test because it doesn't return the instance of your application.
> to make your application testable with WebTestCase, you need to make sure you follow ""Reusing applications"" instructions from :doc:`usage`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by igorw at 2011/05/19 10:38:15 -0700

I think the original sentence is quite explanatory, just turning that into a note seems sufficient to me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by brtriver at 2011/05/19 10:44:32 -0700

I just set the original sentense to a note.

Autoloader fix

[Autoloading] Made the require_once of the UnviversalClassLoader conditional.

As we can't know what happened before we require the silex.phar file, we
can't deduce if an autoloader has already been required.
It can lead to fatal errors for cases like it is in SilexBundle.

you can get the current version by calling the phar without arguments:

    $ php silex.phar
    Silex version 1ee6b36

there is only one single `update` command:

    $ php silex.phar update

this will fetch the latest version of the phar from silex-project.org
and replace the current one with it.

this makes it easier for users because they can easily update. we could
potentially even provide a changelog on running the command.

this commit also introduces a Silex\Application::VERSION constant that
currently is set to the current git SHA-1, as I proposed in PR 33. This
is done by the Compiler. It can later be adjusted to use `git describe`.

this is an implementation of PR 35 without the console component."

The challenge is to allow the RouteCollection to be mutable while making
it possible to set Route names. We do not want to set the route name
when creating the Controller (it must be optional, adding it after the
closure is ugly as hell), and RouteCollection does not allow changing
route names after they have been added.

The way to solve this is to add a staging area for these routes. This
staging area is the ControllerCollection. All defined controllers are
added to this area. Once the flush() method is called on the
ControllerContainer, the controllers are frozen (no name change
possible) and added as routes to the RouteContainer.

If you want to make use of the RouteCollection (for example: dumping out
routes to the console), you must explicitly call flush() on the
ControllerCollection. There was no good way to do this implicitly. The
application will also call flush() if you use handle() or run().

TLDR:
a) We can now set route names
b) Call getControllerCollection()->flush() before getRouteCollection()
c) We must document flushing
d) Bulat is awesome"
