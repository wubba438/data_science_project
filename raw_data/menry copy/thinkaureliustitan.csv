used was too old to support this setting.  Upgraded to a newer version

This commit introduces StoreFeatures.supportsInterruption specifically
for BerkeleyDB JE.  BDB responds with undefined behavior when a thread
is interrupted while inside a blocking IO call.  ""Undefined behavior""
in this case tends to mean that all subsequent calls to the
environment (barring a manual recovery operation) appear to fail with
exceptions.

As of this commit, C* and HBase return true for supportsInterruption,
while BDB returns false.

The only place I've found so far where this matters is ID allocation.
StandardIDPool works by starting a loop-forever background task that
attempts to call getIDBlock until the first time it succeeds.
StandardIDPool then watches the clock and attempts to cancel the
background task if it has exceeded its timeout.  Cancelation sent a
thread interrupt, which in turn broke BDB JE's environment.

StandardIDPool now has a collaborative/discretionary background task
cancellation mechanism: it sets a volatile boolean field to true when
it wants the background task to shutdown, and the background task
checks it during its loop between each blocking call.  This field is
always set now when StandardIDPool wants the background task to abort.
Furthermore, StandardIDPool checks StoreFeatures.supportsInterruption
(actually, it calls IDAuthority.supportsInterruption, which wraps a
call to the same-named method on its underlying store features).  If
interruption is allowed, it calls future.cancel(true) on the task,
same as prior to this commit.  If interruption is not allowed, then
StandardIDPool adds the future to a deque.  This deque is drained and
`get` invoked on each element during StandardIDPool's close method.
This last queue-draining ensures that a clean shutdown doesn't leave
BDB in an inconsistent state because a background task was still
mid-IO-call.

Fixes #1148"

The most flexible and general way to support this on titan09 seems to
be to let the user supply an arbitrary o.a.hadoop.conf.Configuration
object which becomes the basis for the index management MapReduce job
that the user intends to run.  This lets the user load custom Hadoop
options as classpath resources, input streams, file paths, or as
object instances.

Options set by the MapReduce index jobs themselves (e.g. to tell the
job the index's name) still override options from the user's
o.a.hadoop.conf.Configuration.  The idea is that this feature supports
changing arbitrary options that affect the job's performance or
robustness that are outside the immediate scope of the index
management job itself (e.g. cassandra.thrift.framed.size_mb).

Expanded the HBaseCompat shims enough to hide the ABI and API
differences across the HBase [0.94, 1.0.2] version range.
HConnection, HTable, and HBaseAdmin have been renamed or are
deprecated and in the process of being renamed.  Most of their methods
have the same signatures and functionality.  However, some other
classes that were mostly stable also underwent minor method signature
tweaks that break the ABI.  For instance, Delete.setTimestamp used to
return void.  Now it returns a Delete (this).  In testing, this
signature change caused MethodNotFoundException to be thrown when code
compiled for one signature ran against the other (even though it
ignored the return value).

titan-hbase-10/src/test/bin is a copy of 1.0.2's files with classpath
and jruby location tweaks.  For future reference, the tweaks are
stored in patch form (based on 1.0.2) inside the directory.

The only testing I've done is to check that HBaseGraphTest passes for
0.94, 0.98, and 1.0.  I ignored 0.96 since it's technically EOL.

This commit adds two fake copies of a pair of Guava classes
titan-hbase-care: Stopwatch and Closeables.  HBase depends on Guava
12, which is substantially behind titan09's current 16, let alone
Guava's latest stable 18; both of these Guava classes underwent
compatibility-breaking changes between 12 and 16.  The HBase code
compiled against Guava 12 produces runtime errors when executed
against Guava 16:

* the nullary Stopwatch constructor is no longer public (replaced by
  static methods that invoke the constructor)

* Stopwatch.elapsedMillis() was removed (replaced by
  elapesed(timeunit))

* Closeables.closeQuietly was removed (replaced by close(boolean
  swallowExceptions))

The fake copies of Stopwatch and Closeables in this commit adds the
deleted Guava functionality that HBase still depends upon (in the case
of the nullary Stopwatch constructor, it just changes the visibility
level from package to public).

To force the fake classes to take precedence, the shell scripts now
build $CLASSPATH with all jars matching the glob ""titan*.jar""
(including titan-hbase) at the beginning and remaining jars (including
Guava) at the end.

This was substantially more invasive than 2.0.x patchlevel upgrades.

* C*2.1 is incompatible with Guava 15.  Upgraded to 16 to match C*2.1.
  I assume this broke HBase 0.94 due to experiencing
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9667 last time I tried
  upgrading Guava.  #854 targeting Guava 18 is still open at the time
  of this commit, but a bunch of stuff broke during the C*2.1 upgrade,
  so I wanted to make the smallest possible Guava version move
  (15->16) in this commit and stabilize titan-cassandra before trying
  to go to 18.

* C*2.1 uses JNA 4.  Upgrading C* also introduced dependency
  convergence failures for it.unimi.dsi:fastutil,
  clearspring.analytics:stream, and commons-math3 (but not
  commons-math).  Added dependencyManagement stanzas to use the newer
  version in each case.

* C*2.1 includes some CQL-friendly internals refactoring, e.g. the
  move from Column to Cell and the introduction of the sparse-vs-dense
  column idiom.  It also removed the mostly useless type parameters on
  Token and IPartitioner.  These changes required minor tweaks in the
  thrift/astyanax store and more extensive changes in the embedded
  store.

* C*2.1 uses logback.  logback ships with its own slf4j binding (which
  took precedence over the log4j-slf4j12 binding due to an accident of
  classpath ordering when I first upgraded the C* version).  Titan
  currently uses log4j for all of its tests, and if we eventually do
  move to logback, we should do it consistently throughout Titan; I
  don't want a mixture of logback.xml and log4j.properties files
  scattered throughout the submodules and living together indefinitely
  on a major branch.  I had to explicitly redeclare the slf4j-log4j12
  artifact and the logback-classic artifact that contains logback's
  slf4j binding in titan-cassandra/pom.xml (in that order) to force
  the log4j12 binding to take precedence over the logback binding.

* C*2.1 has retired several config keys in our testing cassandra.yaml
  and refuses to start if they are present:

  * memtable_flush_queue_size
  * in_memory_compaction_limit_in_mb
  * multithreaded_compaction
  * compaction_preheat_key_cache
  * preheat_kernel_page_cache

  I deleted these keys.  I think we were using the default value in
  each case anyway.

* C*2.1 uses JAMM 0.3.0 (older C* versions used 0.2.5).  This required
  updating the -javaagent JVM parameter in our shell scripts.

* C*2.1 uses a library called airline for command-line argument
  parsing in nodetool (maybe other commands too?).  airline does not
  get pulled in automatically as a dependency of titan-cassandra.  I
  explicitly declared it as a dependency on titan-dist at version 0.6,
  the version that shipped in C*2.1.8's distro.

* Merged miscellaneous upstream changes to the C* shell scripts that
  we include in the Titan zipfiles.  Aside from accounting for
  nodetool's main class getting renamed, these changes seemed like
  mostly quoting fixes and environment sanity checks (like printing a
  helpful message when the script can't find the java binary).  I
  excluded the shell script changes related to logback, keeping the C*
  daemon started by titan.sh on log4j for now.

I updated the versions matrix to list Titan 1.0.0 as compatible with
C* 1.2, 2.0, and 2.1.  Only the thrift/astyanax adapters are really
compatible with 1.2 and 2.0 on the server-side; the embedded adapter
is now closely wedded to 2.1 and cannot compile or run using older
versions of the C* jar.  This is difficult to communicate in the
matrix, and I would rather emphasize the thrift/astyanax adapter
compatibility at the expense of clarity around the embedded adapter,
since the latter is unsupported.

All of the titan-cassandra tests passed as of this commit.

Elasticsearch reserves a Titan config namespace under which the user
may provide arbitrary Elasticsearch config options.  These options
can't be validated, since it's fundamentally a bit of a perversion of
the config API: the keys are defined in and controlled by
Elasticsearch, but we're cramming them into a Titan configuration.

This commit tweaks TitanFactory.Builder to use a WriteConfiguration
(which is based on dumb strings) instead of a ModifiableConfiguration
(which is based on ConfigOption and includes validation).

A more elegant way to approach this might be to introduce an
abstraction to support Elasticsearch's reserved namespace: some kind
of boolean field that says, in effect, ""don't try to validate any keys
underneath me"".  That still wouldn't totally address the problem,
though; (User)ModifiableConfiguration still wouldn't be a suitable
basis for TitanFactory.Builder, since it requires that any
user-provided config key string map to a ConfigOption.

This commit also adds a test (that fails without the TitanFactory
change).

`g` is pretty confusing as it is generally used to traverse aka: `graph.traversal()`. I changed the name in the configuration file to `graph` so that it would follow in the steps of the gremlin-server configuration and is more intuitive for the users. 
Anyone who needs to traverse `g` can set a script to do so. (maybe we should set one by default? `g = graph.traversal()` ?)"

A bug in TinkerPop serialization allowed tests in the IO suite to pass previously when the probably shouldn't have.  Still not completely sure how they passed at all in previous runs, but they were (some magic in jackson data-bind that i haven't been able to decipher by rolling through the source code).  The deserializer became necessary when embedded types for Long values were not serializing properly into the primitive long values on RelationIdentifier.  Again, not sure how/why this worked prior to the bug fix, but the bug fix established the failure pattern soooo, had to be fixed somehow.  I decided to change the serializer as well when type embedding because of how deeply verbose the id was.  having those individual bits of the RelationIdentifier as a map didn't seem all that useful and the verbosity when embedding ""java.lang.Long"" was a bit much.  It is no simplified via toString().  The only thing that's fishy is that the deserializer didn't require override of the deserialize method that included the TypeSerializer argument.  Kinda expected that to be there, but none of the tests triggered its execution, so that remains mysterious as well.  Anyway, tests all pass at this point so it's likely that everything is working nicely at this point even though there are some unanswered questions."

Cassandra|HBaseInputFormat created a TitanVertexDeserializer, which in
turn created a StandardTitanGraph.  However, individual RecordReaders

Prior to this commit, an IDAuthority.getIDBlock call that threw an

progress for the rest of its lifetime.  After the first
timeout/exception, StandardIDPool would never attempt another call to
IDAuthority.getIDBlock.  This commit changes StandardIDPool to let it
start a new call to IDAuthority.getIDBlock following an
exception/timeout.

This also fixes the test just introduced in

There is no backoff logic introduced in this commit.  The assumption
is that the IDAuthority implementation will contain a reasonable
amount of backoff logic (e.g. BackendOperation.execute).

TitanFactory.open if some of the options are nonlocal.  However,
org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.structure.GraphConstructionTest's method
shouldMaintainOriginalConfigurationObjectGivenToFactory requires that
TBT/STG.configuration return a (possibly improper) superset of the
configuration passed to the open method.

I changed GraphDatabaseConfiguration to retain the ReadConfiguration

I used to get around this problem with shading for test purposes, but
7b3de6c84b55f869f087ae3a67379a1b54aad8a7 broke that strategy by
leaking code exclusive to Guava 15.0+ into core.  Now all ID
allocations fail with NoSuchMethodError on Stopwatch.createStarted
when I use the old HBase 0.94 + Guava 14 test setup.

Now that it's broken and I'm trying to run TTL tests in every module
that supports them, I need to revisit it.  HBase 0.94 refuses to start
without Guava's NullOutputStream, which was removed in 15.0.
NullOutputStream is a simple and tiny little class with no
intrapackage dependencies.  It's 39 lines including license header.
Tentatively, this seems to be all HBase 0.94 server needs added onto
Guava 15.0 to startup and server queries for test purposes.  It's
impossible to exhaustively test this, since we're not realistically
going to have full coverage through both Titan's code and all of the
HBase 0.94 code it would exercise in production."

The assumption that 0 TTL means no TTL has been set is already several
places in the code.  For instance, I've seen it as a constant
parameter given to a method that returns a TTL (used as the default
value) and as a default return in the else block of an if statement.
The code also does not respond well to negative or null values for at
least two reasons: Durations must be nonnegative, so any leak of -1
into a Duration implementation throws an exception, and nulls can
eventually lead to runtime exceptions when doing stuff like
element.value(""~ttl"").

I think -1 expresses ""no TTL"" more naturally than 0, but not by a wide
margin, and catching all the places where 0 is assumed looks quite
tricky.  Not worth it.

dalaro,2015-04-28 23:01:24,https://api.github.com/repos/thinkaurelius/titan/git/commits/baf297da41c887a167abc9c9141f25d7993d9ff4,baf297da41c887a167abc9c9141f25d7993d9ff4,"TTL: method rename, condition tweak, add comments

The only substantial change in this commit is narrowing one condition
in KCVSLogManager's constructor.  Prior to this commit, the condition
assumed that StoreFeatures.hasCellTTL implied
!StoreFeatures.hasStoreTTL.  This is true for all of the storage
backends we have today, and even if it weren't true, it wouldn't
result in incorrect operation, but it's still not necessarily true in
general.  Changed condition to check for StoreFeatures.hasCellTTL &&
!StorFeatures.hasStoreTTL, which was the original intent.

The other changes are just cosmetic:

* Added some comments

* Removed a redundant precondition in TTLKCVSManager's constructor

* Renamed TTLKCVSManager's supportsStoreTTL method to supportsAnyTTL.
  This is better because the method's return value is actually cellTTL
  || storeTTL... it's confusing to name that supportsStoreTTL when it
  really means ""supportsCellOrStoreTTL""."

This commit has two main objectives:

* Rewrite the user-facing API for configuring and submitting reindex
  or index-removal MapReduce jobs so that all MapReduce job
  functionality is hidden behind an `updateIndex` method with a
  signature identical to that in TitanManagement.  Only the
  implementation differs.  Compare with the old user-facing API that
  had bunch of different methods for each backend and job combination.

* Unhardcode Backend.EDGESTORE_NAME in the HBase and Cassandra
  MapReduce InputFormats.  This is now configurable.  It defaults to
  EDGESTORE_NAME, but it can be set to other CF names when the job
  needs it (e.g. Backend.INDEXSTORE_NAME for an index-removal job on a
  graph index)"

This commit makes two tweaks to StandardSerializer:

* Add serializer for ConflictAvoidanceMode enum (ordinal 57)

* Replace serializer keyed by the StandardTimepoint datatype with the
  Timepoint interface it implements; tweak normalizeDataType method to
  treat incoming StandardTimepoint instances as though they were
  Timepoint

This commit also tweaks existing ConfigOptions to either use a
supported StandardSerializer type, or, in titan-es and
titan-cassandra, to serialize a String and manually convert it back
into an enum using ConfigOption.getEnumValue.

ZeroDuration was deleted to simplify StandardSerializer.
ZeroDuration.INSTANCE has been replaced by StandardDuration.ZERO.
Having all implementations of Duration inside core be of concrete type
StandardDuration simplifies things in StandardSerializer (no need for
another hack like that for Timepoint described above, nor for
general-case ""find a known serializer for a compatible non-Object
supertype"" logic).

found new dependency convergence errors as we fixed compile errors in
titan09 following the TP3M7->M8 upgrade.  In both cases, I chose the
later version without any due diligence.  This is less scary than my
prior related commit in this vein, since the major versions aren't
changing in either case.

reduces the odds of accidentally overwriting the file with nonsense,
but it also provides no clean way for third-party implementors to add
mappings.  I don't think centralizing this information in a file is
the way we want to approach custom shorthands anyway.  Removing the
custom shorthand feature and making the index and storage backend
mappings immutable again.

This commit does not affect the standard shorthands.  For example,
""cassandra"" is still a valid shorthand.

There are two related but distinct logical changes in this commit:

* Changed the list of index and storage backends from immutable to
  mutable collections to allow provision of custom shorthand->class
  mappings for third-party backends.

* Made Backend look at a fully-qualified resource name instead of just
  loading the resource named ""titan.properties"", which is such a
  natural filename for a user's config that it tends to cause
  conflicts.  TitanConstants already used a fully-qualified
  packagename when looking up this resource, but Backend didn't.  Also
  renamed the resource file from ""titan.properties"" to
  ""titan.internal.properties"".

This is a workaround for #893 that's likely to avoid race conditions
related to small tx-cache-size values in practice, though it does not
technically eliminate the underlying problem.

Prior to this commit, I investigated an alternative approach involving
WeakReference and a consuming ReferenceQueue drained from the same
thread that touches GuavaVertexCache, and that passed Titan's tests
appeared to log all the right things via slf4j, but it's still too
scary right to introduce so close to a release milestone.  The
assumption required to make that WeakReference approach work is that
dirty vertices are at all times reachable via at least one strong
reference *outside* GVC (on any GC root), but it's not completely
trivial to prove this for all of Titan's internals.  It's also
impossible to write a watertight test for the WeakReference approach
since its behavior is inextricably linked with GC.

StandardTitanTx using a key-consistent backend config (i.e. Cassandra
QUORUM) inside each retrieve method to perform schema reads.  Those
methods also disabled cache on a transaction just before the schema
reads.  However, they disabled cache on the wrong tx -- when I
introduced a a new key-consistent tx to these methods for schema
reads, I failed to move the disableCache invocation from the old tx to
the new key-consistent one.

Now cache is disabled on the actual StandardTitanTx used for the
schema schema vertex/relation read

This commit modifies ConsistentKeyLocker and its superclass to
implement the new behavior expected in
6ea5ebf8d0b13c025d08a4734037fb725d0e089c.  Previously, a lock that
expired while a transaction was holding it would throw a cryptic
TemporaryLockingException with the message ""No lock columns found for
KeyColumn [k=foo, c=bar]"".  This is not a helpful exception in most
cases; the log for ConsistentKeyLocker emits a WARN about the expired
lock shortly before this is thrown, but it would be better to have a
specific exception type and message to make it clearer about what's
happening in this case.

Now we have ExpiredLockException.  This is a a subclass of
TemporaryLockingException.  The message string used with it is
something like ""Expired lock on KeyColumn [k=foo, c=bar]: raw lock
timestamp 1418915175000000 MICROSECONDS is older than Duration[300000
ms]"".

This introduces a pair of tests around expired lock behavior:

* Check that our own expired locks throw a new ExpiredLockException
  class when checked

* Check that expired locks left behind by other instances, or by the
  current instance but with a different-than-expected write time, do
  not necessarily throw an exception in check (unless they prevent the
  transaction from verifying one or more of its own locks)

Previously, only the latter case was implemented and tested.  The
former case is essentially a special case for #892, wherein we want to
provide a more meaningful exception type and message in the event that
a transaction's locks expire while held.

This commit adds the `graph.kryo-instance-cache` option.  It takes

commit effectively restores the old Kryo caching behavior of
KryoSerializer, where it stored Kryos in a ThreadLocal, and where
those ThreadLocals are not necessarily removed when Titan shuts down.
The CHM setting provides an alternative that, unlike ThreadLocal, is
exposed to synchronization overhead when retrieving cached Kryos, but
which also releases all of its cached Kryo references when the graph
is shutdown.

titan09's unique-instance-id/machine-id generator includes the value
of static AtomicLong on the GraphDatabaseConfiguration class.  This is
incremented each time an instance automatically generates its
unique-instance-id.  Because of this AtomicLong counter, it's no
longer necessary to manually specify unique-instance-id/machine-id
when running multiple Titan instances from the same process, so long
as all of those instances use the same GraphDatabaseConfiguration

multiple instances of the GraphDatabaseConfiguration class are loaded
simultaneously within a single JVM, manually setting
unique-instance-id is still required."

This commit updates titan.sh.  It now calls gremlin-server.sh instead
of attempting (and failing) to call the rexster startup script.

This commit also tidies up the conf directory.  conf has gradually
accreted files from various processes as we've added them to the
distro over time.  Prior to this commit, it held configs for 4
distinct processes (Cassandra, ES, Gremlin-Server, Gremlin-Console)
all mixed together.  I've split the Cassandra, ES, and Gremlin-Server
files into subdirectories.  The Gremlin-Console files (e.g. Titan
config files and remote.yaml) still remain direct children underneath
conf, in the interests of minimizing keystroke tedium in the REPL.
This change involved tweaking the *.in.sh files and ES startup script.

This commit also fixes logging configurations for the processes in the
zip distro.  ES, Cassandra, and Gremlin-Server should each log to
distinct files under the log subdirectory again.

This commit also removes (the last?) rexster anachronisms from the
titan.sh script and file paths."

This commit gets the titan-dist/titan-dist-hadoop-1 module to produce
a usable gremlin-server.sh and gremlin.sh script again.  The
aurelius.titan and tinkerpop.server modules are activated by default.
There are a lot of rough edges: gremlin.sh needs a log4j config
update, the solr config files are of no use under Hadoop 1, the conf
folder is sort of a chaotic mess with a combination of ES + Cassandra
+ client + server files, etc.  It's a baseline commit."

titan-dist now populates $REPO_ROOT/{bin,lib,ext,conf.log} with useful

It still has some stale files (the ""rexhome"" directory is at best an
anachronism now).  The zipfiles are also untested; the Hadoop-2-based
zipfile probably needs to be excluded until upstream support is ready
in TP3."

produce a unmeasurably-small performance gain, if it produces one at
all, so I replaced it with an ordinary private final field.

Added an option to the HBase/Cassandra
InputFormat<NullWritable,VertexWritable> implementations built for TP3
that controls the treatment of Titan's partitioned vertices.  By
default, the presence of a partitioned vertex in the input causes an
exception.  Setting titanmr.input.filter-partitioned-vertices=true
instead drops partitioned vertices and any edges incident on
partitioned vertices, logging each at debug as it is dropped.

This commit also renames several config keys in
TitanHadoopConfiguration and adds a test of the new partitioned vertex
filter setting.  The test code is a bit clumsy since I've tried to
avoid requiring Giraph for the titan-hadoop tests -- this could
probably be streamlined once TP3's MapReduceGraphComputer is
implemented."

The most important change in this commit is replacement of some

steps in the intro again on 0.5 and copy-pasted the output as it
appears today: type=foo no longer appears in `map` output, calling
`map` on a single vertex lists each property on a separate line (used
to be all on one line enclosed by curly braces apparently), and edge
toStrings are formatted slightly differently.  The rest of the changes
should just account for different vertex IDs than used to be assigned
in the getting-started scenario."

This commit follows Marko's recent repackaging of giraph-gremlin into
hadoop-gremlin.  This commit deletes GiraphInputFormat and
GiraphVertexInputFormat.  The logic in these classes is now in
hadoop-gremlin.  Titan just needs to provide an
InputFormat<NullWritable, VertexWritable> that reads vertices from
Titan and produces VertexWritable (a thin wrapper around TinkerVertex
right now).  This has simplified things on the Titan side.

I inadvertently broke this with
1b23ce606090eb7e9407e63e26bf8e4e2418ac42.  Prior to that commit,
gremlin.sh passed the ""-l FOO"" arguments into the Console main class,
but the Console main class ignored them.  That commit made the Console
main class stop ignoring them and try to interpret ""-l"" as the path to
an init file.

This commit tweaks gremlin.sh to shift those ""-l FOO"" arguments off
the bottom of the positional parameter set after processing, so that
they aren't passed to the Console main class.

The purpose of this commit is twofold:

* Centralize HBase version management.  The target 0.98.x version was
  duplicated in several places prior to this commit.  Now the
  top-level pom property ${titan098.core.version} specifies the HBase
  0.98 version (without the -hadoop2 suffix), which is appended in

* Update to the latest HBase bugfix releases.  0.98 moved from .2 and
  .3 to .8, and 0.94 moved from .21 to .25.  0.96 does not appear to
  have new upstream bugfixes and stays at .2.

This is for #743 and #762.

This commit does a couple of related things.  I could probably pull
them into separate commits with some effort and additional testing to
make sure the split was clean, but they've been gradually maturing in
my git-stash for a while as a single changeset anyway.

1. The ""filesystem"" assembly descriptor, which copies files to the
   root of the repo (like bin/gremlin.sh) for testing during
   development, now just includes a component called ""common"" and
   nothing else.  The ""archive"" assembly descriptor, which builds the
   zipfiles, also includes this component, plus a second for
   html/javadocs and a third for the readme-style text files in the
   root of the archive.  This change eliminated the copy-paste
   duplication between the zipfile and root-of-dev-repo assemblies.
   The clean goal has also been updated to delete up rexhome and
   examples in the root of the repo, since the filesystem descriptor
   now includes those via the common component.  This fixes #762.

2. The sample Titan conf files now pass through an additional
   preprocessor called ConfigurationFileFilter.  This replaces lines
   of the form #TITANCFG{key=value} with a word-wrapped multi-line
   comment including information from the ConfigOption associated with
   key, including the description, default value, data type, and
   mutability.  For mutabilities FIXED, GLOBAL_OFFLINE, and GLOBAL,
   there's also an tip to use the Management System API and reminder
   that changes to the value in the file have no effect after Titan is
   first started.  After this comment appears the actual key=value
   pair on a line by itself.

   After ConfigurationFileFilter has completely processed the input
   file and written to a separate output file, it opens and reads the
   separate output file with ConfigurationLint.  ConfigurationLint
   checks that the file parses as a PropertiesConfiguration and that
   every key is associated with a Titan ConfigOption.  Furthermore,
   this commit extends ConfigurationLint to execute the verification
   predicate defined in each ConfigOption on its associated value in
   the separate output file.  This serves as a sanity check on
   ConfigurationFileFilter.  If ConfigurationFileFilter or
   ConfigurationLint find an error and exit with nonzero status, the
   build fails.

   This addresses #743.

   I could have probably figured out how to do all this with Velocity,
   but my aims were modest and I couldn't quickly figure out how to
   extend Velocity quite this way, so I just wrote this little utility
   program.

The core logic for the new MapReduce-backed ScanJob executor is in
HadoopScanMapper.  HadoopScanRunner is a companion class with a helper
method that programmatically starts a single MR Job setup to run a
ScanJob with its Configuration passed as parameters to the helper
method.  The new test is CassandraScanJobTest, which runs the same
SimpleScanJob test code used by KCVSTest, except against Cassandra +
MapReduce + Hadoop 1/2 (both versions of the test are passing as of
this commit).

Related changes in this commit:

* Refactored the SimpleScanJob test in KeyColumnValueStoreTest.
  SimpleScanJob itself has been pulled up to a non-inner public class
  for reuse.  The test logic inside the scanTestWithSimpleJob method
  has been moved a static method on SimpleScanJob to allow the
  MapReduce-backed test to reuse it more easily.  Likewise, the
  loadValues method that prepares data fixtures required by the
  SimpleScanJob have been moved to static methods on
  KeyColumnValueStoreUtil to allow reuse by MapReduce.

* Made SimpleScanJob use the Configuration argument passed to its
  setup method for initialization, and added a crude hex serialization
  for its slicequery bounds.  Its modular arithmetic parameters
  involving vertex IDs are just serialized using the existing logic
  for numbers in the config impls.  Passing configuration around this
  way instead of doing it through construction is necessary for
  MapReduce where the submitting process is not in general the same as
  the executing process.  The alternative is to create a concrete
  subclass containing config parameters for every little cfg change,
  and this looked like a mess in the scanTestWithSimpleJob method when
  I tried it out.

* Separated job and graph configs in StandardScanner.  Formerly, one
  configuration was used for both purposes, but there's no reason to
  assume that the ScanJob uses GraphDatabaseConfiguration.ROOT_NS as
  its config root like Titan proper does.  Aside from the obviously
  related files, this change also touches one line in OLAPTest.

* Updated the titan-hadoop-parent/pom.xml to run the new MapReduce
  test at the appropriate surefire stage (when Cassandra's configs are
  in place)

* Added a basic ArrayList-extending implementation of EntryList that
  returns a wild guess for its heap usage.  The binary input formats
  still return Iterable<Entry>; this should probably change to a type
  that offers more of the capability in the underlying datastructures
  returned by HBase/Cassandra.

* Added some Hadoop1/2 compat code related to counters (the MR
  ScanMetrics implementation uses Counters).

This commit includes an unfinished (and completely untested)
HadoopVertexScanMapper.  The configuration setup in that class still
needs some work before it can be tested."

This commit adds an HBase VertexInputFormat similar to the one
introduced for Cassandra in 5a9ed8ef8590190deb8085c33984906bc4e7190b.
Both formats (and titan-hadoop in general) are tightly coupled to
TinkerGraph and loosely coupled to GiraphComputeVertex.

This titan-hadaoop change only been tested on HBase 0.98.3-hadoop1.

This commit also modifies TitanGremlinPlugin to pull in
hbase-{client,common,server} version 0.98.3-hadoop1, which is a
complete hack for testing and not the right way to manage that
dependency.  hbase-server is needed only for HBase's TableInputFormat."

This commit removes:

* FakeVertex and associated Frames-based test in
  TitanGraphSerialSpeedTest

* GraphGenerator.  This was really just a thin wrapper around the
  power law graph generator in an old alpha version of Furnace.
  TitanGraphSerialSpeedTest continues to use a graphml file produced
  by GraphGenerator a while ago (titan-test/data/v10k.graphml.gz);
  only the generator that produced it is deleted in this commit.

* The alpha Furnace code in titan-test (used only by GraphGenerator)

I shortened ""SerialSpeedTest"" to just ""SpeedTest"" in the classes where
it appears.  I also renamed the ludicrously vague ""Schema"" class used
by the (Serial)SpeedTest to SerialSpeedTestSchema and moved it into
the same package and folder that uses it.  It's now a Groovy class.

I temporarily commented the body and imports of TitanIndexTest so that
I could get titan-test to run its Grooovy compiler.  Then I updated a
couple of imports (e.g. BP 2.5 Vertex is now TP3 structure.Vertex).
The (Serial)SpeedTest groovy code compiles now:

[INFO] --- gmaven-plugin:1.5:compile (groovy-compile) @ titan-test ---
[INFO] Compiled 18 Groovy classes

It probably has runtime failures, but at it shouldn't cause compile
errors or get in the way of updating & compiling other code in
titan-test to TP3.

TitanIndexTest is not modified in this commit.  I only commented it in
my working copy so that Maven would stop choking on it and run the
gmaven-plugin compilation step."

ConcurrentHashMaps with no awareness of Titan schema.  FSM.getRelation
delegates to a helper class that knows about Titan's ManagementSystem
API when a retrieval on one of the maps misses.  However, the subtype
helper getters did not delegate.  This led to a confusing NPE in
TitanHadoopGraph.readHadoopVertex's call to

FSM's helper class, but FSM was ignoring it.  I think this was
unintentional, since the contains methods on FSM also consult the

Based on some feedback, I wanted a file templating facility that would
let me both automatically annotate settings in the stock config files
with ConfigOption information (like the description string and
mutability level), but also do more pedestrian templating tasks, like
including other files.

The ConfigOption bit is probably possible with Velocity, but it seemed
non-trivial or clumsy enough to implement with VTL that I just wrote a
one-file tool to do the job instead."

This commit disables the maxTotal parameter on the connection pool.
The connection pool size is now regulated through the maxActive and
maxIdle parameters on the pool.  Setting maxTotal appears to cause
commons-pool to repeatedly just barely exceed the limit by one
connection, then close 15% of the total pool size before repeating the
process.  The overall number of connections stays at or just one over
the configured limit, which is good, but routinely closing and
reopening connections can lead to a tens of thousands of TIME_WAIT
sockets in test scenarios with just one client and one server on the
same physical host, which is bad.

Keeping maxTotal off (negative) and using the active and idle limits
instead seems to avoid this behavior.  I've seen this before when
testing Titan-Hadoop and worked around it there by overridding the
defaults just for the affected Titan-Hadoop testsd.  Now I'm seeing it
again in ThriftGraphTest's getSlice stress tests, and I'm changing the
defaults instead of just working around it in a specific test config."

This commit adds support for HBase's authentication token system,
which is required for MapReduce (Titan-Hadoop/Faunus) jobs that want
to talk to a Kerberized HBase instance.

This commit has no effect on Kerberized HBase authentication outside
of MapReduce/Titan-Hadoop/Faunus, which works as described in the
HBase manual.

This commit was tested on CentOS 5, RHEL 6, and MIT Kerberos 1.8.x.
The Titan-Hadoop HBase read and write logic use different code and
config keys.  The read path uses HBase's own input format and config
keys, while the write path uses a custom format brought in with
Faunus.

When writing without HBase configuration files (including
hbase-site.xml) on the classpath of the MR tasks, the Titan-Hadoop
config setting
titan.hadoop.output.conf.ext.hbase.security.authentication should be
set to Kerberos.  This tells the HBaseStorageManager that starts up
inside the Titan-Hadoop write path to check for a Kerberos
authentication delegation token.  If an hbase-site.xml containing the
hbase.security.authentication=kerberos setting is on the MR task
classpath, then there's no need to duplicate it in the Titan-Hadoop
config file like this.

The read path just needs that setting on the submitting process's
classpath."

Since this method is part of the Blueprints API, it should probably
return null instead of throwing IllegalArgumentException for the
(Titan-specific rather than Blueprints-standardized) range of IDs
which are outside the legal vertex ID space.  This commit changes the
exception type thrown in IDManager.getUserVertexIDType to
InvalidIDException, which inherits from TitanException and in turn
RuntimeException.  StandardTitanTx.getVertex catches
InvalidIDException, logs a warning, and then returns null.

I think nothing needs to be done to make bogus schema vertex IDs
return null, since they follow a different logic path in
IDManager.getKey that just converts the long into a byte buffer.  Not
sure though."

This is for #473

This commit adds new tests and release scripts and pom snippets to
support automatic forward-compatibility test cases.  Each time Titan
releases, it now loads GraphOfTheGods into BDB+ES, then zips the
BDB+ES files into an archive and uploads it to S3.  The release
process also appends the HTTP URL pointing to the zipfile in S3, along
with a couple of other metadata fields, to the compat.csv file created
in this commit.  All subsequent releases iterate over the lines in
this file and check that the current release can open and query the
copy of GotG created by that old version.  The open+query test is uses
Expect and borrows queries from the Getting Started section of the
docs.

I initially tried to tie all of this into maven-release-plugin's
configuration, but I ran into limitations around committing files
during release:prepare:

https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MRELEASE-798

I added a new helper script, commit-compat-version.sh, and updated
RELEASING.md accordingly.  However, RELEASING.md has accumulated quite
a few steps.  It's up to seven just to stage the release artifacts and
stop just short of releasing Sonatype to Central and pushing commits
and tags to github.  I created a new script to automate these steps
named release.sh.  This prompts the user to update
titan.compatible.versions, then carries out all of the release steps
through `mvn deploy`.  It stops just short of the point of no return;
it doesn't push commits/tags to github or release artifacts to
Central.

I tested this by locally running the release steps for 0.5.1 and
0.5.2, but skipping the points of no return and deleting the staged
artifacts after testing.

I lost count of how many times I amended this commit before pushing."

The config key for the incremental loading groovy script is currently
titan.hadoop.output.loader-script-file.  It should contain one or more
of the following methods:

* getOrCreateVertex(FaunusVertex, TitanGraph, Context, Logger)
* getOrCreateVertexProperty(TitanProperty, TitanVertex,

The first method should return a TitanVertex and the last should
return a TitanEdge.  The return type of the middle method is currently
ignored.  In practice, the TitanProperty-typed parameter to the middle
method is always of the more specific FaunusProperty subtype, but
making this explicit would require a cast and doesn't seem to lend
additional functionality.  Might revisit this.

This is a new approach to avoiding gremlin.sh hangs after quit/exit by
Titan's embedded Cassandra instance leaving non-daemon background
threads running.  CassandraDaemonWrapper no longer attempts to stop
CassandraDaemon, which doesn't kill the all of the non-daemon threads
anyway.  Instead, gremlin.sh's main calls System.exit right before
returning, forcing JVM shutdown, which, among other things, fires the
shutdown hook registered by Cassandra during startup and terminates
all of its non-daemon background threads.

This is not ideal, since it's possible that the shutdown hook will not
run or that the process will prematurely terminate before the hook
completes, in which case Cassandra may lose writes which haven't yet
been synced to the commitlog (in periodic-sync mode).

However, it's still preferable to the alternatives I've found so far.
CassandraDaemon.stop does not actually kill all of the background
threads, and my previous approach to this problem in
CassandraDaemonWrapper was essentially just a defective version of the
shutdown hook installed by Cassandra at startup (although it did have
the benefit of running without shutdown hook time and resource
constraints).

This seems to behave both in titan-cassandra unit tests and the
titan-dist integration tests, so I'm going to give it a shot on
titan05."

when SSL is enabled, `makeRawConnection` forgoes the constructor in

attempting to reopen it throws an exception.

This commit adds subclasses of AstyanaxStoreTest and ThriftStoreTest
that run all the same test logic, except with SSL enabled in the store
manager configuration.  Since cassandra.yaml needs certain config
options set to enable SSL and point it at its keystore, this also
required changes to the test harness.  The pom got new executions of
the resources and surefire plugins; these filter SSLized
cassandra.yaml into target/cassandra/conf/localhost-murmur-ssl/ and
also copy (without resource filtering) a truststore and keystore to
the same directory.  The keystore is used by cassandra.yaml and the
truststore is used by the Titan configurations in AstyanaxSSLStoreTest
and ThriftSSLStore_Test.

The Astyanax test passes, but the Thrift test fails due to multiple
bugs in the CTConnectionFactory.makeRawConnection's SSL logic.  It
should be calling setTrustStore instead of setKeyStore, and it needs
to check whether the transport is already open before trying to open
it."

This commit doesn't change the way ConfigOptions are read or written
to account for deprecation.  That's still the responsibility of client
code.  I didn't want to further complicate the config subsystem with
that, at least not yet.

This commit does add a new constructor that accepts a ""deprecatedBy""
option of type ConfigOption, indicating that the option under
construction is deprecated in favor of the arrgument.
ConfigurationPrinter checks for this and formats deprecated options
differently; it draws their names with strikethrough and prepends a
red ""Deprecated by..."" warning to the struckthrough name.  Necessary
CSS and docbook tweaks also included in this commit.

This could be theoretically be extended so that BasicConfiguration
(and others?) are aware of deprecation and will favor the successor
option when it is set automatically, or to issue warnings.  I don't
want to tackle those quite yet.  Warnings are also harder than they
sound, since we don't want to constantly spam the log with them if a
certain piece of Titan repeatedly reads a deprecated option from its
config."

customized their mapred-site.xml and core-site.xml under their

raises the potential to silently mask the user's preferred mapred- or

Fix #702

Lead up to this commit:

TitanTransaction.addVertex(VertexLabel) and addVertex(String) both
take a vertex label argument.  TitanBlueprintsTransaction and TBGraph
define addVertex(Object).  The Object overload doesn't contain any
implementation logic by itself; it does instanceof checks on the
argument and calls another addVertex overload based on what it finds.
If the argument is a String, it calls the
TitanTransaction.addVertex(String vertexLabel) overload.

This behavior is incompatible with Blueprints.  Calling loadGraphML
(which in turn uses BP GraphMLReader and BatchGraph) on a file just
containing <node id=""1""/> results in Blueprints calling
TitanTransaction.addVertex(Object) with the String ""1"".  Titan sees
that the argument is a String and attempts to interpret ""1"" as a
vertex label.  However, the implicit contract/intent on the Blueprints
side was to have ""1"" interpreted as a user-assigned ID (or, in the
specific case of Titan, to have Titan ignore that ID argument entirely
and self-assign an ID).

This commit renames the two TitanTransaction.addVertex methods that
take a vertex label to addVertexWithLabel.  It also modifies
TitanBlueprintsTransaction.addVertex(Object) to ignore arguments of
type String.  Now only addVertex arguments of type Number or
VertexLabel are considered by Titan.  Arguments of other types are
ignored."

The vast majority of ES-backed tests work fine with local-mode where
ES runs embedded and does not accept sockets.  However, this does not
work well with Faunus.  Running many short-lived map or reduce tasks,
each with its own embedded ES instance running in local-mode tends to
cause a wave of unclean ES shutdowns.  Starting a backgrounded ES
daemon in an external process and then running Faunus + Titan + ES
tests against that external process is cleaner.

This commit introduces a Java utility class that starts and stops an
external ES daemon to support Faunus tests.  The daemon writes a
pidfile /tmp/titan-test-es.pid and writes data to
titan-es/target/es-data.  The config and scripts are lifted from the
ES 1.2.1 distribution.  Some of the pom glue and utility class code
are adapted from similar previous work in titan-hbase.

The recently introduced CassandraESReindexTest class already requires
an external ES daemon to succeed.  This commit just adds automated
tooling to provide one and adds a @BeforeClass to
CassandraESReindexTest that uses it."

This commit should ideally be split up into smaller commits, but
overlapping changes in titan-dist/pom.xml made that difficult.

This commit fixes the existing Expect-based tests, all of which were
broken before this commit.  There were a couple of problems:

1. Vertex IDs assigned by Titan during even trivial gremlin.sh
examples have changed since the Expect tests were originally written,
so that the current vertex IDs disagree with the constants embedded in
the Expect scripts.  I replaced all of those constant vertex ID
expectations with regexes for nonnegative integers.

2. A mismatch between the config files generated in titan-dist/pom.xml
and the default config files used by CassandraStorageSetup prevented
Cassandra from even starting

Both of these are fixed.

This commit also adds three new tests of Faunus:

* graphson->cassandra, shutdown, then cassandra->graphson
* graphson->hbase, shutdown, then hbase->graphson
* graphson->graphson

The Cassandra tests run once on BOP and then again on Murmur.  The
HBase tests run against whatever HBase version is in the zipfile
(currently: 0.98).  The tests start HBase automatically using the test
harness in titan-hbase-parent.

This commit also disables batch-loading in the default
titan-hbase-output.properties and titan-cassandra-output.properties
files shipped in the zipfile.  This is a temporary workaround for the
schema inferencer not forcing batch-loading off.

This commit also adds hbase-server to the zipfile dependency tree.
The zipfile was originally written with 0.94, which just had a single
artifact named ""hbase"".  0.96 and 0.98 are split between the
""hbase-client"" and ""hbase-server"" artifacts, and HBase's MapReduce
input format ships in the latter.  Failing to include it in the
zipfile produced ClassNotFoundException when attempting to use the
HBase input format.

Several sample Faunus config files included in the zipfile contain a
path to ./graph-of-the-gods.json.  I changed this to
example-data/graph-ofthe-gods.json, so that the example files work
without any modification or file copying when using MapReduce's local
(in-process) job runner and directly accessing the local filesystem.

The modification to the root-level pom.xml file resolves a dependency
conflict between rexster and hbase-server over grizzly2's exact
version number."

Prior to this commit, Faunus's HBase input format would fail to read
from a Titan database written with short-cf-names=true (currently the
default), since it just assumed that long CF names were in use.

This commit suggests future refactoring.  Hiding the mapping between
short and long names inside HBaseStoreManager a private datastructure
prevents TitanHBaseInputFormat from reading it.  Either the mapping
needs to become public, or we would need to change the type of CF
names from String to an enum or some interface that can supply both
the short and long name through a pair of methods."

TitanGraphOutputMapReduce has a static helper that constructs a
configuration with some default settings commonly used in testing.
These are Cassandra specific, which doesn't really belong in the
store-agnostic TitanGraphOutputMapReduce class anyway, but moving it
is a task for a future commit.  This commit just modifies the
default-setting logic to avoid an NPE when cassandra.yaml is not
available as a classloader resource in the same package as
TitanCassandraInputFormat.  That's still the first place it looks, but
if it comes up null, it tries the system classloader, and if that
comes up null, then it does not attempt to set a default value for the
cassandra.yaml path."

execute the method overload defined in the subclass twice (not once in

ConfigOptions store a type token representing the class or interface

the type token by calling defaultValue.getClass().  Calling getClass()

which is likely to be an inner class identifier like EnumName$1.  This
is almost always not what the writer intended.

We might be able to change ConfigOption's constructor to check whether
the default value belongs to an enum, and then try to get the enum
class, but I'm not sure it's worth the complexity.  The user can
always specify the intended type token by invoking another constructor
overload.  I've done the latter with TIMESTAMP_PROVIDER.

This commit makes two changes in titan-all's dependency tree:

1. titan-all now depends on hbase-client 0.98.2-hadoop2.  Before, it
   didn't depend on an hbase/hbase-client version, relying on the user
   to set one or exclude the titan-hbase module in their own pom.
   titan-all now sets a default version to avoid
   NoClassDefFoundErrors.  Downstream poms can override or exclude it
   as desired.

2. titan-all now explicitly declares dependencies on the Jackson 1.x
   and 2.y artifacts that it indirectly uses.  titan-all doesn't
   directly use Jackson, but its transitive deps do.  Furthermore,
   those transitive deps brought in a combination of 1.8 and 1.9 jars,
   and this led to NoClassDefFoundErrors at runtime.  Now titan-all
   sets all the affected artifacts to the same version declared in
   dependencyManagement.

   Importing dependencyManagement might be the cleaner approach:

   http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies

   However, I'm wary of imposing additional requirements on downstream
   poms that want to use titan-all.  Also, I don't know whether
   dependencyManagement imports work on non-Maven tools that parse
   poms, such as gradle or sbt.  The approach in this commit is
   stupider than dependencyManagement imports but also simpler and
   should work regardless of the tool manipulating the downstream pom."

Related: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/aureliusgraphs/FD5cKy72h7Y

ReflectiveConfigOptionLoader walks the classpath at startup, looking
for static ConfigOption fields to initialize.  titan-all depends on
titan-hbase, but it leaves declaration of an hbase-client dependency
to the user.  titan-hbase's classes won't actually link without an
hbase-client jar available.  If the user doesn't provide one, then
ReflectiveConfigOptionLoader will walk over HBaseStoreManager's
ConfigOption fields and die with linkage errors on org.apache.hbase
when trying to load HBaseStoreManager and initialize its fields.

ReflectiveConfigOptionLoader now catches and warns on linkage errors
it encounters while walking the classpath instead of propagating them
up the stack.

titan-all still needs to depend on hbase-client.  Right now,
declaration of a dependency on hbase-client is left up to the user;
this is too brittle.  Better to set a dependency on some version than
none at all, leading to classpath problems if the user doesn't declare
an HBase dep.  That will happen in a follow-up commit."

Prior to this commit, titan-hbase's javadoc jar was built by copying
the source files for the titan-hbase-core and -09X modules into a
single directory, then invoking maven-javadoc-plugin on the directory.
This worked, but maven-javadoc-plugin would fill the console with
scary-looking though harmless warnings since it couldn't resolve any
of the imports in the source files.  The point of this commit is
basically to avoid those warnings.  The titan-hbase javadoc jar is now
built via an assembly that unpacks the titan-hbase-core javadoc.  This
is kind of a downgrade, since the javadoc no longer includes the
compat shim classes in the titan-hbase-09X modules, but there's not
much interesting content to javadoc in there anyway.  We could get
them back by creating yet another module, but we already have so
many...

The titan-hbase source jar is now generated by an assembly that
unpacks the source jars from titan-hbase-core and the -09X compat
modules."

This commit fixes a failsafe integration test failure in
TitanCassandraOutputFormatTest#testBulkEdgeDerivations that occurred
on titan-hadoop-2 but not on titan-hadoop-1.  The link step was
failing with an NPE when attempting to read the traversal direction
from the config under H2 (but succeeding under H1).  I think this is
due to the way Hadoop2Compiler handles job configuration; it sets
custom config keys, including the traversal direction for link steps,
on the reducer and mapper but not on the combiner.  This commit tries
to pull the custom config keys up to the job level so that they're
inherited by the combiner as well as the reducer and mapper.  At
least, I think that's what's going on -- not 100% confident I've got
the analysis correct, even though the fix seems to work."

This commit introduces a ConfigNamespace and several ConfigOptions to
titan-hadoop and replaces several hardcoded string keys scattered
around the code with ConfigOption uses.

This is not a complete migration away from Hadoop Configuration.  A
few of the unresolved issues:

* Hadoop Configuration's setClass(String key, Class impl, Class iface)
  method does not have an exact equivalent in the titan-core
  configuration API.  It could be modeled with ConfigOptions
  parameterized in a composite value representing a pair of impl and
  iface, but that's not ideal.

* Hadoop Configurations are unavoidable when working with MR, so I
  took the approach extending Hadoop's Configured base class with a
  HybridConfigured subclass that maintains both a Hadoop Configuration
  and read-only Titan configuration backed by the Hadoop
  Configuration.  All writes currently have to go though the Hadoop
  Configuration though, and that's cumbersome in some places.

* Several input and output format-specific options haven't been
  migrated to ConfigOption at all (e.g. rdf and edgelist options)"

This is technically inferior to the strategy used prior to this
commit.  That approach had no titan-hadoop-core module.  The
titan-hadoop-1 and titan-hadoop-2 modules shared each used the build
helper plugin to add a common source directory to the build path, so
that they had one directory containing hadoop1/2-specific sources and
also had the common source directory.  The titan-hadoop-1 and -2
modules compiled every source file using their target Hadoop library
version.  This is nice because it precludes classfile linkage errors
at runtime, but the downside is that neither Eclipse m2e nor IDEA are
capable of comprehending this Maven configuration, rendering them
little more than red-colored text editors on the modules in question.

Contrast this with the approach in this commit, where
titan-hadoop-core is compiled against a Hadoop 2 jar, and it's on us
to keep out IncompatibleClassChange-inducing ABI incompatibilites.
This raises the possibility of runtime classfile linkage errors, but
the upshot is that both Eclipse and IDEA can understand it.

This commit makes a few other changes:

* deleted BlueprintsGraphOutputMapReduce and replaced calls to its
  static methods with equivalent static calls on
  TitanGraphOutputMapReduce

* deleted BlueprintsGraphOutputMapReduceTest; there is some test logic
  in here that would be nice to port to Titan, but replacing
  TinkerGraph with Titan without breaking/rewriting the test seemed
  nontrivial

* Shortened some config keys:
  titan.hadoop.graph.input.titan  -> titan.hadoop.input
  titan.hadoop.graph.output.titan -> titan.hadoop.output

The config changes are barely tested.  The config keys are probably
going to get tweaked again in the future to fit them into a
ConfigNamespace and/or to avoid potential collisions with other keys
in the titan.hadoop.graph.input prefix (e.g. ""location"")."

This commit adds a new test, TitanWritePerformanceTest, which tests
vertex, edge, and property insertion on an empty graph with and
without batch loading enabled.  The code is descended from
TitanGraphPerformanceTest last seen in
7d69240e324cb5c2bef71a25dc88fbead1697308, but it's been refactored to
use BatchGraph and helper methods in TitanGraphTestCommon for schema
creation, and to de-noisify the edge insertion pattern.

This commit removes several performance test classes:

* the two-method ""PerformanceTest"" and the TitanBenchmarkSuite class
  that used it.  There were no external references to these classes;
  the only reference appeared to be a block of commented code in
  TitanBlueprintsTest, which was also removed.

* SpeedComparisonBenchmark, which seems mostly subsumed by other test
  classes (except possibly the VertexList retrieval)

* KeyColumnValueStorePerformance -- this is a good idea, but it
  appears to have been barely started and never really finished.  The
  only subclass in the source tree is for the InMemory backend.
  Deleting it for now since the performance data it produces are not
  useful, but maybe we will restore and flesh it out later.

SerializerTest contained a combination of correctness-focused and
performance-focused tests.  I extracted common logic into
SerializerTestCommon, then moved the performance tests to
SerializerSpeedTest (which also bears the PerformanceTests JUnit
category).  The correctness-focused tests are still in SerializerTest.

This commit adds a new enabled-by-default JUnitBenchmarks reporter
that writes a CSV file with one line per test method.  The reporter is
internally synchronized but it isn't safe for use by concurrent
processes (e.g. multiple surefire test forks).  The file path is
target/jub.csv.  The output includes an initial header row."

The Tokens class formerly loaded a resource named version.txt from the

version.txt is now known as meta.properties, and it contains a
Java-Properties-formatted set of key-value pairs.  The current keys
are version and jobjar.  The latter key is the name of the default
mapred job jar.  Making this dynamic instead of hard-coded allows the
hadoop1 and hadoop2 artifacts to have different job jars without
potential for overwriting or mixups stemming from having two job jars
with identical names but different contents and Hadoop major versions."

This is an attempt to refactor the titan-hadoop module to
transparently support both Hadoop1 and Hadoop2 using a reflective shim

However, this is probably going to be more trouble than it's worth.
There's too much API leakage in titan-hadoop-core; besides Hadoop's
Counter class sustaining incompatible changes between versions,
several of the test classes wont even load in a Hadoop1 CLASSPATH
after being compiled against Hadoop2.  Instead of spending a bunch of
time trying to isolate every incompatible change and move it into the
shims (which is possible but time consuming), I'm probably going to
just produce two different artifacts, one with a hadoop1 classifier

This commit should fix an issue with StandardTitanGraph.commit that
caused transaction conflicts on storage backends with serializable
isolation (but not on backends with weaker isolation guarantees).  It
makes STG.commit only open a secondary transaction for schema
mutations when the backend has weak isolation; when the backend
provides strong isolation, it sticks to a single tx now.

This commit also changes the isolation level used in most of the BDB
tests to serializable (from repeatable read, the default).

This commit still at least two known problems:

* TransactionalTitanGraphTestSuite.testCompetingThreads fails
  spectacularly with BDB configured for serializable isolation

* BerkeleyPartitionGraphTest.testVertexPartitioning
  nondeterministically fails.  These pseudorandom failures predate
  this commit; they are present on the ancestor commit also.  On my
  machine, 33 of 60 successive runs passed while the remaining 27
  failed with a few different assertions, all of which seem related to

more than a pure markup conversion: it also includes a little bit of
editing to attempt to replace references to ""Faunus"" with
""Titan-Hadoop"" or just ""Titan"" if the context already strongly

made sense for Faunus as an independent project (like its own

Separating Faunus from the ScriptEngine implementation turned out to
be non-trivial because Faunus needs a ScriptEngine implementation in
several places: not just for gremlin.sh, but also in ScriptMap and
ScriptInputFormat.  I still don't see a satisfactory way to separate
these concerns short of a major titan-hadoop refactoring, so for now
I'm compromising and just adopting the Faunus ScriptEngine,
ResultHookClosure, ScriptExecutor, etc.

This commit also deletes the shaded titan03 dependencies from
titan-hadoop and reenables maven-enforcer-plugin in the same.  The
shaded jar needs some attention/testing before it makes a return.
Reenabling enforcer in titan-hadoop exposed a couple of unmanaged
dependency versions that are now controlled in the top-level pom."

Now /etc/titan/log4j.properties exists and is respected by Rexster.

This file sets up a rolling file appender with date-and-timestamps.
These stamps include the yyyy-mm-dd date and the time of day to the
milliseconds place.  The default Rexster log4j configuration does not
include any kind of time or datestamp and I think one is sorely needed
for the rpm/deb distribution.

Implementation note: the only way to get Rexster to use a log4j config
is to either put it in a file named ""log4j.properties"" in the current
working directory of the JVM or to pack it in rexster's own jar so
that it will load when Rexster calls
Application.class.getResource(""log4j.properties"").  This behavior is
hardcoded into a static initializer in Rexster's Application class and
it overrides the default log4j configuration mechanism.  I would
rather use the default log4j mechanism but changing Rexster's behavior
is out-of-scope."

Titan's debian and rpm packages now install and run again under Ubuntu
14.04 and CentOS 6.5 respectively. Tested alongside the packages for
ES and Cassandra and they seem to play nicely (1.0.3 and 2.0.7 resp).
Haven't tried to make this play nicely with Hadoop packages from any
distributors, though.

I also tweaked the apt/yum repo generation script to make it a bit
more robust and allow updating one repo type at a time instead of
doing both unconditionally.

The packaging controlfiles/specfiles and attendant scripts are still
setup with `mvn -pl titan-dist -Ppkg-tools install` from the root of
the repo and executed with {debian,redhat}/build.sh or
pkgtools/bin/build-all.sh.

I also did away with subpackages for each of the storage and indexing
backends.  titan-cassandra, titan-hbase, titan-es, ... no longer exist
as separate rpm and deb files; there's just one giant titan package
with all of the backend jars. The maven configuration bits and shell
scripts for generating a partition of titan's dependency tree and a
concomitant set of constellation of little subpackages with
nonoverlapping jar sets will live on in the git history in case we
decide to restore it in the future.  I don't think we want to sign on
to maintain that level of complexity just yet though."

I think this happened because the timestamp used in the ID allocation
write is generated prior to starting the IDAUTHORITY_WAIT timer.  If a
thread generates its timestamp, then gets pulled off core by the OS
scheduler, then gets placed back on a core and proceeds to start the
IDAUTHORITY_WAIT timer, it could potentially end up writing a
timestamp older than IDAUTHORITY_WAIT without triggering a retry.  At
least, that's my best guess for what happened."

During the earliest stages of Titan's test harness development, we
named Cassandra tests with either the prefix ""Internal"" or ""External""
depending on whether the test was responsible for bootstrapping its
own Cassandra instance for testing purposes or whether it could assume
a Cassandra instance was already listening on localhost and the
default Thrift port, respectively.  The Cassandra test harness has
matured since then; the ""External"" test classes have long since been
removed, but the naming scheme left a legacy of superfluous ""Internal""
prefixes all over titan-cassandra's src/test/java.

I've stripped the ""Internal"" anachronism and removed the last mentions
to the External/Internal distinction from the top-level pom.xml.

I also used this opportunity to shorten some of the the obscenely long
Cassandra test class names; for example

  InternalCassandraEmbeddedMultiWriteKeyColumnValueStoreTest

is now just

  EmbeddedMultiWriteStoreTest

The other backends don't have the External/Internal naming
anachronism, but I'm planning to shorten them according to the same
pattern in a subsequent commit."

The most important change in this commit fixes a regression that I
introduced yesterday via 7da161f9d8f2ef9f3384abcc97794df63c00412b.
Specifically, it broke the calculation of the end of MessagePuller's
column slice bounds by allowing them to straddle two timeslices.
Timeslices are mapped 1-to-1 with keys, and each individual
MessagePuller run is only supposed to query one timeslice/key.  The
regression manifested as dropping messages in the broken column slice
belonging that belonged to the later of the two timeslices.

This commit also introduces a bunch of new logging output and a
toString() implementation that I used when investigating the
regression and which will probably be useful in future debugging."

This commit mostly affects read timestamps used by the Cassandra
embedded adapter, which could previously break reads on columns with
TTLs set when Titan was configured for a timestamp resolution other
than milliseconds.

All of the HBase and Cassandra backends should continue to retrieve
the most recent version of rows/columns, regardless of
TransactionHandleConfig.getStartTime().  The notion of start time is
generally not practical when using native HBase and Cassandra
timestamps, since Cassandra only shows the most recent column version
and HBase retains only between 1 and 3 most recent versions under its
default configuration (and may well be configured to retain only 1).

There's also some minor refactoring in DistributedStoreManager; I
renamed ""Timestamp"" to ""MaskedTimestamp"" in an attempt to highlight
this class's sole function, which is to encapsulate some bitmask
operations on otherwise ordinary timestamps.

There is more timestamp refactoring to come after this commit; this
just focuses on some delicate changes in the Cassandra embedded
adapter and refactoring in DistributedStoreManager.(Masked)Timestamp
and its usage sites."

Updated the property key and edge label definition documentation to
address the introduction of TitanManagement/ManagementSystem,
Cardinality, and Multiplicity.

Added a table explaining the Multiplicity effects; I basically just
copied the javadoc for Multiplicity enum values and tried to put them
in a pretty layout.  Added a [NOTE] block pointing out the difference
between SIPMLE and ONE2ONE, which IMHO is not immediately obvious.
Added [NOTE] blocks reminders to call `make()` and to commit the
management system when defining types.  Updated the examples for
defining pkeys/elabels & examples for retrieving and iterating over
types.  Added a new example showing sortKey/sortOrder on property
keys.

I moved the documentation on type definition to the ""Using Titan""
section from the ""Mangement"" section.  I think schema definition is
interesting from the user standpoint, and I'd like to see the
management section become more about server administration,
deployment, integration with other software, etc -- the operational
side.

This commit leaves undone some important stuff in the type
documentation, such as:

* documenting the new method of creating indices with
  TitanManagement/ManagementSystem

* documenting the new way of expressing uniqueness through an argument
  to the index creation method

* a migration guide (not too fancy -- maybe a table or bulleted list)
  showing equivalents of old 0.4 type creation idioms in the new 0.5
  API

I also left several TODO comments where I'd like to fact-check the
docs or expand an example."

Added a primitive highlighter for Gremlin that just highlights the
""gremlin>"" prompt, the return value prefix ""==>"", string literals, and
comments.  In a future revision, I would like to teach the highlighter
to recognize Gremlin language functions like g.V and map, but this is
a start.

This config includes a local file:/// path that's only valid on my
system (in titansingle.xsl).  This is due to a limitation in xslthl;
it needs to be told where its config file is, but it can only process
either http:// or absolute file:// values, not relative paths.  I'm
probably going to end up filtering that stylesheet through
maven-resources-plugin so that I can substitute an absolute path based
on Maven's ${project.basedir} property.

This commit also removes the old asciicommon.xsl import held over from
AsciiDoc.  I gathered the settings relevant for our current
DocBook->HTML output into titansingle.xsl and deleted asciicommon.xsl.

Pulled all headings up one level.  The top level is now the Part

_TODO: xref to pagename_ where the page hasn't yet been ported from
the wiki.

Made the HBase and Cassandra logos float left on the benefits-of-titan

Added [source,gremlin] annotations to Gremlin output in preparation
for creating a custom xslthl highlighter that can parse Gremlin.  Also
tried [source,bourne], but the default output for shell scripts is so
underwhelming (only ""cd"" was highlighted and everything else was in

I've completely cut out the next/prev navs at the top and bottom of
the chunked output.  Next step is probably to restore these links by
embedding them in the the static and sticky page header at the top and
just above the copyright footer at the bottom.  This will probably
involve splitting the titan.body template in titancommon.xsl into a

In this commit, `mvn -N -Psaxondoc package xml:transform` builds the
AsciiDoc source docs/index.txt into a DocBook file,
`target/generated-docs/index.xml`, which is then transformed with
Saxon using the xslthl extension for syntax highlighting to produce
the XHTML document `target/generated-resources/xml/xslt/index.xml`.

common.xsl is taken from AsciiDoc; htcust.xml is a half-page so-called
""customization layer"" stylesheet that glues together common.xsl with
xslthl highlighting.

This is the earliest proof-of-concept stage.  Much work remains in
both tweaking the XHTML style to fit with the new Titan website and in
porting the existing wikidocs to AsciiDoc before this could be
considered ready for distribution."

I'm adding this to support titan.sh in the zipfile distribution.
titan.sh ideally wants to wait until Elasticsearch is completely
started and listening on its service port before attempting to start
Rexster.  It would also be convenient to wait until Rexster is
accepting connections on the RexPro port before returning from
titan.sh; titan.sh currently just forks Rexster and returns
immediately, which leaves a window of a few seconds after titan.sh
exits but before Rexster is fully initialized in which the user can
start rexster-console.sh and get a transient connection refusal error.
The Rexster thing is not as big a deal as the ES-before-Rexster thing
though.

Anyway, this commit is inelegant: for one thing, there are existing,
widely-available programs that I would rather use than write my own
util (e.g. telnet, nc, socat, netstat, nmap... any one of them could
fill the need in this case).  However, I don't want to introduce a new
command dependency into titan.sh if I can reasonably avoid it, and I
think this qualifies as reasonable.  CheckSocket also doesn't really
belong in titan-core, but I don't have another place to put it without
restructuring the titan-dist module just for this one source file."

This prepares the zipfile to switch from embedded ES to standalone ES.
The files in this commit are based on the upstream ES 1.1.1 release,

* configured relative paths starting with ""db/"" in elasticsearch.yml

* elasticsearch.in.sh changes directory to the top-level directory of
  the expanded zipfile.  This supports the relative paths in the
  previous bullet.

* added '-Des.path.conf=...' JVM parameter in the elasticsearch shell

The titan-hadoop module won't compile in this commit.  The
faunus05/titan-hadoop source needs to be updated to match recent
refactorings in titan05 before it will compile.

However, the pom parses and the dependencies all resolve (assuming
titan-*-0.3.3-SNAPSHOT-shaded03 have been built and locally installed
or otherwise made available through a snapshot repository).

I cut aggressively in the titan-hadoop pom, removing release-related

A slightly more labor-intensive but more-reliable approach might be to
make the test block up to a much longer timeout (order of magnitude
longer than median runtime), but wakeup frequently to test whether its
expected conditions have been met and bail out early if so.

The right way to do this that's a lot more work is to mock

Fixes #591

VertexIDAssignerTest uses a MockIDAuthority that takes its partition
bounds as an integer array of length 2, then writes the ints to
StaticBuffers in its getLocalIDPartition() method.  A precondition in
this method checks that the lower buffer compares before the upper
buffer.

VertexIDAssignerTest is a JUnit parameterized test, and one parameter
set passed the int array { -10000, 10000 } to MockIDAuthority.  This
was guaranteed to fail the precondition mentioned above, since the
negative int has the MSB set and the positive int doesn't.  This
showed up as an IllegalArgumentException in
titan-test/target/test.log.

I think this bug was limited to MockIDAuthority and
VertexIDAssignerTest.  I don't see how it could affect
VertexIDAssigner or ConsistentKeyIDManager.  CKIM works in terms of
opaque bytes.  VertexIDAssigner does work with ints, but it
unsigned-shifts them down two bits before doing any comparisons,
discarding the lower order bits and guaranteeing that the resulting
int values are positive."

This commit does not preserve backwards compatibility with Cassandra
1.2.  It's a quick feasibility test for 2.0 client-side support.

* Invasive source changes are required in the embedded adapter, in
  particular with explicit timestamp handling, but the embedded tests
  pass

* Thrift adapter required only one small change: a public static
  String field storing the name of the system keyspace in a Cassandra
  internals class has moved

* Astyanax adapter is broken with no apparent upgrade path.  Astyanax
  does not yet support Cassandra 2.0 on the client side, except
  perhaps in the unreleased beta Java driver branch.  Linkage errors
  at runtime when running against 2.0

* The Guava version is delicate.  Going to 16.0 or newer breaks
  Cassandra 2.0.x, which was compiled against Guava 13.x.  16.0
  changed the return type of
  com.google.common.util.concurrent.RateLimiter.acquire(int) from void

I often want to set higher lock wait and id allocation wait times when
running tests on EC2 m1.mediums running CI, since Cassandra writes
that take 175 ms seem common (1/2 of test runs?  eyeballing a list of
recent runs, not being rigorous here), but that's an excessive wait
time on my workstation.  I'm adding an experimental test utility class
that reads a config file path (possibly relative path) from an
environment variable and reads a config from the file.  Test classes
where overridden config settings could be useful (anything that's
timeout sensitive) can pass a WriteConfiguration to the utility class
to have the overrides applied.

Initially tried to used MergedConfiguration but went insane trying to
navigate the configuration type hierarchy.  Gave up after an hour and
went with modifying a single WriteConfiguration."

Now HBase manager is 1-to-1 with HConnection.  Each manager creates
its single HConnection during construction and assigns it to a final

connection.getTable(String) and closing the returned table object in a
finally block.  These HTableInterface instances on the stack are not
thread safe.  The HConnection is only closed when the manager is
closed.

approach is faster and does not cause too many open files errors

The problem with this is twofold:

* it's very slow -- even a tiny lock write takes on average 125 ms on

  HConnection's implementation, which includes creating an executor

* my use of the HConnectionManager API may be leaking connections,

Source branch is 'master' of github.com:boorad/titan

The target branch, titan05, diverged since @boorad's work with the
introduction of separate modules for HBase 0.94 and 0.96 support and
so there were some conflicts.  I moved the mapr profile into
titan-hbase/titan-hbase-094/pom.xml and adjusted it a bit.  It's
activated by passing ""-Dhadoop.profile=mapr-1.0"" on the mvn command
line.  The profile's pom property mapr.zookeeper.version has been
renamed to zookeeper.version, and I tweaked the mvn_opts.txt file to
pass through command-line overrides to this variable so that it will
be preserved during generation of target/cached_classpath.txt.

I get a ClassNotFound with the default MapR ZK version 3.3.6.
However, with 3.4.5, the tests pass; here's the mvn command I ran from
titan-hbase/titan-hbase-094:

mvn install -Dhadoop.profile=mapr-1.0 -Dzookeeper.version=3.4.5

HBase logs these VersionInfo data:

2014-02-14 20:19:48,787 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.VersionInfo: HBase 0.94.12-mapr-1310

2014-02-14 20:19:48,787 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.VersionInfo: Compiled by root on Wed Oct 30 19:37:51 PDT 2013

This differs from the usual HBase VersionInfo and suggests that MapR
is actually running, but I'm not a MapR expert and can't vouch for the
completeness of the MapR instance inside the test harness.

VertexIDAssigner reads the first four bytes of key ranges provided by
getLocalKeyPartition as ints.  It then unsigned right shifts the ints
by two bits each to make them effectively 30 bits wide.  It does some
arithmetic on the ints to preserve inclusive-start and exclusive-end
semantics and then passes them to PartitionIDRange's constructor.

Here's the computation done on each range-end int:

  partition[1] = (partition[1] >>> 2) - 1;

If the original partition[1] value is 0, this results in
Integer.MIN_VALUE.  Because the partition width is 30 bits, this value
is invalid (too wide since the MSB is set).  This value leads to a
precondition failure shortly after in PartitionIDRange's constructor.

I think the intent is to follow the subtraction by zeroing the two
most significant bits, simulating 30-bit wide unsigned integer
arithmetic and allowing underflow.  So this commit adds a bitmask
after subtraction like so:

  partition[1] = (partition[1] >>> 2) - 1;
  partition[1] &= 0x3FFFFFFF;"

across a problem in MockIDAuthority.  Its getIDBlock method is

multiple threads.  When delayAcquisitionMS is nonzero, this can result
in unlucky threads waiting 2 or 3 times the delayAcquistionMS period

Apache Commons Config's properties file implementation seems to return
objects of type String even for small numbers that could fit in an
Integer.  In contrast, in-memory ACC configuration implementations
like those used in unit testing seem to store and return actual
numeric types (like Integer).  This commit changes
CommonsConfiguration.get(String, Class) to try to handle either case
gracefully when retrieving a value of type Number or a subtype of
Number.

The pom conflicts were mostly version disagreement.  Those were
trivial.  There were a few causes of file conflicts:

* a handful of config options added in master that had needed to be
  ported to 0.5's new ConfigOption API

* a connection timeout increase in the Cassandra test setup class
  needed to be ported to 0.5's new ConfigOption API

* the Cassandra iterator connection handling improvement made by
  Pavel, where iterators borrow a connection for the duration of each
  method call rather than the duration of their existence

Previous to this commit, GraphDatabaseConfiguration used
metrics.enable-basic-metrics while Backend used
storage.enable-basic-metrics.  There's no good reason for these
options to be separate.  It's just confusing.

The config option wording is also clumsy.  In retrospect, it should
really have been metrics.enabled.  Titan's Metrics support and
metrics.* config namespace grew out of the storage backend, but now
Metrics covers other stuff in Titan besides storage.

To support existing configs, I made GraphDatabaseConfiguration and
Backend both consider metrics globally enabled when any one (or more)
of the following config options are set to true:

* storage.enable-basic-metrics
* metrics.enable-basic-metrics
* metrics.enabled

Storage backend metrics are merged when of the following are true
(they are each true by default):

* metrics.merge-basic-metrics
* storage.merge-basic-metrics"

Changed CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_KEY from 10s to 60s for Cassandra and HBase
tests.  This was motivated by performance testing on EC2, where
truncating column families on Cassandra could take over ten seconds
after many iterations of the same test method (truncating CFs after
each run).  I'm not sure why this operation was slow, but since it's
just CF truncation in clearStorage() and so far does not appear to
affect querying, I'm just going to bump up the timeout.  The 60s value
made the timeouts disappear on an EC2 c3.xlarge."

When running memory and performance tests through Maven, I found that
HBase would die after perf tests but fail to restart for mem tests.

This turned out to be ZK failing to bind its port.  The HBase test
harness killed the HBase process with SIGTERM, which seems to prevent
ZK from cleanly closing its listen socket, which then goes into
TIME_WAIT and prevents the next ZK process from binding the port.

To fix this, I made the test harness first try to stop HBase using the
clean shutdown script provided with the HBase distro, waiting up to 20
seconds for it to finish.  If it doesn't finish, the harness resorts
to SIGKILL (not TERM).

This approach seems to resolve the issue -- now perf and mem tests
both run successfully."

ExpectedValueCheckingStore and ConsistentKeyLocker still expected
their store.mutate(...) calls to use the current timestamp.  Since the
timestamp is now controlled by StoreTxConfig, the locking code wound
up writing all its mutations within a tx with the same timestamp.
This led to thousands of warnings when testing EVCS and CKL on top of
titan-cassandra.

This commit makes each mutate call use a fresh timestamp.

titan-cassandra also recently got a new performance-regression test in
the form of TitanEventualGraphTest#testCachePerformance().  This isn't
part of @Category({ PerformanceTests.class }).  It's intended to be
run as part of the regular test suite as a ""sanity check"" on the
performance of the cache subsystem.  But titan-cassandra executes its
tests in multiple threads, so while the test passed in isolation, it
would sometimes randomly fail when other threads won the scheduler
wars.  Now this test has its own @Category({ SerialTests.class }) and
it runs in its own single-threaded surefire execution."

This introduces Infinispan transaction support backed by the JBoss
Transaction Manager, also known as Narayana and the core module of
which is known as Arjuna.  The implementation uses javax.transaction
where possible, which should theoretically ease a potential switch to
an alternative JTA/JTS transaction provider (say, Atomikos).

This commit also changes the Infinispan store configuration from
non-transactional to transactional for all tests.  I'll add the
nontransactional configuration back in as a separate test execution in
a future commit, so that each test for Infinispan is executed in both
a transactional and nontransactional configuration.

I also removed the Infinispan LockKeyColumnValueStoreTest, since its
semantics make no sense for a store that has builtin key-level locking
that doesn't implement acquireLock.  It may make sense to re-add it
with a nontransactional config.

InfinispanCacheStoreManager gains two configuration options:

* conffile (GraphDatabaseConfiguration.STORAGE_CONF_FILE_KEY)
* cacheprefix (ICSM.INFINISPAN_CACHE_NAME_PREFIX_KEY)

The former defaults to null.  When it is non-null, it is interpreted
as a path to an Infinispan XML config file and that file is used to
instantiate the EmbeddedCacheManager instance.  When it is null, the
default Infinispan global configuration takes effect.

The latter defaults to titan.  ICSM now uses cachenames in the form
<prefix>:<dbname>.  For example, under the default configuration, the
cache names are:

* titan:titan_ids
* titan:edgestore
* titan:edgestore_lock_
* titan:vertexindex
* titan:vertexindex_lock_
* titan:edgeindex

The prefix is omitted from the value returned by
InfinispanCacheStore#getName() and intended to be hidden from the
graphdb layer above it.

Why add this feature?  Potential use cases for the configurable prefix
include:

* running multiple distinct ISPN-backed databases concurrently, each
  with its own prefix

* resolving potential cache name conflicts with other ISPN clients
  (i.e. playing nice in a cotenant ISPN deployment)

* switching between different cache configs/tunings without
  necessarily rewriting infinispan.xml every time"

Now, all stores use the KeyConsistentIDAuthority which allows operating transactional stores with disabled transactions without data corruption.

Note, that this introduces an incompatibility with prior releases for the following backends:
BerkeleyDB, Persistit, and Hazelcast

* Prior to commit, the short version of lock store names were strings

  calling store.getName() on the non-lock counterpart and appending
  the lock suffix.  Now HBase remembers the store name originally used
  to open the database and returns it from getName().

* Fixed bug where HBaseStoreManager would open a new store instance

  CF name shortening was enabled.  I think this was harmless from a
  correctenss point of view, but it needlessly wasted memory."

Made Metrics configuration transaction-centric.  Each graph
transaction can be configured to disable metrics, enable metrics, or
enable metrics with a custom metric name prefix.  The last option is
intended to let users segregate Metrics measurements generated by
Titan in whatever way they like -- for instance, by setting the
metrics prefix to the name of an application or the name of an account
originating the tx.  User provided metric prefix strings override the
Titan default and will appear in whatever Metrics reporter targets the
user configures, such as Ganglia or Graphite.

This commit is a probably-buggy refactoring baseline.  It reflects the
broad strokes structural changes that I wanted to do in Metrics
configuration, but I've probably messed up the details somewhere.

The current Titan source can't build on JDK 6 (tested Oracle 6u45)
because TitanVertexQuery inherits two unrelated return types for
the method limit(int); this is supported in 7 but not 6.

Here's the exact wording of the compiler error on Oracle 6u45:

[ERROR] /home/dalaro/tinkerelius/titan/titan-core/src/main/java/com/thinkaurelius/titan/core/TitanVertexQuery.java:[16,7] types com.tinkerpop.blueprints.VertexQuery and com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.BaseVertexQuery are incompatible; both define limit(int), but with unrelated return types

Related bug: http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6908259

However, we can still compile Titan using JDK 7 with -source 1.6
-target 1.6 and -Xbootclasspath:/path/to/jdk/rt.jar.  This does not
throw the error above.

This commit records the first complete set of project poms that can
build for both jars and assemblies -target 1.6 and -target 1.7.  It's
still rough and could use some cleanup.  In particular, the ""jre6"" and
""standard"" profiles that I introduced in this commit are unnecessary
whenever the set of dependencies in each case is identical, differing
only in the dependency classifiers on titan artifacts.  I didn't
realize that at the start, so this commit includes a combination of
approaches for managing dependencies under the two compilation
targets.  Also, the names ""jre6"" and ""standard"" for compilation
targeting profiles are bad."

Why did getSlice explicitly use a signed bytes comparator when testing
columns against the lower and upper slice bounds?  It's clear that
this was deliberate, but I can't see the reasoning behind it.  It
makes a current getSlice test fail.

I changed that to unsigned and also implemented a naive column bounds
check in getKeys.  This getKeys hack could be smarter about the
caching columns it reads during slice checking for potential later
reuse by getEntries, but I'm sticking with the simple-and-dumb version
initially."

This had both conflicted diff hunks, as noted in the
automatically-generated list below, and diff hunks that applied
perfectly but caused compile errors.  Although all tests except those
in Hazelcast pass (more on that later), this was a substantial merge
and I could easily have made a mistake somewhere.

Some points of contention:

* inmemory removed the KVS getKeys(tx)

* master replaced beginTransaction(ConsistencyLevel) with
  beginTransaction(StoreTxConfig)

* inmemory modified KCVSTest to hold only one transaction open at any
  given time, whereas master did not have this refactoring but did
  have a few new test method additions; also, inmemory renamed the
  testStore public static final variable used by name in many
  subclasses

* master refactored KeyIterator to implement Iterator<StaticBuffer>,
  while inmemory rewrote several KeyIterator implementations to
  account for the first bullet in this list (I think)

* inmemory removed ensureClosed() checks inside KeyIterator hasNext()
  and next() implementations for reasons I don't understand

* minor StoreFeatures refactoring differences between master and
  inmemory, but I think those are trivial

There may be other stuff I missed.

Hazelcast is disabled because one of the new getKeys-exercising
methods in KCVSTest seemed to expose a bug in the implementation -- it
looks like it might not honor column slice values for certain
invocations of getKeys.  I'm commenting the module in the top-level
pom until I investigate the failure.

The getKeys(KeyRangeQuery keyQuery, StoreTransaction txh) method in
the Astyanax and Thrift stores seemed to be untested and broken.  This
is the getKeys method that takes both a column range and key range.
Its only supported when the backend stores keys in byte order (BOP, in
this case).

The Thrift adapter had these bugs:

* For Cassandra versions 1.2.4 and earlier,
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-5566 makes the
  client send broken slice tokens when BOP is in effect.  The server
  can't parse the tokens, logging an error and triggering an exception
  client-side.  Slicing by key is not affected -- only by tokens.
  This has a pretty simple workaround, and it goes away in 1.2.5 and
  up.  I actually already verified that it's fixed on 1.2.10, but then
  I had to revert to 1.2.2 when I discovered that Astyanax has a hard
  incompatibility (trying to call a nonexistent constructor) with
  1.2.10.

* The ordered getKeys checked for `partitioner instanceof
  OrderPreservingPartitioner` and threw an exception if false.  But
  this is always false with BOP.  BOP doesn't inherit from OPP and
  never has AFAIK (= moderate certainty back to about 0.7).  Changed
  OPP in the instanceof check to AbstractByteOrderedPartitioner.  I
  have an extremely strong sense of déjà vu about this bug, but I
  don't know where in the revision history I might have previously
  fixed it, if at all.

* The last key was returned by the ordered getKeys method.  Judging
  from KeyRangeQuery and the tests for this method, I think the last
  key is supposed to be considered exclusive.

The Astyanax adapter just had the last bug in the list above.  I fixed
all of the above (I think).

I fixed the first bullet point about junk BOP tokens in a
forward-compatible way.  When we go to 1.2.5 and beyond, the
workaround should quietly turn itself off at runtime.  Then we can
remove it as soon as we're ready to drop compatibility with prior
versions.  I also added forward-compatibility to
CassandraThriftStorageManager's token handling; it wasn't buggy on our
current Cassandra version, but it would have failed when we eventually
upgrade to 1.2.5 and beyond.

I refactored Cassandra tests and the way Maven runs them.  By default,
all Cassandra tests now run twice with Maven: once under BOP and once
under RP.

Test classes or methods can be marked as eligible for only BOP or RP
by annotating them with

 @Category({ UnorderedKeyStoreTests.class })

or

 @Category({ OrderedKeyStoreTests.class })

There is also an annotation which explicitly declares the subject
compatible with either type of store, but it is redundant, because
that is the default behavior under the current Maven config:

 @Category({ KeyOrderAgnosticTests.class })

All of the annotation argument classes are in the package
com.thinkaurelius.titan.testcategory in titan-test.

Eclipse's native JUnit runner appears to have no way to honor the new
JUnit @Category annotation, so it will blithely try to run all tests
regardless of their categories using the default config, which I've
set to BOP.  When Eclipse runs an BOP-only test with a RP config, it
fails.  I haven't found a clean way to workaround that yet.  We could
make all the tests interrogate StoreFeatures to see what's possible,
but that will add some boilerplate.  It would be worth the boilerplate
to get the tests to ""just work"" in Eclipse though.

Finally, both ExpectedValueCheckingStore and
BufferedKeyColumnValueStore had bugs in both of their getKeys methods:
the one that takes a SliceQuery and the other that takes a
KeyRangeQuery.  They weren't unwrapping their transactions when
interacting with the wrapped store.

I also finished removing Rexster classes, test classes, and Maven
dependencies."

Removed the ""cassandra.db."" prefix from these Cassandra configuration
keys:

* compression.enabled
* compression.chunk_length_kb
* compression.sstable_compression

Also: the middle option in the list was formerly chunk_size_kb.  I
changed it to chunk_length_kb because that's the string Cassandra uses
and I don't see a reason why the need to be subtly different.

I think the ""cassandra"" prefix is redundant because graph configs have
""storage.backend"", which must be set to a one of the strings
identifying a Cassandra backend for any of these keys to be read by
Titan in the first place.  ""db"" is debatable."

  because CompressionParameters contains logic to prepend

The test testStandardIndexVertexPropertyReads left open transactions

transactions in the first place, instead sharing the class member tx
across several concurrent methods.

This commit also makes the test method wait for the runnables it
submits to an executorservice to complete by get()'ing their futures.
This was previously racy: tearDown() would wait five seconds for the
executor's tasks to complete and then it would throw an exception.
Now the method waits until all the tasks it started are complete
before returning and allowing control transfer to tearDown()."

At compile-time, Titan's ES version is written to titan-es.properties.
The properties file gets included in the titan-es jar.
ElasticSearchConstants loads the properties file at runtime using
getResourceAsStream(...), just like TitanConstants.
ElasticSearchConstants then converts the version into a public static
final field on ES's Version class and loads that reflectively.
Finally, ElasticSearchIndex compares this expected version against
Version.CURRENT at runtime and logs a warning if they don't match.

Note that a version mismatch does *not* throw an exception.  It just
logs a warning.

This is all hideous and byantine and awful.  I wish there was an
easier way to check the ES version using only strings.  It's so easy
to get the cluster's version using the REST HTTP API, but I don't see
an equivalent way to do it with only the Java API, and I don't want to
add a whole second client to the ES index implementation just to read
a 6-byte version string."

This shows that we can mirror the customized imports in Titan's
Console.java file in Rexster without modifying Rexster's source or
resorting to an extension.  However, this commit introduces
copy-pasted duplication between Console.java and rexster.xml.  I think
I see a better way to do this now.  The logic in Console.java that
executes groovy import statements should be extracted into a static
method or a method on some new throwaway object.  It will return
groovy code.  A new main method should be introduced to call this
helper method and write the code to a file.  Rexster can then be
configured to execute it via the <init-scripts> configuration option
in the <script-engine> stanza for Gremlin.  It might even be possible
to build this into the titan-dist maven lifecycle, so that it's fully
automated."

In the consistentkey backend, this peek method could skip valid
blocks, limiting its usefulness.  It deosn't appear to be used
anywhere outside a single test method, so I deleted the method from
both its interface and implementations.

In the consistentkey implementation of IDAuthority, the process of
allocating a block happens in approximately two steps.  1. Write the
backend to claim an ID block.  2. If the write took longer than a
certain configurable time limit, try to delete it, otherwise return
the block as successfully allocated.

The problem: ""peek"" just looks at written claims.  If peek happens
after a write completed but before the responsible machine deletes it,
then peek will consider it allocated and skip it.  A subsequent call
for the next block may then return a start less than what peek
reported.

If we come up with a genuine need to peek at ID blocks, then we'll
need to modify the consistentkey implementation to avoid this behavior

This changeset generates a single JaCoCo coverage file containing the
aggregated coverage data for all Maven modules containing tests.  It
also adds a Sonar plugin configuration that uploads the coverage data
to a Sonar server.  The approach is inelegant, but it seemed to be the
least worst compromise between various tooling limitations.  In
particular, Sonar operates on a per-module basis, and it appears to
discard coverage data for source files outside the module it's
currently considering.  This is a problem for our project, since most
of our tests exercise code across Maven module boundaries."

The files in this commit can build a single debian/ubuntu package
called titan that contains all Titan jars and dependent jars, an
init.d script that controls RexsterTitanServer, a copy of
rexster-console.sh, and an embeddedcassandra config to get started.  I
tested it Ubuntu 12.04 VMs using Vagrant.

Potential areas for future improvement:

* run as an ordinary user instead of root

* depend on the datastax .deb packages and use the jars it provides
  for cassandra instead of duplicating them in our own package

* split the monolithic titan package a set of feature-specific
  subpackages similar to how the maven modules are split --
  titan-cassandra, titan-hbase, titan-es

* use some combination of maven resource filtering and debian
  substvars to eliminate version number repetition; versions numbers
  should only live in pom.xml files

* (maybe) generate debian-formatted changelog from our own changelog

* add titan's wiki documentation to the package under /usr/share/doc

* run lintian and piuparts

* add stub manpages with invocation synopses and referrals to the main
  wiki-generated documentation"

This enforcer rule walks the dependency tree throws an error if it
finds multiple versions of any one dependency.  It prints the paths it
walked from the project root to each of the dependency declarations.

This suspends maven's automatic version conflict resolution.  The user
has to resolve all conflicts by explicitly excluding unwanted versions
(including those pulled in transitively --
dependencies-of-dependencies).

Allowing maven to automatically resolve dependency versions resulted
in more than one version within each of the lucene-*, asm-*, and
jersey-* sets of jars, and that has caused problems with two of those
sets so far.

I attempted to resolve the backlog of conflicts somewhat sensibly,
though these initial version selections will likely need fine tuning.
The project builds and the tests pass, but this is still sort of an
experiment."

Travis builds 227.1 and .3 failed due to the same exception in the
same test method, parallelNoncontendedLockStressTest.  The log
suggests that locks are expiring before the LockStressor threads in
this test can check their locks, resulting in an underrun on a success
counter and the assertion shown in the logs.

I made two changes:

* Changed expire exception type from PermanentLockingException to
  TemporaryLockingException and made the test count the sum of
  successful locked operations and operations that failed due to
  TemporaryLockingExceptions (but not Permanent or any other type)

* Increased the test's lock expire time from 1s to 5s

I also added a log statement that might help check my analysis if the
build fails again on Travis.  This commit passed the test suite
locally, but so did the commit that just failed on Travis."

The conflicts were mainly at the intersection of the refactored
consistentkey locking code and parallel testing in Cassandra.
LocalLockMediators were not in keyspace-specific namespaces to keep
parallel Cassandra tests from interfering and causing false local lock
contention.  I think I resolved it in this commit, but if I did make
an error merging, it's probably got something to do with
LocalLockMediator configuration in the new ConsistentKey- and/or
AstyanaxRecipeLocker.

The complete Titan test suite did pass on my box the three consecutive
times that I ran it before committing.

The only substantial conflicts were in LockKeyColumnValueStoreTest.
Commit 6c0c5d8489dc422707a66264560ac0236fc31bd9 on master made some
nonstatic variables into static ones.  I changed them back to
nonstatic to make them compatible with parallel test class execution
for cassandra.  But there were also some refactorings in that commit
that might have been worth keeping -- I had trouble teasing the
harmless refactorings apart from the threadsafety problem and I
probably cut too much of that commit out when trying to fix things.

This commit collects experimental release-engineering commits from the
fork github.com/dalaro2/titan, plus some additional commits from my
local repo.  I used a fork under the bogouser dalaro2 while
experimenting with release automation to keep my credentials separate
and reduce the likelihood of unintentionally pushing a ""release"" of
titan.  However, the dalaro2/titan commit history is noisy and
confusing because of all the fake releases and revert commits that I
made while testing.  The net changes are fairly small when expressed
as a patch between the common ancestor commit in titan03
(771fb4e10a2494c6569a210a16f8d3187aa4ae87) and the fork head, so I'm
collecting them into this new commit rather than pulling history from
the experimental fork.

The most important operational note about this commit relates to the
doc directory.  doc is no longer contained inside the titan repo.  doc
now points to the titan wiki repo using git submodules.  Furthermore,
all images used in the wiki that used to live in gh-pages now live in
the images folder inside the wiki repo.

There's a lot of documentation for git-submodules, but the cliffs
notes are something like:

* after cloning titan, do ""git submodule update --init"" to get doc
* when switching from a branch with submodule doc to a branch with
  the old doc directory, you may have to first ""rm -rf doc"""

The method testMultiIDAcquisition in LockKeyColumnValueStoreTest
manually instantiated and started threads.  Assertion failures inside
those threads would appear on stderr, but they wouldn't be visible to
the JUnit runner and hence wouldn't directly fail the enclosing test.
Failures were detected indirectly by scrutinizing some state variables
after all the threads finished running.

This commit replaces manual thread instantiation with a standard
library ExecutorService.  The ES returns a Future for every Runnable
given to it.  The Future's get() method in turn throws an
ExecutionException containing any exception (such as an assertion
failure) generated by the runnable.  The test method rethrows these
exceptions when they occur, effectively making them visible to JUnit."

Writing a lock claim to storage may appear to fail on the client,

example, a Cassandra cluster could complete a write but fail to
acknowledge it before triggering a TimeoutException.  These claims
linger in storage and pointlessly block lock aquisition by other
processes until aging past the lock expiration time.

This commit changes the lock verification step to accept a sequence of
claims sharing the same rid and differing only in their timestamps, so
long as the final timestamp matches that expected by the verifier.

Issue #291 shows Astyanax's connection timeout logic generating a
negative sleep time.  The log timestamps in the issue suggest that the
Astyanax timeout configuration is the default.

By default, Titan uses Astyanax's BoundedExponentialBackoff to
generate timeouts.  Though Thread.sleep() eventually gets a long
value, BoundedExponentialBackoff and parent class ExponentialBackoff
use int arithmetic internally.  This leads to integer overflow and
wraparound to negative values when baseWaitTimeMS * (1 <<
(attemptcount + 1)) crosses Integer.MAX_VALUE.  Our default
configuration ran afoul of this on its final timeout attempt before
exhausting its 30 retries.

This commit changes the defaults to:
* base wait time: 100 ms
* maximum attempts/retries/exponent: 8
* maximum allowed wait time: 25000 ms

The maximum integer calculated in ExponentialBackoff will be 100 * (1
<< (7+1)) = 25600, well below overflow (and that will in turn be
capped at 25000)."

for example, in a Cassandra cluster with hinted handoff enabled where

During the migration from ByteBuffer to StaticBuffer and friends, I
missed a Map in CassandraThriftStoreManager#mutateMany() that for
which get() calls used StaticBuffer keys but put() calls used
ByteBuffer keys.  These two types never equals() one another, so get()
always returned null.  The resulting bug made mutateMany() write each
key provided in its argument in at most one column family.  If a key
appeared under multiple column families in mutateMany()'s argument,
then only one CF actually received writes on the key, and all
additions/deteletions under the key in question were ignored for the
remaining CFs.

This bug caused a failure in a tangentially related test that touched
the buggy code plus a lot of other code.  This test just exercises the
buggy code.

A fix for the mutateMany() bug comes in the next commit."

The Astyanax class RowQuery<K, C> has two colliding/ambiguous method
signatures for withColumnRange() when K=C=ByteBuffer.  I'm using the
raw type to avoid this problem, but it's an unclean solution and
prevents the compiler from typechecking the first two arguments to
withColumnRange.  These used to be ByteBuffers but were changed to
StaticBuffer in a recent commit, causing Astyanax to die.  This patch
converts the StaticBuffers back to ByteBuffers.  I'd still rather find
a way to let the compiler typecheck the method call in question

erroneously depends on 12.0:

Added jsr305 as a dependency.  A few classes in titan-cassandra import
javax.annotation.Nullable and use the @Nullable annotation.  Guava
12.0 provided jsr305 to make this work, but 13.0.1 no longer provides

One of these timing bugs was brain damage left over from my last
commit: there were attempted conversions in LockingTransactionHandle
from milli- to nanoseconds using a factor of 1000 instead of 100000.

The other timing bug was older than my last commit.
LockingTransactionHandle read nanosecond timestamps from the storage
backend, but then proceeded to try to figure out whether those
timestamps had expired by comparing them to milliseconds without
conversion.

I've added test cases in LockKeyColumnValueStoreTest that should look
for these cases.

LockingTransactionHandle is pretty fragile at this point.  It could
probably benefit from some refactoring to reduce method size and
per-method control structure nesting depth.  It might be wise to make
it uniformly handle only nanosecond timestamps, too."

This commit is a bundle of changes copied over in patch form from
another workstation.  I should probably be using git-bundle.

LocalLockManager is in an intermediate state in this commit: it now
polices zombie locks, but it also permits attempts to lock with
expiration times in the past.  The unit test is also anemic.

I'm planning to add a unit test at the KeyColumnValueStore level which
explicitly configures lock timeout calls acquireLock() on a
transaction and sleeps to test it."

The loop to release all locks held by a transaction could be
prematurely exited by an exception, such as TimedOutException, thrown
during the backend interaction for any one of the locks.

The current behavior encloses every unlock attempt in its own
try-catch block.  This means that individual unlocks could still
timeout, but unlockAll() will not give up on the rest of its
outstanding locks after the first exception it encounters.

This commit also adds some assertions and logging statements to
unlockAll()."

The CassandraEmbedded StorageManager and OKCVS implementations talk to
Cassandra using ordinary method calls instead of Thrift.  Cassandra
must already be running in the JVM for this to work.  The four unit
tests added by this commit exercise the embedded backend.  The only
testing I've done on this code is the unit tests in this commit.

This backend is essentially a stripped-down adaptation of the code
sitting between Thrift and StorageProxy in Cassandra mainline.
Permission checks and keyspace/column family validation checks present
in mainline have been removed in this implementation."

Formerly, the ID allocator would write a column to its backing store,
wait a little while, and then read the entire row containing the
column it just wrote.  The ID allocator then decided whether it
succeeded by checking whether the lexicographically last column on the
row was the one it just wrote.

This created a potential to enter the the following (racy) livelock:

A starts loop, reads partition row, gets latest counter C
A writes column claiming C+1
B reads partition row, gets latest counter C+1
B writes column claiming C+2
A starts verification, reads partition row, gets latest counter C+2 from B
A determines that it failed, since B's C+2 comes after its C+1
A starts loop, reads partition row, gets latest counter C+2 again
A writes column claiming C+3
B starts verification, reads partition row, gets latest counter C+3 from A
B determines that it failed, since A's C+3 comes after its C+2
B starts loop, reads partition row, gets latest counter C+3 again
B writes column claiming C+4
... and so on to failure by exceeding maximum retries

The ID allocator now avoids this by reading just a slice of the
partition row, instead of the whole partition row, during
verification; the slice contains only those columns that start with
the targeted counter value.  This prevents an ID allocator from seeing
claims for counter values higher than the one it is currently
attemting to grab.

Like the rest of the current ID allocation implementation, this is OK
for fixed-size and fixed-offset blocks (I think) but would be
incorrect for variable block sizes.  We don't implement variable block
sizes yet in the ID allocator, so this is not a material concern right
now.

This change is just a few lines, but the code is delicate.  All the
InternalCassandra* and InternalAstyanax* tests pass on my machine with
this change, but it is otherwise untested."

When Titan's Cassandra keyspace was removed by external (non-Titan)
means, stale pooled Thrift connections and OKVCS objects would linger.
The Cassandra-Thrift backend subsequently failed to detect the absent
keyspace and recreate it.

On Titan systems with multiple local-lock-mediator-prefix settings,
this patch could potentially cause rendundant but harmless recreation
of CassandraThriftOKCVS objects.  This configuration only appears in
testing.  It still wouldn't hurt to refine this behavior out."

On an unrelated note, I added an exclusion for the sonatype gossip
artifact.  This is an slf4j binding which is a dependency of gremlin
(possibly with some degree of transitivity between gremlin and
gossip).  It conflicted with the existing log4j binding for slf4j.
I'm not sure that log4j is really better for Titan than gossip; I just
kept log4j because it's been in the Titan codebase for so long."

This commit removes the last of CassandraTransaction's dependencies on
the CassandraThriftStorageManager type.  CassandraTransaction now has
a reference of type StorageManager where it formerly needed a
CassandraThriftStorageManager.  Locking column families are now lazily
created in the backing Cassandra cluster (whereas they were formerly
created eagerly during openDatabase()).

This commit also fixes a bug in the ID allocation code for Cassandra.
Formerly, this code wasn't waiting after writing an ID block claim for
the time period mandated by the protocol draft.  This could have
caused contending claimants on an ID block to fail to detect their
contention.  Now the code waits after writing an ID block when
necessary.  This bug wasn't exposed under our current test cases and
is fundamentally tricky to test because it's racy and distributed.

This commit also adds commented logic for a close() implementation on
KCVStores that actually does something.  Cassandra doesn't use or
really need a functioning close() method right now, so its commented,
but I'm putting it in this commit for potential future reference."

may be refactored out of existence later, but it gets the test case back to
succeeding for now.  The only subclass of LockKCVStoreTest that actually
works right now is for Cassandra, but this fix should also apply to HBase

- Configuration is read from properties files using comons Configuration
- Storage backend specific configuration is removed. StorageManager constructor is assumed to take Configuration as argument and loaded dynamically using reflection
- getSlice method makes the assumption that startColumn is inclusive and endColumn is exclusive thereby simplifying the interface
- openDatabase returns ordered database, openOrderedDatabase removed (in StorageManager)
- added getIDBlock method to StorageManager (through interface IDAuthority). This is used to manage the id pool inside Titan

The last change required a re-engineering of the internal id pool managed. The old LocalID was deprecated and a new IDPool interface as well as a StandardIDPool implementation added. Also, a dummy LocalIDManager was added to implement getIDBlock for Cassandra and Hbase - this needs to be replaced because it only works locally.

the number of nanoseconds since the UNIX Epoch.  I estimate the

slowness wrt true time.  The error bound can be tuned downward with
increasingly fancy static initializer code.

The final bit in any timestamp is 0 for delete mutations and 1 for
insert mutations.  This limits effective time precision in timestamps
to 2 ns increments.

The mutate and mutateMany methods in the Cassandra-Thrift KCV store
have been reimplemented to make just one batch_mutate call to the

deleteMany methods are gone.  The only public methods besides the ctor

The Cassandra backend prior to this commit used
System.currentTimeMillis() as the timestamp for mutations.  When Titan
issued multiple writes to a certain key and column within a single
millisecond, the tie would be broken by lexical comparison on value.
This is unacceptable for Titan.

As a temporary solution, mutations issued to any given Cassandra
Thrift backend are now effectively limited to a rate of one per
millisecond.  The mutation stream issued by Titan is also guaranteed a
strictly increasing series of timestamps via an AtomicLong stored
inside the CassandraThriftOKCVS.

The current 1 mutation/ms limitation could be made granular by (a)
tracking timestamp series on a per-key, per-column, or per-key-column
basis or (b) using a smaller time unit than milliseconds in the
Cassandra timestamp field; 2^64 ms is about 584 million years; we
could steal some of those bits to provide micro or nanosecond
precision, but then we would need to either abandon wall-clock
accuracy beyond millisecond precision or use something like JNA to
call native timekeeping functions that offer such precision; even
then, NTPv4 is only so accurate."

I deleted pom.xml deps leftover from when Cassandra wasn't distributed
to Maven Central.  I also increased the cassandra-all dep version from
1.0.7 to 1.1.0 (the current release).

The Cassandra test config also seemed to be allowing Cassandra too
small a heap to survive through the full series of test methods in
CassandraThriftKeyColumnValueTest.  The daemon would sometimes die
partway through this test class, at which point the Thrift client
binding would typically emit a timeout or premature socket EOF error.
I changed the test to stop and start Cassandra between each test
method, as opposed to using one daemon for the entire class.  I expect
to take another look at this when checking our Cassandra testing
configs for 1.1.x compatibility."

running the HBase tests -- they just assume there's a server up that
they can talk to.  Interestingly, while the Cassandra and HBase
backends fail several methods in GraphDBTest, InMemory also fails one
(for what are likely reasons unique to it).

I added HBase and hadoop-core dependencies to pom.xml.
