The Verdi project used the proof assistant Coq to verify Raft's core algorithm. Diego wrote a TLA+ spec for Raft (https://github.com/ongardie/raft.tla), but didn't manage to prove it correct. (He describes in his thesis that he verified a part of the protocol with the TLA proof system, but it grew too tedious.)

Of course, Verdi's proof didn't cover cluster membership changes, which is where the paper actually had a bug...."
