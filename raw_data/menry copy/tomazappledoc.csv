Appledoc gives warnings when it encounters parsing issues inside
source code blocks.  In particular, it looks for style markup and
reference links.  These are especially bad within ObjectiveC
source code example blocks because of the ObjectiveC bracket
syntax and the obligatory underscores for category methods on
Cocoa classes.

This is similar to bug #72, but not exactly.  I noticed that in
another similar report, these issues are gone in version 3, so I
didn't bother trying to fix this completely.

Basically, the code intercepts the markdown processing, and looks
for any sections within documentation blocks that are marked with
either @code/@endcode of the ~~~/~~~ and ```/``` markdown syntax.

If it finds those blocks, it will output them as markup (making
sure to use the backtick format), and skip any further processing
for that block of text."

The cast to `__va_list_tag *` fails with an error on my system (OS X 10.8.4, Xcode 4.6.3). I've tried several other possibilities and was unable to find a way to make the cast in a way that does build. So, I removed it, and suppressed the warning.

Faking out a va_list is kind of dirty to begin with, so I think suppressing this warning is okay.

If there's a better fix I'd be happy to use that instead!

When a link falls within another link, such as a URL string within a method call, processing both would result in the processed URL being appended to the processed method call, duplicating the text from the URL. Instead, keep track of the links processed, and ignore a link if it's inside of a previously processed link.

Here's a test case which illustrates the problem:

```objc
/**
`NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@""http://example.com/v1/""]`
*/
@interface Fooclass : NSObject
@end
```

Result:

```html
<p><code>NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@""http://example.com/v1/""]</code>http://example.com/v1/<code>""]</code></p>
```

With patch:
```html
<p><code>NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@""http://example.com/v1/""]</code></p>
```

The test case does indeed cover this problem but certainly could be improved."

1. Xcode will crash on ALT-DoubleClick every time when trying to look up selected text in Xcode Organiser
2. ALT-Click shows QuickHelp bubble OK, but if the method is not from one of the standard framework classes, the 'Reference' link at the bottom of the pop-up is not shown.
   Thus you can't jump to Organiser help on  your own classes and methods from the Quick Help bubble.
3. Added sample Xcode integration script to generate dockets automatically as target

Fix Notes:
    1. modify template file ""tokens-template.xml"" to add node reference for methods
    2. modify ""GBDocSetOutputGenerator.m"" to add this node reference to the generated xml file"

a path which this binary will look for as a last resort.

That makes the default case of, ""please give me the latest version

Dash can take advantage of appledoc generated documentation sets by displaying TOC and click to copy. To be able to do so, it requires `--docset--platform-family` value to be `appledoc`. Current documentation set reference doesn't mention this key anymore, so it seems safe to hijack it. If this isn't desired, you can still revert to empty string or whichever value you want by explicitly using the cmd line switch (of course, you can also do it inside project or global settings plist files)."

The problem was in appledoc expecting to have either both or neither of variable name and type keywords for a method argument. So this would pass `-(void)method:`, but this not `-(void)method:var`. The fix is simple: just assume the argument is `id`. So later example would transform internally to `-(void)method:(id)var`. Which is probably what Objective C compiler does too.

Have no idea why I didn't think of this before, it's much less restricting (although probably not the recommended way of doing things in ObjC, but that's whole other topic I guess :)"

Today got a feedback from Apple on my bug report:

> When constructing the Tokens.xml file, you have to remember that the file needs to be valid XML first and foremost.  You cannot have a standalone & or an unrecognized XML &entity; in an XML file.  They have to be encoded for the XML first.  For example, if you have the abstract string ""This & that"", you need to store it in the XML file like this:
>
>     <Abstract>This &amp; that</Abstract>
>
> When docsetutil (or any XML parser) reads the abstract string, the &amp; will get converted into a plain & character.  If you are trying to display a literal entity string, such as ""This &asterisk; that"", you need to still escape the ampersand character:
>
>     <Abstract>This &amp;asterisk; that</Abstract>
>
> However, if you want your entity to render as a particular character when displayed in QuickHelp, you need to mark the string as HTML:
>
>     <Abstract type=""html"">This &amp;asterisk; that</Abstract>
>
> The XML parser will see the abstract string as ""This &asterisk; that"" and will pass it on to the HTML parser, which will then render the string like ""This * that"".
>
> Please let us know if that information helps you resolve the issue.

Turns out the fix is to change abstract type to html and replace all occurrences of `&` with `&amp;` in token xml files, so for example `&ndash;` should become `&amp;dash;`. Tried few tests on it and works for me. The literals (i.e. `&ndash;`) are properly rendered in Xcode quick help and html. Took a while, but this solution didn't occur to me... Have a go and report back if you have any issue with this."

The problem was in appledoc interpreting `-` after `#pragma mark` as start of instance method definiton/declaration and as it failed to match open parenthesis after, it skipped the rest of unmatched symbols until next match was found. This effectively resulted in first method or property after the pragma being skipped. The fix herein should handle these situations...

**Implementation note:** Note that the code first goes on and tries to match a method (due to minus sign). Method matching code was updated so that it skips repeating minus and plus until followed by an open parenthesis. This covered methods after pragma, but property definition still remained problematic. Although method matching properly exits once it finds `@property` token, the token is consumed before giving a chance of matching a property. Hence the code had to be updated to prevent consuming. This successfully parsed the property, however property matching code reset comments. So a class level flag was introduced that is set inside method matching code and is checked before resetting comment when parsing property; if flag is set, comments are not reset, otherwise they are. Not the prettiest solution, but (seems) to work..."

The problem with star delimited unordered lists was in appledoc comment preprocessor which consumed single star and replaced them with double star markers so that text would be emitted in bold. That's actually a feature of appledoc which allows single stars be used for bold markers, but may break compatibility with Markdown as the result. As there's no reliable way of determining whether the user wants to have star delimited, I decided to go the route I had in my mind for some time now: introduce another command line switch that would prevent handling single stars. It's on/off solution, so not the best one, but everyone can choose at least... Also updated [online documentation](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc-docs-examples-basic/index.html#compatibility) with example of using the new switch.

**Important:** As of this version on, single star handling is **off** by default! This may break backwards compatibility with some folks, but I feel it's better to keep as Markdown compatible for new people as possible..."

But the code that was creating token only handled classes, categories, protocols and their members; when other type of object was encountered (i.e. static document/companion guide), the method token generation was assumed which failed due to missing data.

Anyway, the fix introduced here first checks all (currently) supported object types and returns `nil` for unsupported types, then the code that prepares data for template renderer checks for `nil` and only adds related object if there is some."

Added support for excluding paths from the output. Use `--exclude-output` option for entering all paths that should be parsed, but excluded from generated output.

Although this is similar to `--ignore`, there's one important difference: Ignore option will simply prevent any parsing happening over specified files or folders, hence it will result in warnings in case symbols from these paths are referenced in documentation that gets parsed. Exclude parses specified files or folders, but it simply doesn't output them, therefore you get no warnings. It's somewhat slower on the other hand due to having to parse extra files."

By using special log format `--logformat xcode`, appledoc formats warnings and errors related to source files in a way that Xcode is able to catch them and display them in build results. Currently only warnings are using that format (there is no error log message related to source files).

*Implementation details:* Note that implementation required tweaking Cocoa Lumberjack source. Specifically, it required passing in original source code filename and line number to log message. Although logging macros pick up source file and line automatically through `__FILE__` and `__LINE__`, these belong to appledoc sources. But for Xcode warnings making sense, we need to write the file name and line of the context being parsed. To reuse existing macros, I added both values to DDMessage and additional class method to DDLog which needs to be called prior to logging. The method will simply store info to static vars. Then logging method will pick up stored values, write them to message and reset static vars. When emitting log messages, Xcode formatter will check if these values are set and emit specially formatted logs, otherwise it will revert to message only.

*Additional note:* Although I searched for all occurrences of `GBLogWarn` and `GBLogError` in the project and updated those that seemed relevant, some may have been left out - let me know about exact messages and I will check it. Also note that parsing code currently doesn't emit warnings, if something goes wrong, exceptions are raised, which doesn't log the file and line. Didn't take much time to go into this as these usually indicate parsing code needs to be refined."

Explanation: these placeholders are used to properly handle inline code or example blocks code which Markdown doesn't process. This is a remnant of converting to Discount as Markdown processor. Markdown treats single star as italics (double stars as bold), but appledoc treats it as bold, so we need to do some preprocessing and converting all single stars to double ones. However as appledoc doesn't control comment text processing anymore and Markdown doesn't process inline code or comment block text, there are two options: either detect comment blocks and inline code formatting and prevent handling text in there, or always convert to double stars and later on convert back to single ones leftovers. Although the first choice would lead to more consistent results, it would complicate code, especially for handling example blocks and duplicate substantial parts of Markdown functionality. So I decided to go with second choice, but needed some way of reliably converting double stars back to single ones (i.e. don't want to just convert any occurrence as users may actually have used double stars in some cases). To circumvent this, appledoc uses placeholders whenever it converts single stars. Later on it removes these placeholders to get clean HTML. But obviously cleanup code got confused and didn't convert all occurrences, especially when found in separate comment blocks. New code should handle these better."

The problem was in the processing code which didn't use search range but instead searched till the end of the string.

Also added additional unit test to guard against this for the future changes. Briefly checked other methods dealing with partial strings and they look valid, but it would be nice to keep this in mind in case something similar happens in the future.

Note: This was one of those small issues code-wise that resulted in totally messed up output, giving impression some fundamental flaw was present.

The problem was with appledoc treating single star as bold and single underscore as italics while Markdown treats single star or underscore as italics and double star or underscore as bold. This requires appledoc preprocessing comment text and converting any single star marker to double star. However as Markdown processor doesn't convert markers inside code blocks, this effectively changed the layout in there. To further complicate the issue, appledoc preprocessor doesn't know in advance whether certain part of text will be converted to code block or not. To compensate, appledoc now leaves original markers untouched and uses placeholder strings when converting single stars to double ones. These placeholders are caught and properly handled later on, in generated HTML where detecting code block or span is simple."

The difference is it's not possible to link to it from other objects or documents (each generated object html already contains the link to main index and hierarchy).

The problem was in the way comments were being processed. If any comment contained @name, it was always used for creating a new task section, even if followed by uncommented method. However delimited comments:

	///--------------------
	/// @name Something
	///--------------------

Were not correctly detected as @name comments. The reason was in the regex being used for matching @name: it expected the @name at the start of the comment string. By changing the regex to match in any line, this works correctly. The downside is that section names spanning multiple lines are now ignored (you can delimit @name and first word by new line though). On the other hand, I don't think anybody uses section names in such a way, so it'll probably work just fine.

Proper solution would require using two regexes: one for matching @name before stripping delimiters and one for matching afterwards. Or alternatively strip delimiters immediately after recognizing a comment (at present this is all delayed until needed to make the tool as efficient as possible)."

This is properly handled now: first you must explicitly enable output cleaning with `--clean-output`. But even so, there is additional guard: if `--output` option is omitted, output is not cleaned even if explicitly required. Seems safer this way...

As to main creation flags: these are now properly handled regarding user's input. If she requires creation of higher level output, all lower level outputs are automatically enabled.

I chose an user's suggestion to create a text file in output path in such case. To make it even more useful, the file contains the path the documentation set was installed to and installation time.

To make it even less confusing, contents of output path are deleted before running appledoc.

There are several ways of adding project settings:

- Add AppledocSettings.plist file to one of the paths given to appledoc on command line. If the file is found in a path, it's settings are automatically injected. The same path is also used for source parsing. This allows command line like `appledoc .`.
- Add specific path to a file with arbitrary name and .plist extension. The settings from the file are injected, but the file is not used for parsing.

In both cases, the .plist file has the same syntax as global settings file, except that project settings allow additional option `--input`, which should be an array of strings, each pointing to a source file or directory. These paths can be relative to the .plist file or absolute (will update online documentation soon with examples).

This took quite a bit longer than estimated, but was worth it as now full Markdown syntax is supported (with extensions). Instead of doing internal parsing of source code, I embedded [Discount](http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/) for this. Check the documentation to see all options it supports!

Documentation is now 100% Markdown compatible, although several appledoc features are preserved and change default Markdown syntax:

- Single star is converted to strong tag instead of em as in Markdown. You can also use Markdown default double star or double underscore for the same effect!
- Single star and underscore markers are still converted to strong/em combination. Markdown would otherwise convert these to strong only.
- Cross references are handled the same way as before.
- You can now use cross references to documented objects with arbitrary descriptions (#41) using Markdown inline links like this: `[description](Class)` or `[description]([Class method:] ""title""). If the address is recognized as documented object, this will be converted to proper link using description as the text! This works for classes, categories, protocols, methods and static documents!
- You can also use the same for Markdown ref links, so this: `[description][1]` followed by: `[1]: Class` or `[1]: [Class method:] ""title""` is properly converted to link to object, method or static document.

Generally the documentation should be backwards compatible, so most users won't notice a difference, but there are a couple of points that are handled differently now with Discount, so some may experience different layout in the generated HTML files. You should now follow [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Perhaps most noticeable: example blocks following list item are now treated as continuation of list item, whereas before they were converted to example blocks. Hopefully these changes are for the best and definitely more in-spec with Markdown... If you experience some strange behavior, open a new issue or comment on this one...

If appledoc creates a cross reference link in a text that's later on converted to code block by Markdown processor, all such links are cleaned up when creating HTML value. This is required as Markdown processor doesn't process links inside these blocks.

Note that this is not the most elegant solution: first we process the text and convert to links, then we process generated HTML again and remove inserted links. Ideally, this situation should be detected while processing string and prevent creating links there in the first place. However we would require reimplementing detection of code blocks there, so at least for now, this should be good enough - as code blocks are not that common this should not affect performance too much..."

Using back tick Markdown syntax for code span, prevents Markdown from processing embedded text.

This was one of much requested features. It allows adding arbitrary files to generated documentation. It's enabled with one or more `--include` switches. All files and directories specified are simply copied to `docs` subfolder within generated HTML files. So basically, you're free to write any HTML or whatever you want included with the generated documentation.

But the power lies in special ""template"" files. These are just normal text files which names end with `-template` (for example `document1-template.html). Extension of these files is not important - they will always be converted to .html! The files can reside on any subpath - the path will be preserved. All such files are processed using the same logic as any other comment, so you can use appledoc comment syntax, including cross referencing any object or member. You can also cross reference these files from ""normal"" comments (or other documents) by simply writing the filename without `-template` and extension. You don't have to deal with subpaths either, these will be automatically picked up for you! [Online documentation](http://tomaz.github.com/appledoc) is not yet updated, will do it shortly.

At this point, it's basic stuff only. As such it has much potential for future (like adding markdown syntax for headings, images and similar - for now just use HTML tags). But at least it's a start and get's work done for the moment.

Enjoy and let me know if you find something not working as expected :)"

The issue was with comments like this one:

	/** Some text
	
	@warning Description
	*/
	- (void)method;

Although all special blocks (warnings, bugs, examples and lists) are delimited with empty lines from preceding text, they are conceptually part of the same paragraph - they are converted to a paragraph item object and added to the same paragraph as preceding text. The reason for such handling is so that we can add such items to whatever paragraph - like @param or @return description etc. However when creating short description and tooltips for methods, the whole first paragraph (including all special blocks) was used. As from the users point of view, these are clearly delimited with empty line, the resulting documentation contained unexpected tooltips and short descriptions.

These situations are properly handled now and only the text part of the first paragraph up to the first special block is used for short description and tooltip! Thanks to ""BloodDragon"" for pointing it out!

*NOTE:* after implementing this part I noticed that special blocks were not rendered to the documentation in such cases if `--no-repeat-first-par` option was used. A bit more logic was required in such case, so appledoc now properly repeats omitted parts as a first paragraph of the description paragraphs of a comment!

Note that we only handle @see directives this way; any in-text local cross reference is not going to be reported as it simply won't be matched.

Note that even with this, we get ""false"" warnings as all local references are simply copied over unchanged and if the destination method's parent doesn't implement them, appledoc issues a warning.

In short: don't worry, appledoc is still free and will remain so, you can still use it, modify it as well as use generated documentation etc. for any kind of projects - free or commercial!

In long :) I'm primarily developer and don't care about legal stuff, so I didn't take much time to consider this part before. I always wanted to contribute to the community and open the tool to anybody with minimal constraints and will continue to do so in the future. But to prevent potential misuse in today's crazy money-oriented-regardless-of-consequences world :) I took some time to go through at least basic considerations of the way I want to see appledoc go in the future. After all the time I've invested in the tool, this seemed proper to do...

That being said, the main reason for switching from MIT to BSD is clearer text in BSD. But generally both licenses are practically the same and are among most liberal open source licenses :)

I did add one additional requirement to the license and that is to attribute appledoc in generated documentation, your website or similar. I think this is quite sensible and shouldn't interfere with open source-ness of the tool a bit.

The problem was two fold: template engine is specifically instructed to prevent any HTML escaping (otherwise using custom HTML tags within comment code wouldn't be possible), but this renders example blocks containing XML or HTML useless. To overcome this, example blocks are manually escaped by appledoc. Note that this required updating example blocks unit tests - changing to real settings provider as mock didn't do escaping...

Second: GBTokenizer marked HTML/XML opening comment marker `<!--` as a delimiter and removed it from the string, leaving only the remaining text. This interfered with example blocks processing later on. This was actually a bug as delimiter should only be considered a line containing ONLY delimiter chars (at present the regex used was matching only from start of line)!

Also added few more unit tests for validating example blocks prefixed with spaces are detected.

Increased build number to 525."

Considering this example (provided by ""PrimaryFeather"", appledoc would fail assigning the comment to the class:

	/** Class description */
	#ifdef __IPHONE_4_0
	@interface SPBitmapFont : NSObject <NSXMLParserDelegate>
	#else
	@interface SPBitmapFont : NSObject
	#endif

With this update, parses is able to attach the comment although with a twist by always assuming the first declaration as the valid one and ignoring all others. In other words: when using such solutions, make sure the first @interface (or @protocol) is the one you'd like to see in the generated documentation. For above example this means that documented class will list NSXMLParserDelegate as adopted protocol.

Note that to properly handle this the solution was to persist any encountered comments during parsing and only update them when new comments are detected. However this lead to situations that any found comment would be used for all subsequent objects in the same file. Therefore I had to add manual resetting of comments after assigning them to an object.

*Important:* Although all unit tests pass and generated documentation looks ok, this might require additional tweaking. Let's see if some more bug reports come..."

Oops. This one crept in while fixing #31 which added possibility to detect current directory if a path started with dot.

To solve the issue, GBMethodData merges argument names too: if only one part is commented, it uses names from that one, otherwise it keeps original names.

Logging source object only repeats the original id without adding any new information, so instead of doing that, we rather say we're merging from implementation. The whole idea relies on fact that header files are parsed before implementation files, so when we are merging we're merging implementation data into interface one. And in cases where there's no header file, we still need interface before implementation for compilers sake.

This has it's down sides in cases where interface is declared in a header file alphabetically sorted after implementation file, however in most cases we should be fine. To make things 100%, we should check declaredFiles value, however this would probably add significant overhead for a little gain..."

Since this option will generate brief description from the first sentence up to the first dot, ending the sentence with three dots actually puts the last two to the detailed section. To allow proper handling, the documentation for testing protocols was changed.

Also added the doxygen configuration file and documentation set info plist to the Xcode project so that we can modify them easily within the Xcode."

The problem became evident after adding documentation that included only :: and () as standalone ""words"". The code assumed this is also a valid member documentation, even though the name was empty string. The result was that the code replaced all occurences or :: or () with empty reference tag and as a consequence, ""real"" members which were supposed to be replaced afterwards (and validly started with :: or ended with ()), were left as they were since the original string was no longer found. This is properly handled now, which can be seen from the updated source documentation in the header file as well."

This makes the code more managable and clear, even in the future when additional fixes may be added."
