This PR modifies a third party module - I realize normally those should be fixed upstream, but I really doubt pthreads4w would a) consider it a valid bug and b) fix it. To make all my changes easily visible, I wrap them all in #if PCSX2_FIX.

This PR fixes a process exit routine in pthreads. This third party module exploits CRT initialization order to inject their initializer/deinitializer earlier than the others by putting their functions in .CRT$XCU and .CRT$XPU pseudo regions. The problem comes when a module gets build with dynamic CRT (/MD or /MDd), like most of PCSX2 plugins, it doesn't actually use .CRT$XPx regions as terminators, and instead lets dynamic CRT handle them.

This PR corrects this issue by registering the terminator via atexit, so it works with both static and dynamic CRT. This resolves an issue where SPU2-X plugin (and potentially more) leaks TLS handles when unloaded."

The adapter ID was needed to be passed before for a legacy DX9 hack which is no longer present, I figured it could cause a potential conflict when the adapter value stored at INI is outdated. (which is now a possibility after

The other alternative would be to just force set the INI value on dialog initialization to avoid unavailable values in the INI file, but that would be a rough for a person transitioning from debug build to release build using the reference device
option, so just removing this outdated variable for now, I rather doubt we'd be needing it in the future, in case we need adapter passing to subdialogs, the former suggestion needs to be implemented. Not implementing it right now since there's no need for it."

in vs 2019, the system xhash used by unordered_map uses Target in its template definition. pcsx2 #defines this in the r5900 and r3000 headers which leak cause a cryptic compilation error. A quick fix here is just to undef it in gamebase.h. A better fix would be to encapsulate the definition or use something more c++ to avoid the pre-processor. Add a comment to explain the _Target_ undef.

tap.h did not have string defined. I guess this was included transitively somewhere with an earlier set of system headers.

Biostools, the file is opened in text mode which causes the bios to be partially read. I'm not sure that's vs2019 specific but it's wrong in any case. Maybe the default mode parameter changed at some point. Maybe wxFile would be a better choice here rather than WxFFile because wxFile always open s in binary mode."

- Restrict directory checks to application basepath instead of current directory as current directly is changed at too man places
- Avoid some minor memory leaks by disposing some disposable elements

Note: Net framework requirement has been increased to 4.0 to run/compile the application."

The idea was to rework the current palette texture management to improve performances with games that uses multiple palettes for the same data texture.

The new management shows small to none performances improvement in almost every game in terms of FPS, and it lowers the GPU BUS usage by some percentage points in games like Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance (9% to 7%) which uses many palettes.

The hot topic is that the performances in Zone Of The Enders 2 skyrocketed (2x), because of the fact that the game uses many palettes and a small number of textures to render it's effects.

Only impacts custom resolution, there used to be a much weaker algorithm
which doens't consider scissor sizes and gives a minor performance boost
in costs of accuracy (which was used when large framebuffer was disabled
in custom resolutions)

I've removed this as the performance tradeoff is rather negligible after
the implementation of #1942 and the older one is no longer necessary.
Also added an extra parameter for considering the horizontal scissor,
I'm not sure where this might be useful so this is disabled in code for
now till I discover a testcase where this helps or run it on random data
ensuring it's working properly.

Also porting this to the general scaling function might help with memory
spikes which are experienced when large framebuffer is enabled."

Enhance the skipdraw hack by allowing skipdraw to skip a range of draw
calls.

For example: When the broken effects are at frames 90-100, the default
skipdraw always skips 0-100, possibly skipping several functioning
effects as well. By enhancing the skipdraw feature, it is now possible
to skip just frames 90-100.

For the example given above set the first box to 90 and the second box
to 100 to skip frames 90-100.

This isn't the right fix for this game, the text issue is caused due to a bug on GSdx depth test, and is not a
core issue. These rounding modes for some reason only partially alleviate the issue (https://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-GSDX-Software-mode-Bug-Report-Teen-Titans-Load-Game-menu-not-displaying-text-where-it-should)
while not fully fixing it, ZeroGS on the other hand doesn't have this issue even without these rounding mode changes.

TL;DR - Issue is on GS, and it's troublesome when a GS issue is masked like this.

Texture Shuffle changes:
Always Enable Texture shuffle on D3D10/11.
Previously Texture shuffle was enabled if CRC hack
level was below Full, this was kinda not good since
D3D also relies on CRC hacks on Full so you could either
stick with texture shuffle or crc hacks.

Texture shuffle is not supported on D3D9, however we can do a partial
port where instead of vertical lines with the effect we get the effect
on the entire screen. Better than nothing I suppose.

Ported some of the code from OpenGL to D3D
( just a copy - paste job :) ),
part of the code misses a dedicated shader but we can still
use it to fix various issues on many games.

List of affected games tested so far:
The Godfather, Final Fight Streetwise, The Suffering Ties that Bind,
Urban Chaos have their vertical lines issues fixed
(highly possible for other games as well), MGS and Stolen see an improvement
but they are still broken without crc hacks. Other games that suffered
similar issues are probably affected as well.

Channel Shuffle changes:
Update Channel Shuffle detection. A lot of games should see an improvement,
MGS, Urban Chaos, Stolen have their top left corner issues resolved.
Other games should be affected as well that use similar logic.
They still miss a shader so some effects are still broken/show glitches
but it's a nice improvement for D3D users.

Shared changes:
Texture Shuffle and Channel shuffle have been moved to their
own dedicated functions. Should make things a bit cleaner.

Move part of the code for Texture Shuffle to GSRendererHW to be shared
across all HW renderers, should aboid copy paste/duplicate code."

the scaling variancies.

Hence use the default rendering target buffer size for the load size
independent of the scaling values. I've also removed a buffer height saturation
code which seemed unreliable.

Note: The accurate version of the code can be enabled using the macro
provided in config.h (which is more intensive on resources), the current

likely have to do unless someone feels like porting over more of the

-Added a new installer function so that we can launch PCSX2 directly from the installer.

-Supressed some errors related to unused plugins in MakeNSIS.

-Replaced File with CreateDirectory function (for Cheats only) because it can't be used on an empty folder and will cause MakeNSIS to fail.

Split code in 2 parts
* Base class (GSWndEGL) that implement the core EGL and GL context
* Derived class (GSWndEGL_X11/GSWndEGL_WL) that implement the backend to handle native resources

Note: Most backend code is only useful for GSopen1/PS1 mode. GSopen2 only requires
the AttachNativeWindow implementation

Code is based around EGL_EXT_platform extension that allow to select the platform at runtime.
Note: I think the extension was integrated in EGL 1.5

The X11 backend was mostly converted to XCB
The wayland backend is only a placeholder for future code

I don't know if MS windows is/could be supported with EGL_EXT_platform API

Improved the video mode detection code by also detecting the DVD variant video modes of NTSC & PAL, PSX mode actually make use of these specific variants, as well as the BIOS. Previously, I just had them as a single bios video mode due to laziness. (I know, my bad)

After further research, it seems that these DVD variant modes have their own individual VSync timing values similar to the standard NTSC & PAL video modes, dealing with those timer codes might be essential in getting timing accuracy of the PSX mode games. (I kept it to default NTSC/PAL values for now, interested people can mess with it later)

I had planned to do this before but there some were concerns that two different video modes make use of 0x73 gate in SetGsCrt, which was rather weird (how the heck could two video modes be used in a single param value?)

 0x73- DVDPAL        ( 720 x  480 @ ??.???Hz)
 0x73- DVD480P       ( 720 x  480 @ ??.???Hz)

Hence, we had decided to use the CMOD bit from SMODE1 (AKA color subcarrier frequency) to detect whether it's an analog or digital video mode and update the necessary timing values but seems like it's no longer necessary, after further discussions from some PS2 developers, we've come to the conclusion that only DVDPAL is possible via 0x73 in SetGsCrt. (So I assume the DVD480p init possibility was fake info from Blue and those other GSM guys who were reverse engineering the PS2)"

Allow the output circuit saturation to take place at cases where one of the output circuit is enabled with frame mode rendering, I'm not sure it would be safe to allow saturations when both of the output circuits are enabled with frame mode rendering. Unlike field mode rendering, frame mode doesn't use identical rectangles at same co-ordinates for output in two alternating fields and potentially they could use a much bigger output size when both of the output circuits are enabled and are separated without any intersection. So let's limit the saturation to only the cases where we detect a single output circuit for frame mode rendering.

ICO uses a depth of field effect for the fog. Depth is extracted
into the alpha channel of a texture. And then used as blending factor.
You need a 1:1 texture/pixel mapping otherwise you will line at boundaries.

In order to extract the DoF, ICO moves the depth buffer around the GS
memory. Memory moves are implemented in the not-scaled world. It means
that we can't have the above 1:1 ratio. And we don't know anymore that
data are coming from the current depth buffer.

The solution: I reused an HLE channel shader to read the depth buffer directly.
This way I have the guarantee that pixel/depth are aligned.

Previously, the NTSC saturation was also applied for double scan mode (Interlaced and Frame) where the developers send double the height to the DISP registers, saturation shouldn't be performed at such cases as the developers could send a value of 780 while the real size of the output would be 390 due to double scan mode.

Previously, the combobox will reach an indeterminate state whenever it's passed with a value out of range via ComboBoxInit(). To avoid such cases, let's initialize the current selection of the combobox with the front element of the settings vector whenever we detect an out of range value which is not declared in the vector.

To reproduce the issue, set ""Renderer"" to some sort of crazy value like 50 in the GSdx.ini file and it'll mess up the whole GSdx plugin dialog really bad. This patch prevents such undesirable behavior by simply selecting the front element in the vector when we read an unsupported value."

Previous implementation saved the both the chain pointer and the chain size
Rational: size is useful to add new element and to detect the end of the chain
Vif cache is rarely miss. So 'add' is barely called and the end of a chain is
barely reached.

New implementation will add a null cell at the end of the chain. As a
cell contains a x86 pointer, if is null you could conclude that you
reach the end of the chain.

The 'add' function will traverse the chain to get the current size. It is
a cold path besides the chain is often short (< 4).

The 'find' function only need to check the startPtr bytes to detect the end
of the loop.

In the previous code, the threads were created and destroyed in the base
class constructor and destructor, so the threads could potentially be
active while the object is in a partially constructed or destroyed state.
The thread however, relies on a virtual function to process the queue
items, and the vtable might not be in the desired state when the object
is partially constructed or destroyed.

This probably only matters during object destruction - no items are in
the queue during object construction so the virtual function won't be
called, but items may still be queued up when the destructor is called,
so the virtual function can be called. It wasn't an issue because all
uses of the thread explicitly waited for the queues to be empty before
invoking the destructor.

Adjust the constructor to take a std::function parameter, which the
thread will use instead to process queue items, and avoid inheriting
from the GSJobQueue class. This will also eliminate the need to
explicitly wait for all jobs to finish (unless there are other external
factors, of course), which would probably make future code safer."

Previously, the code used a lot of ""bitwise AND"" to get specific bitfields of the interrupt mask control register, which makes the code look a bit hacky, also it's even more hard for normal people to calculate the value when hexadecimal values are used for the bitwise operations where the register is totally binary. Instead of dealing with all those mess, let's just get the bitfield values from the already implemented nice union of the IMR register. FWIW it also makes the code more readable."

The previous implementation of HPO adds an offset on vertex position. It
doesn't always work beside it moves the rendering window.

The new implementation will add a texture offset so that instead to sample
the middle of the GS texel, we will sample the middle of the real texture texel.

It must be manually enabled with
* UserHacks_HalfPixelOffset_New = 1 (keep a small offset as intended by GS effect)
* UserHacks_HalfPixelOffset_New = 2 (no offset)

It's rather unnecessary to use the same ioctls multiple times per disc
when the info returned doesn't change. Just use each ioctl once and
read/calculate all the necessary info all at onace.

This also fixes an issue where the IOCTL_DVD_START_SESSION ioctl is
repeatedly used if the returned session ID is 0. The previous code
assumed that 0 was not a valid session ID and would repeatedly use the
ioctl to obtain a non-zero session ID. However, 0 is a valid session ID,
and it seems IOCTL_DVD_START_SESSION can repeatedly return a 0 session
ID even if the corresponding IOCTL_DVD_END_SESSION has not been called.
In our case, a DVD session is only necessary for DVD detection and
reading the physical format information. This fix seems to alter drive
speed behaviour."

Newer wxWidgets versions call SetThreadUILanguage() on Windows, which
somehow causes our recursive mutex implementation to take ~1ms when
recursive locking occurs. So when a game boots up and the debugger is
loading the symbol map which can easily have 15000+ symbols, the GUI
locks up for 15+ seconds.

Switching to C++11 recursive mutexes seems to work around the issue. It
should be safe here since there's no direct interaction with the GUI.

Note: There is still a 1-2 second GUI lockup when booting a game on
Windows (it has existed for quite a while, and is more noticeable with
fast boot). It doesn't seem to affect Linux (or maybe it's harder to
detect)."

Game: harley davidson
* write tex0 ctx0
* write tex0 ctx1

Previous GSdx behavior will load the clut every write of TEX0. In the
above case the draw will take the wrong clut.

To be honest, it could be a wrong emulation on the EE core emulation.
The hardware likely got a single clut (1KB cache is quite expensive)
So clut loading must be skipped if the context is wrong.

Next draw will use the ctx1 clut so I apply TEX0 when the context is switched

Please test harley davidson :)

The vast majority of PCSX2 files use tabs for indentations, and all new
commits also use tabs for indents and not spaces. Therefore, having space
.editorConfig makes it extremely hard to work on PCSX2 files with editors
which support this config file.

There were some concerns that github will make things harder for us
with tabs at .editorConfig, and if that indeed becomes an issue then
we'll have to address it somehow. For now, let's hope it won't.

Also, commented out the line which automatically removes trailing
spaces, since it affects the entire file and therefore makes changes
which the committer did not intend to make at places unrelated to the
commit."

At higher resolutions it takes too much time to save a screenshot at the
maximum compression level. So let's allow the user to set the
compression level.

This re-uses the png_compression_level setting. The default compression
level is 1 for speed, but if the user wishes to increase the compression
level (without using an external tool) and doesn't mind if the
screenshot takes more time to save then they can increase the
compression level up to a maximum of 9 (which can take quite a while).

1. All POSIX shells support $(...) syntax [1], including /bin/sh. shellcheck
   warns about it.
2. [[ won't work in /bin/sh [2], so use [ everywhere. I wonder why it worked
   now, perhaps the test was running on a system where /bin/sh -> /bin/bash.
3. In POSIX sh, string indexing is undefined. [SC2039]. Unfortunately, this
   means we require a subprocess: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh. Very
   ugly.
4. In POSIX sh, arrays are undefined. We seem to use $flags as an array
   after constructing it by string concatenation. I tried to verify that
   this has the same effect as just passing the quoted string in bash:

      bash-3.2$ flags=""-DCMAKE_GOOK""
      bash-3.2$ flags=""$flags -DCMAKE_MOARMA""
      bash-3.2$ flags=""$flags -DCMAKE_URURURUR""
      bash-3.2$ ./argv $flags
      0: ./argv
      1: -DCMAKE_GOOK
      2: -DCMAKE_MOARMA
      3: -DCMAKE_URURURUR
      bash-3.2$ ./argv ""${flags[@]}""
      0: ./argv
      1: -DCMAKE_GOOK -DCMAKE_MOARMA -DCMAKE_URURURUR
      bash-3.2$ ./argv ""$flags""
      0: ./argv
      1: -DCMAKE_GOOK -DCMAKE_MOARMA -DCMAKE_URURURUR
      bash-3.2$

5. Enable exit on unknown variable (-u). All variables should be known,
   otherwise we have an error in the script. shellcheck doesn't warn so I
   think it's fine.

Apart from shellcheck(1), I also ran checkbashisms(1). The latter only
reported that ""command -v"" might not be available in other shells.
Apparently only ash(1) doesn't understand it.

NOTE: Why are we even trying to support pre-Mavericks (Darwin < 13) OSX? We
don't even support the most modern OSX (El Capitan) fully yet. OSX upgrades
are free and generally don't leave old machines behind. Most machines made
after 2009 can upgrade to El Capitan, AFAIK. I also believe that systems
that have all the utilities and libraries necessary to build PCSX2 will have
/bin/bash >= 3.x.

NOTE 2: Does cmake/ninja generate the same type of output in
compile_commands.json?

This could be quite annoying when checking a log while the game is

Also slightly modify the textual description of the other underclock items.

All previous values available at the slider are still there, but since
the new value is now the mildest (slider == -1), it ""pushes"" the previous
-1 and -2 values one notch down.

This restores the mildest value to be identical to how it behaved before
90b11b2f , which is measured as about 75% speed.

Because the ""balanced"" preset uses the -1 slider value, it means this
restored mild value is now also used by the balanced preset.

As a note, while the message for the mildest value was always ""reduce by
about 33%"", before 90b11b2f it was actually about 25% reduction (75% speed,
like with this commit now), and after that commit it was about 40% reduction
(60% speed).

Also, since we add new value to the slider only on one side, the ""0""
(default) slider position is now not at the exact middle. That's fine,
but maybe we could also add a milder overclock value on the other side
to have that symetric again."

The ee cyclerate percentage values at the slider text were inaccurate,
and sometimes wildely so.

Add some code to measure the actual speed at runtime (disabled by default)
and update the (static) slider text values according to the measurements.

Also change the description from increase/reduce ""by AA %"" to ""to BB %"".

This makes it slightly easier to grasp. E.g. ""reduce speed to 10%"" is
easier to grasp than ""reduce speed by 90%"", and similarly, ""increase
speed to 300%"" is easier to grasp than ""increase speed by 200%""."

While c782b62 added much more reliable game game startup detection, the
settings system did not yet gain that knowledge, but typically that's OK.

Typically the settings (and patches) are loaded according to the current
CRC, which happens once on bios boot (with general settings) and then again
when the game starts, which includes game-specific fixes, patches, etc.

However, if the setting are changed (and therefore also applied) after
the game CRC is known but before the game starts, such as if the user
presses Tab to change framelimiter while at the bios, then until now it
was accidentally applying the game's settings while still at the bios.

This commit makes the settings routine know whether or not the game actually
started, and apply the generic/game settings accordingly."

Commit 330704a added code which applies the patches before recompiling the
elf entry block, but because at that stage the patches for the current
CRC were not yet loaded, effectively it did nothing.

Now it actually loads the patches before applying them.

As a result, it should now be possible for patches (with place=0) to be
effective before the elf is executed.

This is a hack, because the emulation loads the patches while it's not
paused. It works, but it's not great. A better way would be to pause the
emulation once the entry point is detected, then make the setting get
applied normally (which also loads the patches normally), and then resume
the emulation.

This _should_ properly fix #627 (the test case works as expected now)."

patches and cheats are exactly the same (pnach style patch line) but we
stored two sets of them depending on their source: ""patches"" for
GameIndex.dbf patches, and ""cheats"" for all the rest (cheats, widescreen,
etc).

Unify patches and cheats and keep only ""patches"", cleanup and rename the
public API at Patch.h, and add documentation.

Also: add some console messages on invalid ""place"" value, and when we skip
searching cheats_ws.zip because a pnach file was found at cheats_ws dir.

Also: removed checks before applying different kinds of patches/cheats
because we don't need them (we didn't have disabled patches loaded anyway).

The checks removal _shouldn't_ have any effect, except that the checks were
wrong and accidentally prevented loading widescreen hacks which have a place
value of 0. No one probably noticed it since all the widescreen patches
which I looked at have a place value of 1. So now ws patches with place=0
would load correctly too. If we'll ever have such."

If cheats are enabled and loaded (pnatch files from the cheats folder, or
from the cheats_ws folder, or from cheats_ws.zip), then they were still
applied for some time while rebooting the emulation after a game is already
loaded (e.g. start pcsx2, boot fast, play, boot full). This could cause
the reboot to fail if some patches were applied (e.g. widescreen patches).

It seems that the offending application of the cheats happens at
SysCoreThread::VsyncInThread(), which possibly runs before the config
change event is handled (and re-load the cheats for the current crc).

So reset/invalidate the cheats when the VM is reset.

This should improve issue #851, but ultimately not fully fix it, since
the patches (from games db) are not reset yet with this commit, and we
don't have a function to do so. For now the non-cheats patches are only
reset/reloaded when a configuration change is being handled.

It would probably be a good thing if we can unify patches/cheats."

The TLS buffers used by the FastFormatUnicode and FastFormatAscii

1111e039011c769f6ccaeb4b3b6463fbf8467768, using CDVDgigaherz without a
disc, possibly other conditions).

When PCSX2 shut downs and the FastFormatBuffers are being cleaned up,
the call to pthread_key_delete() would end up calling
WaitForSingleObject(e, INFINITE) and waiting indefinitely for an event
to trigger. It never does get triggered (for reasons unknown) and
therefore PCSX2 doesn't terminate properly.

fixes the termination issue on Windows and doesn't seem to have much
effect on performance."

The hypothesis is that game will use a depth (aka Z32/Z24/Z16/Z16S)

a standard color format but block/pixel order won't be the same.
(otherwise I'm screwed)

=> Hypothesis invalid on GoW. They just do a scrambled rendering...

Lookup info:
* The first searched list is the depth pool as we search a depth
  texture.
* 2nd one is the render target pool (if a depth was converted to a
  render target already)

To avoid any CPU overhead, the source will be a pointer to the real texture
* Conversion (if float texture) will be done on the fly by the shader (GPU).
* Relative rescaling won't be supported. Texture must be fetched with
  integral coordinate"

This reverts commit 53690cf9d06b8e1883bfdb487ad837f1d98b0a21.

Quoting user:

 For aliasing, the option allow of reduce a little but always very
 visible compared with DX11 even with anisotropic OFF, , furthermore
 many textures bug added with option activated (predictable but not see
 on DX11 with anisotropic ON).

TL;DR doesn't worth it.

Note: it seem to work on DX because DX uses HW texturing in clamp region
mode (and others invalid case). OpenGL uses SW texturing to ensure accuracy"

Texture coordinate could be dummy/float/int integral/int normalized.

Old behavior:
* VS was in charge to select the texture coordinate
* int integral format wasn't supported

New behavior:
* Always compute all formats
* FS will be in charge to select the good format

Impact:
* VS will be slightly slower but it reduces shaders permutation from
   little to 0 (won't be bad for CPU)
* FS speed isn't impacted as 2 separate code paths were already required
  to support both format
* Rasterizer will be 33% slower but unlikely to be the limited factor of
  the GPU
* In future we could directly use the integral format in the FS.

The old implementation saved the current value of a GSSetting as uint in
a field called 'id'. The  implementation of GSSettings suggests that
GSSettings  could be saved in a database with id as primary key. This
would require a translation look up from id to value but  could have all
advantages of a database. However the interface to GSSetting was never
implemented like that.

In the new implementation GSSetting has a 'value' field that stores an
int representative value of the desired state. Additionally the
constructor is 'overloaded' as template to reduce casting in the
consumer code. However all consumer values need to be castable to int.

Accordingly combobox initialization was adjusted."

It's now possible to press ESC once to pause, and ESC again to resume (or assign
any other key via PCSX2_keys.ini, e.g. to SPACE).

Note that resume only works if the GS window is NOT set to hide on pause (Emu
options -> GS Window), and if the key is pressed while the GS window is focused.

This includes two related changes:
- The command name at PCSX2_keys.ini is now changed to Sys_SuspendResume.
- If the GS window is NOT set to hide on pause, then it stays focused on pause.

Only relevant if the GS window is set to NOT hide when paused. At this case

The hack relies on the undefined behavior of the hardware so it can
potentially generate rendering corruption.

Alpha is a direct copy of the fragment. Normally masked bits will be constant
everywhere (RT, FS output, texture cache) so it would likely work.

15ms latency is too little most of the time, but if the stars align (light game,
fast system, the correct audio output module - portaudio comes to mind), it
might work well/reasonably, so allow it.

Watch the console for stretcher related messages. If you hear bad audio (clicks
etc) or notice reset/underruns messages, it means the latency is too low. The
optimal behavior (stretching is locked to 1:1) is when a message ""stretch: None (1:1)""
shows at the console, which isn't followed by a message ""stretch: Dynamic"" or
resets or spu2 underruns.

I'm pretty sure such low latency with good performance (mostly locked to 1:1)
was not possible in the past, but it seems possible (sometimes) now. Maybe the
previous ""black magic"" commit helps

The default is still 100ms which is still fine for most cases.

This commit affects Windows. Linux still has a different minimum, probably
mostly due to UI/constants. Maybe someone should test and change that too."

I don't have a fully scientific explanation here, but it seems that with big
buffers (~200ms and up), the stretcher adjustment can overshoot the target
equilibrium back and forth, in effect never stabilizing.

This commit makes it change slightly slower which somehow seems to improve its
behavior. Sorry for not having a better explanation, as at this stage tuning the
stretcher has become somewhat of a black magic.

But hey, if it works...

Tested with buffers from 30ms to 1000ms, and with playback speed and speed
changes between 30% and 500%, and as far as I can tell it only makes it better.

Fingers crossed."

The EE/IOP and VUs panels were disabled completely when presets are enabled,

re-enabling them (when disabling presets) didn't un-gray-out the static text.

This is likely a wxWidgets bug, but we can avoid it by just enabling/disabling
all items explicitly (and keeping the panels themselves always enabled).

For these panels, this means adding explicit enable/disable of the he EE-cache
checkbox and the Restore-Defaults buttons.

The issue doesn't seem to happen on other panels (though some earlier revisions
apparently also had this issue for the static text at the game fixes panel, but
apparently it's not an issue now)."

1. Add GS_Renderer Enum

Replace all instances of int/uint32 renderer identifier by a strongly
typed enum and appropriate casts.

Only instances in GS[*].cpp/h classes were touched. GPU[*].cpp/h classes
do not to follow the same convention.

2. Add default renderer according to OS

The default renderer is OS dependent (Win -> Dx9HW, others -> OGLHW).
Consequently one should always check againt the appropriate default
value on config load.

The old behaviour was only - if a at all - problematic if the respective
element in the gsdx.ini was missing and probably even then didn't create
issues. The current implementation is still more stable and does not
depend on the implementation of GS.cpp -> GetConfig()"

When X autorepeat is enabled, it will generate down/up, down/up, ... sequences

So it was decided to disable it. Unfortunately the configuration is for

ASSERT or EXCEPTION)

Initially the plugin handles the event from the X loop. However since
the GSopen2 switch events are already intercepted by the WX core GUI.
The core will route them back to the input plugin.

Wx filters automatically generated event so initial sequence is now
down, down, down/up. No more autorepeat issue, so no need to screw up

Make this more systematic by only mapping one shortcut to this API, and then
deriving the other two from it amd mapping them too automatically.

are always parsed and set correctly, but the letter ends up upper case if any

This patch fixes 3 different issues for wx event key codes and the ini parser.
- The ini parser (for PCSX2_keys.ini) parses symbols and letters correctly,
  but parsed `shift-q` as `Q` without shift. Now it's parsed as `q` with shift.
- the wx event keycode has the shift flag set correctly, but always has the
  upper case code for letters (e.g. `Q` when `q` was pressed, and `Q` with shift
  flag when shift-q is pressed). Now uses lower case for letters.
- For symbol-only keys (e.g. `-` or `=`), the keycode is the MS VK_.. thingy,
  e.g. for `=` it passed 187 instead of 61, or for `.` it had 190 instead of 46.
  Now returns the ascii code where possible (assuming US KB layout).

Also, when the DevCon is enabled, all key presses are printed to the console in
a format which could be copied to pcsx2_keys.ini, so this should allow also
non-US KBs to be set up for arbitrary symbols.

It should now be possible to use letters and symbols at PCSX2_keys.ini or as
default accelerators definitions within the code.

Note: this should have supposedly been fixed at r4918 ( 851bfba ), but neither
that build from the buildbot archive, nor the official 1.2.1 release (r5875),
nor the current builds have this working, which is really weird (tested on win8)"

<GSdx string>  - (e.g. GSdx OGL HW | 514x224 | None)
<output mode>  - Progressive/Interlaced (Frame/Field)
<limiter mode> - Limiter: None/Turbo/Slomo/Normal
<speed info>   - Speed: <100-based-percentage> (<vfps>)
<CPU usage>    - EE: <%> | GS: <%> | VU <%> | UI: <%>
<save state>   - State: <slot-number>

This patch changes the following to this order and format:
- Move the save state value to the front since it's actually useful.
- The speed value, which now includes the limiter value if not ""Normal"".
- Then the CPU usage parts, but the UI value only shows on debug/devel builds.
- The output mode, shortened to Frame/Field-i/p
- the GSdx string same as before only at the end

So all the info is still there as before (except UI), but more readable format.

E.g. before (normal limiter and turbo limiter):
GSdx D3D11 HW | 640x512 | None | Interlaced (frame) | Limiter: Normal | Speed: 100% (50.01) | EE:  43% | GS:   4% | UI:   0% | State 0
GSdx D3D11 HW | 640x512 | None | Interlaced (frame) | Limiter: Turbo | Speed: 443% (221.31) | EE:  99% | GS:  16% | UI:   0% | State 0

E.g. after (normal limiter and turbo limiter) for the same values as above:
State 0 | Speed: 100% (50.01) | EE:  43% | GS:   4% | frame-i | GSdx D3D11 HW | 640x512 | None
State 0 | Speed (Turbo): 443% (221.31) | EE:  99% | GS:  16% | frame-i | GSdx D3D11 HW | 640x512 | None"

This fixes the following issues when custom resolution is selected.
 - When the width is smaller than the native resolution width, the
   texture cache targets are removed on every Vsync signal, causing a
   black screen issue.
 - The texture cache code needs a 1 returned for the custom resolution
   upscale multiplier or there'll be some really funny graphical issues.

It also removes unnecessary GetConfig (which I think unconditionally
does a a file read on Windows) calls if the width was increased - the
upscale multiplier is already stored, and the custom resolution width
and height calls are now unnecessary.

Also fix some whitespace issues."

Before this patch, when recording Progressive (frame) mode, it recorded all
the frames correctly but set the clip's fps property to 25/29.97, so when
played back it played at half the speed (but was fine when played at double speed).

This patch does not affect the number of frames recorded per second, but rather
only sets the resulting clip fps property to the correct one (double than before).

Also fixes a bug that in a non-managed window in progressive mode, the title
displayed ""200%"" speed when it should have displayed 100% speed.

In order to flush data with some delay after save-to-memory-card, the code was
calling sioNextFrame() on each frames (60 times/s) continuously as long as the
emulation is active, regardless if FMC is in use or if memory cards in general
are in use.

Further to that, each call to sioNextFrame calls 8 times into the memory card
plugin even if FMC is not in use, resulting in overall ~500 calls/sec with the
sole goal of facilitating delayed flush after MCD save with folder memory cards.

This patch is a hack to call it once per second instead of 60 per second, but we
need to remove this call completely.

The delayed flush will now happen after 60-120 frames instead of exactly 60."

Generally only one letter is used for the more common languages; English etc.
So is the case in this PR.

For some PAL-M2 entries in particular, though maybe also for some PAL-M3 entries, there can be 2 or more discs of the same game having this code; it's not necessarily a disc specific code - it only tells how many languages the disc supports.

restores the values however they're defined as defaults for AppConfig.

Note that other than these two panels, the speedhacks panel is the only other

Comment below from Jonathan Li

On my system, /dev/input/event13 (evdev interface) and /dev/input/js0 (joystick interface) correspond to the DS3 on my system. User/group ownership are both root.

With /dev/input/event13 at 0640 and /dev/input/js0 at 0644 - SDL2 detects no pad, SDL1 detects a 19 button, 27 axis pad

With /dev/input/event13 at 0666 and /dev/input/js0 at 0644 - Both SDL1 and SDL2 report a 19 button, 4 axis pad.

SDL2 only uses the evdev interface, SDL1 uses the evdev interface but if that fails, it uses the joystick interface."

This means that we are now no longer touching files that haven't technically been written to. Some games use timestamp information to automatically highlight the save that was last written to, so this should fix a small but annoying bug where it would highlight the wrong one.

Do note that while there is a much simpler check that looks like this:
	// Remove (== don't flush) all memory card pages that haven't actually changed.
	for ( auto oldIt = m_oldDataCache.begin(); oldIt != m_oldDataCache.end(); ++oldIt ) {
		auto newIt = m_cache.find( oldIt->first );
		assert( newIt != m_cache.end() ); // if this isn't true something broke somewhere, the two maps should always contain the same pages
		if ( memcmp( &oldIt->second.raw[0], &newIt->second.raw[0], PageSize ) == 0 ) {
			m_cache.erase( newIt );
		}
	}
	m_oldDataCache.clear();
It can fail in edge cases that don't actually seem too unlikely. Imagine a save being deleted, and then a new save from the same game but in a different slot being created quickly afterwards. It seems quite possible that the new save's file data then occupies the exact same pages as the old save's, and since it's from the same game it might be close enough to where a page sized section (juse 0x200 bytes!) matches the data from the old save that previously resided in that location -- which would cause this code to throw away and not flush this data! It's a shame too, since this variant would be a few ms faster as well, but I feel it's better to be safe than sorry here."

This currently works for a lot of games, but fails in edge cases where
the game disc's serial does not match the game serial that is written to
the memory card as part of the save file's directory name. This affects
mostly (only?) games that have multiple discs. We could circumvent this
by adding a ""save game serial"" or something into the GameDatabase which
tells us what we should filter by for those cases.

needing to be defined before they're usable.

FolderMemoryCard: Implement Open().

FolderMemoryCard: Implement GetSizeInfo().

FolderMemoryCard: Implement some basic structure of Read()

FolderMemoryCard: Implement parts of Read() and Save().

Shouldn't it be Write() or Load()? Anyway, this doesn't work yet, but it
gets part of the formatting procedure done which is at least something!

FolderMemoryCard: Add method to calculate ECC.

FolderMemoryCard: Start implementing the FAT.

MemoryCard: More logging.

FolderMemoryCard: Formatting works now!

Formatted memory card isn't actually recognized as formatted yet because I don't store folder metadata yet, but we're getting there!

FolderMemoryCard: Recognize when it's trying to access a data cluster.

FolderMemoryCard: Add directory/file entry support.

On further inspection this might not a be a good way to handle erasing.

FolderMemoryCard: Method to get a file entry and file path from a file's data cluster.

FolderMemoryCard: wxDirName is garbage, let's just use wxFileName for the folder too...

FolderMemoryCard: Fix Erase method.

FolderMemoryCard: Start implementing file writes.

This is still quite broken but we're getting somewhere here!

FolderMemoryCard: Load the data from the host file system into the memory card on emulation start.

Also store superblock to host file system on end.

FolderMemoryCard: Fix a few warnings.

FolderMemoryCard: Implement file reads.

FolderMemoryCard: Proper ECC reads.

FolderMemoryCard: Reads to unmapped locations should return all 0xFF.

FolderMemoryCard: Some sort of working WriteToFile.

(Note: Doesn't always work depending on what order data gets written...)

FolderMemoryCard: Forgot a 'b' for reading files in binary mode. Whoops.

FolderMemoryCard: Load timestamps from the host filesystem.

FolderMemoryCard: r+b needs the file to exist so create if it doesn't.

FolderMemoryCard: Failsafe to allow non-sequential writes.

FolderMemoryCard: Use a cache for writes. Does not flush to host FS yet!

FolderMemoryCard: Flush the data written to the cache to the host file system on exit.

FolderMemoryCard: Since we have a cache now, remove code related to formatting, it's no longer needed.

FolderMemoryCard: More binary file mode mistakes...

FolderMemoryCard: Make it actually possible to disable/eject cards.

FileMemoryCard: Revert changes made for logging data.

FolderMemoryCard: Remove excessive logging.

MemoryCard: Note that the superblock struct is no longer unused.

FolderMemoryCard: A disabled card shouldn't try writing data on exit.

FolderMemoryCard: Log when flushing data.

FolderMemoryCard: Replace plain constants with const variables.

Should make it easier in the future to change the memory card size, if
needed.

FolderMemoryCard: Sort of handle the case when the total size of files in the memory card folder exceed the size of the card.

Not elegant but prevents ugly errors. The file that caused the card to
""overflow"" will be seen as corrupted data by the PS2 browser.

FolderMemoryCard: Some sanity checks.

FolderMemoryCard: superBlock member really should have that m_ too to be consistent.

MemoryCard: Switch back to FileMemoryCard for merging.

FolderMemoryCard: Implement GetCRC() via a timestamp of the last memory card write.

Reasoning:
Regarding auto-ejecting on save load, I see that the current
implementation checks that by comparing memory card CRC and reinserting
if it mismatches. Since it's actually just about seeing if the memory
card state of the savestate and the current state match, my GetCRC() now
returns a millisecond timestamp of the last time the card was written
to. This should work out to the intended result, though I had to use
wxGetLocalTimeMillis() instead of wxGetUTCTimeMillis() since the latter
isn't available for some reason.

Fix GCC warnings and error.

MemoryCard: Switch implementations via a #define.

FolderMemoryCard: Add a NextFrame() method that should be called once per frame. Flushes written data to the host file system after a certain amout of frames have passed without any writes (currently 60).

MemoryCard: Add the NextFrame() method to the plugin API.

Counters: If the FolderMemoryCard is selected, inform it every frame in VSyncEnd() that a frame has passed.

VSyncEnd: Probably better to inform the memory card before the frame limiting.

Fix error when using wxWidgets >= 3.0.

FolderMemoryCard: Extract into its own .h/.cpp files.

FolderMemoryCard: Change cache to a map to reduce memory usage.

FolderMemoryCard: More gracefully handle lack of space when adding files."

GS doesn't supports texture shuffle/swizzle so it is emulated in a
complex way.

The idea is to read/write the 32 bits color format as a 16 bit format.
This way, RG (16 lsb bits) or BA (16 msb bits) can be read or written with
square texture that targets pixels 1-8 or pixels 8-16.
However shuffle is limited. For example you can copy the green channel
to either the alpha channel or another green channel.

Note: Partial masking of channel is not yet implemented

V2: improve logging
V3: better support of green channel in shader
V4: improve detection of destination (issue due to rounding)"

Please test it!

GS supports 3 formats for the output:

32 bits: normal case
=> no change

24 bits: like 32 bits but without alpha channel
=> mask alpha channel (ie don't write it anymore)
=> Always uses 1.0f as blending coefficient

16 bits: RGB5A1, emulated by a 32 bits openGL texture. I think it will be more correct to use
a real 16 bits GL texture. Unfortunately it would cost several (slow) target conversions.
Anyway as a current solution
=>  apply a mask of 0xF8 on color when SW blending is used (improve Castlevania shadow)
unfortunately normal blending mode still uses the full range of colors!

This commit also corrects a couple of blending factor. 128/255 is equivalent to 1.0f in PS2, whereas GPU uses 1.0f. So the blending factor must be 255/128 instead of 2

Note: disable CRC hack and enable accurate_colclip to see Castlevania shadow ^^
(issue #380).
Note2: SW renderer is darker on Castlevania. I don't know why maybe linked to the 16 bits format poorly emulated"

When the RT is used as an input texture, we need to rescale it.

Previous behavior was to always uses a linear filtering (more smooth).
Unfortunately it broke some games that expected an exact value like Star Ocean 3

This commit will disable the linear filtering in normal filtering mode (filter = 0
or filter = 2)

This way, shadow of Star Ocean 3 will appear correctly in upscaling (not
100% perfect but can't do better)

The purpose of the code is to support alpha channel
of RT uses as an index for a palette texure.

I'm afraid that code will likely break pure palette texture. Only used
if paltex is enabled

It fixes missing shadow in Star Ocean 3 (issue #374) in Native resolution
with filter = 0  (no filtering) or = 2 (normal fitering)

Rendering explanation:
The game emulates a stencil buffer with the alpha channel

The alpha channel of the RT can contains a palette texture index (format 4HH)
The idea is to have a gradient of value in the palette (16/32/48/...).
This way you can implement a +16/-16 and even wrap the alpha value every time
you hit the pixel.

Bilinear filtering breaks the rendering because it interpolates between counts
so you doesn't have the exact count

Upscaling breaks the rendering because the RT is reused as an input texture. It means
that we need to scale it down which again create some interpolations."

The Restore-Defaults button and the Presets checkbox are inherently conflicting
since both of them apply (different) sets of values to the speed hacks, however
the Preset also applies values to other panels.

Now the relation between the Defaults button and Preset is consistent with
other panels (EE/VU) where Defaults already got disabled when Presets is used.

Before this patch (and also before the previous one which fixed the locking),
clicking restore-defaults while Presets was checked resulted in incorrect state
where Preset is checked but the speed hacks are both unlocked and also didn't
necessarily match the selected preset. Now this can't happen."

When speed hacks are disabled, clicking Apply should keep the panel grayed-out,
but it didn't before (though it was still correctly locked/unmodifyable).
With this patch it also looks correctly grayed out.

It's not clear if it's a wxWidgets issue or pcsx2 issue since with wxWidgets 3
there doesn't seem to be an issue (see posts at issue #543).

Regardless, this patch makes a cleaner separation between widgets values
([un]checked etc) and widgets states - lock(grayed-out)/unlocked.

The patch only modifies when widgets are grayed and should not affect the actual
values (therefore should not change the behavior other than visuals), but do
keep an eye for weird behavior since this is sensitive code.

Should fix #543"

there was already code for this, but it was broken due to:
- the message is WM_SYSCOMMAND and wParam is SC_SCREENSAVE etc.
- GSPanel doesn't get WM_SYSCOMMAND - GSFrame does.
- also disabled screen saver while paused if not set to hide the GS window.
- it's an ugly hack where windows keeps trying to activate the screen saver
  every few seconds but such code prevents it (Lilypad has the same hack).

the new code uses windows API which was designed for this.

the screen saver is now disabled while the window is focused and the emulation
is running. it's on by defauly and without GUI - the same as with normal games.

this patch addresses Windows only, but adds a placeholder for future
implementations for other platforms."

Some post-processing updates.

- Fixed an old overlooked typo (scalar:scaler)
- Specified some function parameters as input only, for compiler's sake.
- Improved interpolation of the BlendGlow bloom type between light and dark pixels.
- Added a brightpass filter to the bloom to specifiy a light threshold that the bloom will affect.
- Improved some cross processing curve logic.
- Added pre luminance scaling before tone mapping takes place.
- Added both LDR & HDR variants to the tone map options.
- Removed clamping of the tone mapping output.
- Rearranged output of the gamma correction, for a more accurate transition of effects.
- Updated some option descriptions.
- Added the 'BloomCutoff' setting which can a alter the threshold offset for the bloom.
- Adjusted a few option defaults to compensate for logic changes."

Even before this pull request it was required to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH
when cross compiling since pkg-config always searches for native
libraries. This would require to backup an already existing ENV
variable if present, detect the distro specific place the pkgconfig folder is,
and restore the original ENV variable if it was present. Cmake as shown in:
.
http://www.cmake.org/gitweb?p=cmake.git;a=commitdiff;h=3df51470
.
added support for this but requires CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION as 3.1
which is kind of strict since it was released 10 days ago.
.
To avoid the ugliness let just avoid pkg-config when cross compiling. This
means only EGL, SDL2 and GTK3 have to be updated since the rest work w/o
pkg-config.
- EGL is fixed with PR #409
- SDL2 is fixed here and it's trivial.
- GTK3 is non-trivial. For this one use pkg-config for native builds since
  the .pc file is kept up to date automatically. For cross compilation
  use the provided FindGTK3 which I made by using the sed documented
  inside the file and updating the dependencies for GTK3. Since I checked
  each and every single .pc file to make sure they are up to date this
  should have the same behaviour as pkg-config. Prefer the .pc files for
  native builds since it does not need to be manually updated and when
  the native 64bit port gets finished all the cross compile options should
  be removed which is quite easy since most of the code got moved to the
  CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE.

Cmake Modules are BSD-3-clause therefore GPL compatible."

detecting the 64bit libraries and telling the users the 32bit libraries were

FindGTK2 test searches lib64 first then lib32/lib. These values are hardcoded.

The official way that cmake does cross compiling is via the use of a
CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE. This has to be given by the user and can't be
included from within a Cmake file since setting up the toolchain has
to be the first thing that happens.

After the file is given and validated cmake behaves nicely and all the
workarounds and hacks are not really needed anymore.

The consequence of this change is that without this file cmake will
try to build for the HOST architecture as expected and with the file
it will build for the TARGET architecture of the given toolchain. Due to
this remove 64BIT_BUILD_DONT_WORK and just ERROR out if the user tries
in the same way as before."

Instead of using some dynamic code to grab the FXSave information, use an intrinsic if on at least MSVC 2012.
With GCC just use a bit of ASM, and if on MSVC 2010 or older, use the old crappy method.

This method can be removed once MSVC 2010 support is dropped and mandate at least MSVC 2012 minimum."

This won't fix the billions of errors that will happen at runtime of using the x86 emitter, but chooses to make some better coding practice choices

in the xIndirectVoid class, instead of using s32 for the offset, use sptr which will be 32bit or 64bit depending on architecture.
This also fixes a few alignment issues in xAddressVoid's constructors.

In EmitSibMagic we are casting a void* to s32, which won't work on x86_64, so first do a cast from sptr to s32.
Won't work on x86_64, but gets us compiling."
