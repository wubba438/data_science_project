When running the tests in ruby 2.5, a lot of warnings are generated
about ::Fixnum being deprecated, caused by the redis gem.

This updates the redis gems in our various gemfiles to avoid the
deprecation message.

Because redis-rb has gained a major version, I've split the changes:

* Main and rails51 gemfiles: latest redis-rb
* rails41 gemfiles: minimum supported version containing the deprecation
  fix (3.3.3)

To achieve this I've locked the rails41 gemfiles at redis-rb 3.3.3
(instead of using >=), so it's clear we want them to stay at the minimum
supported version possible.

I've allowed the redis-namespace versions to jump to the latest version
in all gemfiles since all gemfiles were already on a version well past
the specified minimum."

In the Rails 5.1 appraisal group, the following warning is generated:

    in <top (required)> at
    /Users/simon/dev/clones/vanity/test/dummy/config/route

This is because of the wildcard route in the dummy test app:

    match ':controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))', :via => [:get, :post]

To avoid this message, this change explicitly enumerates the routes used
by the dummy app. This is a mild hassle, but could be reduced in future
if vanity were turned into a rails engine, meaning most of the routes
would be provided directly by the gem."

Currently the redis adapter's #destroy_experiment method only removes
experiment metadata; all participant data is retained even if the
experiment is reset. This can lead to large numbers of old keys hanging
around in redis instances, requiring manual cleanup.

This change uses redis's SCAN command[1] to delete all keys matching the
experiment prefix, which should completely reset the experiment.

The SCAN command inherently works in batches, each time returning a
cursor value that can be used in subsequent calls; when the cursor ""0""
is returned, the scan is complete.

In Rails 5 the `render` method deprecated a number of options including
the `nothing` option [1] (this option was removed entirely in Rails
5.1).

Previously vanity relied on this method for implementing its
`add_participant` controller endpoint.

Rather than using `render nothing: true`, we can use the `head` method
if we do not require a body in the response.

**Notes**

It looks like the `head` method is available in all versions of Rails
supported by Vanity (including Rails 3.2).

Multi-valued metrics were introduced some time ago[1], but the public API
supporting them (Metric#values, which returns values binned by date) has only
ever returned a single value per day.[2]

Currently the different adapters' implementations of #metric_values behave
differently for multi-valued metrics.

* The mock and mongodb adapters return an array per day, with the totals for
  each metric value seen per day
* The redis adapter returns an array summing only the first metric value seen
  per day, as a string
* The ActiveRecord adapter returns an array containing the sum of *all* values
  seen per day

While I think this may be completely unused behaviour, I can't rule out
third-party code that uses multi-valued metrics, so for the time being I'm
loosening the test to ignore multi-valued metrics, and ensuring that the Redis
adapter returns integers instead of strings.

Ruby 2.2 introduced a change into how default arguments are parsed[1].

Now when you wish to use a method as a default argument you need to be
explicit by using parenthasis.

For example

`def bar(foo=foo)`

will need to be re-written

`def bar(foo=foo())`

This commit introduces a fix for this issue.

*Note* I initially looked into updating the specs (to use ruby 2.2.0),
however I ran into a number of issues with the appraisal test suite and
older versions of rails.

* Avoid loading ActionController/ActionMailer::Base until they're needed
* Avoid loading ActiveRecord::Base until it's needed

A big part of the reason for the slowness is due to plugins referencing parts of Rails that don't necessarily need to be loaded, so, eg, ActiveRecord::Base gets pulled in even when just trying to run 'rake routes'. As of Rails 3.0, this can be avoided using on_load hooks.

method suitable for the type of experiment you want to define, or call the
generic define method (previously: experiment method).  For example:

  ab_test ""My A/B test"" do
	  alternatives :a, :b
	end

The experiment method is no longer overloaded: it looks up an experiment
(loading its definition if necessary), but does not define an experiment.
The ab_test method is overloaded, though this may change in the future.

the default any more."

Instead of global set by the filter we use a block to calculate the identity from within the experiment, allowing experiments to work differently (e.g. one experiment will use user's id, another may use project id).

Also A/B test experiment methods are now choose and conversion! (was choise and converted)."
