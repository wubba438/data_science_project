* [refactor] Refactor ticker to allow for variable number of character lists

This is a backward incompatible change in preparation for major release 2.

Supporting variable number of character lists have several advantages.
1. We don't have to specify the animation behavior from all possible characters.
2. Characters that do not exist in any character list can be treated differently by the animator.
   e.g. always prioritize preserving them via ACTION_SAME so they do not get animated.
3. Can support more custom animation behavior since each character list gets priority over the previous.
   e.g. [0, 1, 2] dictates animation behavior from 0 to 2, but what if I want a different behavior
   from 1 to 2? I can provide another character list that's something like [1, 3, 2].
4. Can support wrapping around behavior where 9 -> 0 properly wraps around the list rather than
   going all the way down. This is currently not possible because wrap-around in the current
   scenario would mean it would animate through all of the non-number characters (e.g. `$`).

* feedback

- Changed computation in `LevenshteinUtils` to append to single list
rather than doing array copy.
- Changed public API for character list to be a `String` rather than
`char[]`.

* convert to int based loops

* change comment on setText, will do another diff to update all of the
docs once I do release"
