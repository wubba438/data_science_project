Requires some hackery in the 'preload' logic. Fixes #67

Essentially, don't actually preload a file if we've seen it before, and use the `onload` event of the first one to fire off the onload event of all that are similar. Then once it's loaded, go back to caching it since it'll be fast (and we don't have a callback to kick it off). Tests added to make sure this works. Quite a bit of code for a simple feature, but we made some room..."

* 'v1.1' of github.com:SlexAxton/yepnope.js:
  function execWhenReady no longer needed now that css will be in a plugin. \o/
  Pulled out css logic, moving to a plugin.
  Fixed logic error in detecting css extension.
  took attr setting out of preload since it can ruin it too easily. Using setAttribute until i find a reason not to.
  Adding in pluggable attributes on elements.
  Exposing injection methods as cleanly as possible
  Adding cross domain css support for IE. Required an inference. Looking into other solutions.
  Switched all preloading over to images except for gecko, which still needs an object. When using images to preload resources, we can load them off of the DOM, yielding a huge performance boost (for browsers supporting it). More work needs to be done on it though, IE is loading CSS twice for some reason.
  CSS Rewrite / Optimizations for 1.1. Fixes timeout fallback from firing on cross domain css in webkit. Added test for cross domain css timeout.
  Converted php files to nodejs. Added express app as run.js to run unit tests locally. More work to come.
  Fixed an issue in css.php so the test suite handles query strings.
  Small tweaks for minification safety in Modernizr.load and IE. Credit to Kenneth Kufluk for the fix. Pushing to 1.0.2
  Move poll function to a local var, should fix bugs in IE<9 when minified with uglifyjs, due to https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/issues/161
