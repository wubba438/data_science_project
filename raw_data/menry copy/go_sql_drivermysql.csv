* packets: reset read deadline before conn check

If a MySQL connection has been configured with a short `ReadTimeout`,
each read from the TCP connection will be preceded by a
`SetReadDeadline` call, which lingers until the next `SetReadDeadline`.

This can be an issue if the connection becomes stale after staying too
long in the connection pool, because when we attempt to perform a stale
connection check, the Go runtime scheduler will return a timedout error
from the scheduler itself, without letting us get to the kernel to
perform the non-blocking read.

To fix this, reset the read deadline before we perform the connection
check.

PR #838 introduced a fix for the driver's custom Value Converter that
stopped emitting large uint64 `driver.Value`s as a string. Instead, now
_all_ uint{8,16,32,64} values passed to the driver are returned as
uint64, and `packets.c` now explicitly handles `driver.Value` instances
that are uint64.

However, the update in `packets.c` only applies when sending
`driver.Value` arguments to the server. When a connection is set up
using `InterpolateParams = true` and query interpolation happens inside
of the driver, the `(*mysqlConn) interpolateParams` does **not** handle
uint64 values (which, again, are now passed by `database/sql` because
we've updated our value converter to generate them).

Because of this, any `DB.Query` operations which have an uint argument
(regardless of its size!!) will force the driver to return
`driver.ErrSkip`, disabling client interpolation for such queries.

We can fix this by updating `interpolateParams` like we previously
updated `writeExecutePacket`."

This commit contains a potential fix to the issue reported in #657.

As a summary: when a MySQL server kills a connection on the server-side
(either because it is actively pruning connections, or because the
connection has hit the server-side timeout), the Go MySQL client does
not immediately become aware of the connection being dead.

Because of the way TCP works, the client cannot know that the connection
has received a RST packet from the server (i.e. the server-side has
closed) until it actually reads from it. This causes an unfortunate bug
wherein a MySQL idle connection is pulled from the connection pool, a
query packet is written to it without error, and then the query fails
with an ""unexpected EOF"" error when trying to read the response packet.

Since the initial write to the socket does not fail with an error, it is
generally not safe to return `driver.ErrBadConn` when the read fails,
because in theory the write could have arrived to the server and could
have been committed. Returning `ErrBadConn` could lead to duplicate
inserts on the database and data corruption because of the way the Go
SQL package performs retries.

In order to significantly reduce the circumstances where this
""unexpected EOF"" error is returned for stale connections, this commit
performs a liveness check before writing a new query.

When do we check?
-----------------

This check is not performed for all writes. Go 1.10 introduced a new
`sql/driver` interface called `driver.SessionResetter`, which calls the
`ResetSession` method on any connections _when they are returned to the
connection pool_. Since performing the liveness check during
`ResetSession` is not particularly useful (the connection can spend a
long time in the pool before it's checked out again, and become stale),
we simply mark the connection with a `reset` flag instead.

This `reset` flag is then checked from `mysqlConn.writePacket` to
perform the liveness checks. This ensures that the liveness check will
only be performed for the first query on a connection that has been
checked out of the connection pool. These are pretty much the semantics
we want: a fresh connection from the pool is more likely to be stale,
and it has not performed any previous writes that could cause data
corruption. If a connection is being consistently used by the client
(i.e. through an open transaction), we do NOT perform liveness checks.
If MySQL Server kills such active connection, we want to bubble up the
error to the user because any silent retrying can and will lead to data
corruption.

Since the `ResetSession` interface is only available in Go 1.10+, the
liveness checks will only be performed starting with that Go version.

How do we check?
----------------

To perform the actual liveness test on the connection, we use the new
`syscall.Conn` interface which is available for all `net.Conn`s since Go
1.9. The `SyscallConn` method returns a `RawConn` that lets us read
directly from the connection's file descriptor using syscalls, and
skipping the default read pipeline of the Go runtime.

When reading directly from the file descriptor using `syscall.Read`, we
pass in a 1-length buffer, as passing a 0-length buffer will always
result in a 0-length read, and the 1-length buffer will never be filled
because we're not expecting any reads from MySQL before we have written
any request packets in a fresh connection.

All sockets created in the Go runtime are set to non-blocking
(O_NONBLOCK). Consequently, we can detect a socket that has been closed
on the server-side because the `read` syscall will return a 0-length read
_and_ no error.

We assume that any other errors returned from the `read` also mean the
connection is in a bad state, except for `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK`, which is
the expected return for a healthy non-blocking socket in this circumstance.

Because of the dependency on `syscall.Conn`, liveness checks can only be
performed in Go 1.9+. This restriction however overlaps with the fact
that we only mark connections as having been reset in Go 1.10+, as
explained in the previous section."

According to the database/sql/driver documentation, ErrBadConn should only
be used when the database was not affected. The driver restarts the same
query on a different connection, then.
The mysql driver did not follow this advice, so queries were repeated if
ErrBadConn is returned but a query succeeded.

This is fixed by changing most ErrBadConn errors to ErrInvalidConn.

The only valid returns of ErrBadConn are at the beginning of a database
interaction when no data was sent to the database yet.

Those valid cases are located the following funcs before attempting to write
to the network or if 0 bytes were written:

* Begin
* BeginTx
* Exec
* ExecContext
* Prepare
* PrepareContext
* Query
* QueryContext

Commit and Rollback could arguably also be on that list, but are left out as
some engines like MyISAM are not supporting transactions.

Tests in b/packets_test.go were changed because they simulate a read not
preceded by a write to the db. This cannot happen as the client has to send
the query first."

Since 5.6.27, mysql server produces a warning if string literals cannot
be interpreted in a given character set (see Bug #20238729).
As a consequence, the driver may fail to insert []byte data into
BLOB columns when interpolateParams is true.

This commit adds ""_binary"" encoding prefix when interpolating []byte data
to avoid that warning.
