* Setting PORT to `0`, or passing `0` as the `port` option to `apostrophe-express`, now works per the TCP documentation: you get a random port number. You can access that port number as `apos.modules['apostrophe-express'].port`. Thanks to J. Garijo for this contribution.
* The ability to add a new image while selecting one for a widget has been restored. Similar scenarios while editing other joins are also fixed.
* Double-clicking the ""Edit"" button of a widget no longer causes a race condition. Thanks to Mayank Bansal for pointing out the issue and how to reproduce it.
* Undisplayed tooltips no longer take up space in a way that causes interface frustration."

* Nested areas can now be edited properly when found inside a dialog box, such as the ""Edit"" dialog box of a piece type.
* Upgraded `diff` package to continue passing `npm audit`.
* Upgraded `jQuery` from version 3.3.1 to version 3.4.1, for those who have set `jQuery: 3` as an option to `apostrophe-assets`. This addresses a minor prototype pollution bug in jQuery. Please note that if you are not using `jQuery: 3`, you are still using jQuery 1.x. If you have jQuery code that will not work with 3.x, you should take the plunge and fix it, as there are no new fixes forthcoming for any issues with jQuery 1.x. You can also use the new `lean: true` option to eliminate jQuery altogether when no user is logged in (in Apostrophe 3.x this will be the behavior all the time)."

* Bug fix: an open redirect vulnerability has been fixed. It was possible to convince Apostrophe to redirect to a third-party website by appending an escaped URL with a trailing slash added at the end. Apostrophe's trailing-slash remover would then cause a redirect to the un-escaped version of the slug part of the URL. The fix removes all multiple-slash sequences from the slug part of the URL. Thanks to Bharath for reporting this issue.
* Bug fix: attempting to save a doc with a `required` `array` field without ever opening the array editor formerly caused strange behavior. You now get a standard indication that the field is required.
* Feature: the method that supplies the choices for a dynamic `select` element may be a simple synchronous function, if desired. Formerly returning a promise (or using an async function) was mandatory.
* Feature: `apos.utils.post` will now accept a `FormData` object as the `data` prameter. In this situation JSON encoding is not used. This may be used to easily submit file uploads with Apostrophe's CSRF protection and is supported at least back to IE11."

The `apostrophe-lean-frontend` module has been deprecated and its functionality has been merged into the core. All of the functionality of the `apos.lean` object is now available on the `apos.utils` object at all times. And if you set the `lean: true` option for the `apostrophe-assets` module, **only lean JavaScript is pushed** when logged out (assets pushed with `when: 'lean'`, including the lean methods of `apos.utils`). This creates a migration path to a leaner frontend: developers can write NPM modules that rely only the lean `apos.utils` methods without worrying about whether they are present or not. Note that this is also the official frontend library for the forthcoming Apostrophe 3.x (Of course, as always, you can choose to push more code, use webpack, etc.)
* Bug fix: a regression introduced in 2.90.0 caused all uses of ""Copy Page"" to copy the home page. This is fixed.
* Bug fix: copying a page with custom fields now copies those fields properly.
* Bug fix: ""Copy Page"" now correctly copies parked page fields to the new, unparked page and then allows them to be edited for the new page.
* Bug fix: addressed browser errors that occurred when using an empty rich text toolbar. Unfortunately it is not possible to completely eliminate the ckeditor 4 toolbar when there are no tools present. This is due to a ckeditor bug."

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* `getSchemaOptions` method no longer throws inappropriate errors when the alternate form of `apos.area` or `apos.singleton` is used. Bug introduced in 2.89.0.
* The CSRF cookie is once again always reset on each request, to ensure no discrepancy between the session (and session cookie) lifespan and the CSRF cookie lifespan. This does not force sessions to exist unnecessarily, it just ensures CSRF errors do not mysteriously begin to appear in long-idle sessions, or when making cross-domain locale switches via the editing interface in apostrophe-workflow.
* Edits to raw .css files once again trigger less-middleware to recognize a change has occurred and avoid sending a stale cached file in development. When `.css` (rather than `.less`) assets are pushed inline, which is necessary to match the behavior we formerly received from clean-css and avoid crashes on CSS that the LESS parser cannot handle, we now monitor them for changes ourselves and ""touch"" the master LESS file to help the `less-middleware` module figure out that they have been changed.

* Many significant improvements to make crashes and restarts less likely.
* The most frequently used methods now sanity-check their arguments and invoke their callback, or as appropriate, if they are not valid. This replaces many full-process crashes with polite 500 errors.
* New, safer and easier alternatives to `self.route`:
  * `self.apiRoute`, which accepts a `next` function that can be passed either an error, or `(null, value)`, where `value` is an object to be sent to the browser with a `status: 'ok'` property automatically added — the convention for APIs in Apostrophe 2.x. In addition, errors reported to `next` are converted to `status` properties and/or logged gracefully, including more complete information about where the error took place for easier debugging. Most core routes have been refactored to use it. This approach extends Express 4.0's concept of error handlers with the ability to handle success as well. You can still use `res` if you need to, for instance to issue a redirect.
  * `self.renderRoute`, which accepts a `next` function that can be passed either an error that will be mapped to an appropriate HTTP status code, or `(null, { template: 'templateName', data: { ... props for the template ... })`. The named template is rendered with `self.render`, and any exceptions thrown are caught properly and logged as errors without a process crash — unlike what frequently happened before in such routes.
  * `self.htmlRoute`, similar to renderRoute but it does not render the markup for you; instead you pass markup as the second argument to `next()`. Useful if you are rendering by some means other than `self.render`.
* For template errors, a great deal of redundant error logging has been removed.
* Introduced `apos.utils.warnDevOnce`, refactored some existing warnings to use it, and added a call for CSRF errors to help developers understand what these mean.
* New trace feature to help debug crashes in Apostrophe's startup process. Try: `APOS_TRACE_STARTUP=1 node app`

By default, Apostrophe creates a session for every site visitor, even an anonymous visitor, to provide full CSRF protection. You may now optionally disable this for anonymous visitors:

```javascript
modules: {
  'apostrophe-express': {
    csrf: {
      disableAnonSession: true
    }
  }
}
```

When you do this, anonymous visitors receive only basic CSRF protection based on a known header value and the fact that the Same Origin Policy does not allow requests to be made by JavaScript unless the page is on the proper site.

For performance reasons the largest sites will likely find this to be a valuable option.

* `apos.global.findGlobal` now officially supports returning a promise. This was an unofficial side effect in earlier releases that ceased to work in recent releases.

* Updated the version of `moment` that ships on the front end to the latest minor release.

* Eliminated unnecessary arrangeFields warnings. `apostrophe-groups` is set up properly, the `trash` field no longer generates warnings when workflow is active, and reverse joins no longer generate warnings as they have no editing UI.

* `null` values were able to crash the schema converters for strings, integers and floats when those fields were `required`. This has been fixed."

If your database starts out in a dev environment and is later moved to a production environment, or you use stagecoach or a similar deployment tool that guarantees migrations are run on all code deployments (and you should definitely do that), then this will not be an issue.
* Building on the support for namespaced npm modules as apostrophe modules added in 2.86.0, the `testModule: true` flag used to test apostrophe in the context of an npm module like `apostrophe-workflow` can now be used in a namespaced npm module. Thanks to Aurélien Wolz for this contribution.

Thanks to Michelin for making much of this work possible through [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support)."

One exception: we still do a query for distinct content types in the db for stability and reliability reasons.

* If a JPEG file has EXIF data such as the description, credit, etc. this information is
now copied into new properties of the attachment field and made available automatically
on corresponding new schema properties of `apostrophe-images` pieces.
* `req.data.global` now becomes available even before its joins and area loaders are
executed, as `req.aposGlobalCore`. This allows modules such as `apostrophe-pieces-orderings-bundle` to avoid recursive scenarios and performance problems.
* Sortable columns in the manage view can now indicate whether the first click sorts forwards
or backwards, simply by specifying the sort direction in the usual MongoDB way with `1` or
`-1`.
* Sortable columns can now be toggled from ""no sort"" to ""forward"" to ""backward"" and back to ""no sort"" again, and the hover state indicates all of these ""next"" states.
* The `limitByAll` and `limitByTag` options of the `apostrophe-pieces-widgets` module now correctly remove these fields from the `showFields` of the select element that chooses how the widget will select content to display.
* To select many consecutive pieces or pages quickly in the ""Manage Pieces"" and ""Reorganize Pages"" views, hold down the shift button while clicking a second piece. All pieces between the two pieces selected so far will be chosen.

* The conflict resolution mechanism for simultaneous edits has been improved. Previously, Apostrophe tracked how long it had been since the ""last edit"" by the previous person. But if the browser window closed without sending an ""unlock"" message, that ""last edit"" might be a very long time ago. This led to nuisance confirmation prompts and a tendency to ignore their message.

Beginning with this release, the browser instead actively refreshes the lock periodically. And if the browser does not do so for 5 minutes, the lock is automatically discarded.

This greatly reduces the chance that you will see a ""someone else is editing that document"" message when this is not actually the case.

However, do note that you will no longer see an indication of the ""last edit"" time. This is because this time was never really meaningful for the ""Edit Piece"" dialog box, and often misleading for on-page editing as well. Instead, you may assume that the other person is still at the very least on the page in question if you see this message at all.

* Although it was released separately as part of the `launder` module, and an `npm update` should fetch it for you automatically, it should be mentioned that `launder` version 1.1.1 has been released and prevents crashes if the `value` of some of your select element choices is null or undefined. Such choices do not work and cannot be selected reliably (only strings and numbers are supported, including the empty string), but since versions prior to 1.1.0 did not crash on such choices, we have patched 1.1.1 to also tolerate their presence.

Thanks to our [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support) clients for making these enhancements possible.

* The case-insensitive sort for filter choices no longer crashes if a choice cannot be converted to a string. Thanks to Fawzi Fakhro."

* A recently introduced change broke the filtering that prevented users from selecting too-small images when `minSize` is in effect. This has been corrected. Note that site visitors never actually saw too-small images because filtering did take effect later in the process.
* Numbers (in addition to strings) are now permissible choices for select elements. If the choice selected is a number, a number will be stored in the field. Most of this fix is in the `launder` module but there is a small fix in apostrophe core as well.
* If a doc is in the trash already, the edit dialog box should have a ""Rescue"" button rather than a ""Trash"" button on the ""More"" dropdown menu.
* `boolean` fields can now be made `mandatory`. If a boolean field is mandatory, the form will not validate unless the user selects ""Yes."" This is useful for simple ""terms and conditions"" forms. You must specify a message to be shown to the user if they do not select ""Yes,"" like this:

```
{
  name: 'toc',
  label: 'Accept the Terms and Conditions',
  type: 'boolean',
  // Displayed if you try to save without picking Yes
  mandatory: 'You must accept the Terms and Conditions to continue.',
  // Always displayed
  help: 'I have read and accept the Terms and Conditions.'
}
```

Although the documentation formerly claimed that `required: true` would have this effect for boolean fields, it was pointed out that this functionality did not work, and as a result far too many sites already use `required: true` for booleans in a way that would break if we implemented the original documented behavior. Therefore we are changing the documentation to match this new implementation that maintains backwards compatibility."

* You can now set permissions for many pieces at once via the new ""set permissions for...""
batch operation in the ""manage pieces"" dialog box. Batch operations are accessible via a
dropdown at the bottom of the dialog box after you check the boxes to select various pieces.
Note that if you check the box to select all the pieces on this page, you will be asked
if you want to select *all* pieces. So it is possible to set the permissions of all of the
pieces at once.

Note that **permissions have no effect on file attachment URLs unless you use
the optional [apostrophe-secure-attachments](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-secure-attachments) module.** Once you add that module, the new batch operation becomes a powerful
way to lock down all of your PDFs at once.

* The ""Select Everything"" checkbox for pieces, which becomes accessible after you ""Select All""
pieces on the current page, now operates much faster on large databases and does not block
the main thread of browser execution for an extended time."

* Most migrations were failing when run in a non-interactive session.
This was due to a stray piece of code that tried to interact with the
progress meter when it was not available. This has been fixed. This
was the underlying major issue in version 2.77.0.
* The recent migration to set the `docIds` and `trashDocIds` properties of
attachments correctly, allowing them to become inaccessible at the
proper time, now runs and completes correctly, at the end of which
all attachment permissions are properly restored. This resolves the issue
that began with version 2.77.0.
* The migration was also updated to avoid any chance of needlessly
disabling permissions on a temporary basis during the migration run.
* **If you temporarily lost access to your media due to running migrations
with 2.77.0, which was available for a few hours today, you can restore access**
with the following command line task:

```
node app apostrophe-attachments:recompute-all-doc-references
```

**If you manually set your permissions globally as a workaround**, you should run
this task to reset them appropriately:

```
node app apostrophe-attachments:reset-uploadfs-permissions
```

Although there is no reason to expect a recurrence of this issue, these
command line tasks will continue to be available going forward, just in case.

Our regression tests are being updated to prevent a recurrence by
noninteractively invoking `apostrophe-migrations:migrate`
and checking for a clean exit code."

* **The home page now works correctly when it is a pieces-page** powered by
`apostrophe-pieces-pages`. Specifically, the URLs of pieces are generated
correctly in this situation. This allows the home page to be a blog page,
for example. Regression tests have been added to ensure this does
not break in the future.

* **Attachments (files) now become inaccessible properly** when the
last file or image piece that directly contains them moves to the trash.
Formerly, attachments were incorrectly marked as ""part of"" pages that
merely loaded them as part of a join or similar relationship. **A migration
has been added** to correctly reset the `docIds` and `trashDocIds` arrays
of all attachments on a one-time basis after which they will be tracked
properly going forward.

* **Migrations now have a progress display when iterating over all
documents.** This progress display automatically goes away if the
migrations task is not running with access to a TTY (for instance,
it is running in a deployment pipeline). You may note that not all
migrations use this feature; generally the most time-consuming will however.

* **You can now specify a projection for a reverse join without the need to explicitly include the `idsField`, or even know what it is.** This was one of several reasons why developers often gave up on projections for reverse joins, or went back to the old approach of specifying `idsField` rather than using `reverseOf`.

Here is an example from the [apostrophe-samples](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-samples) project:

```javascript
// Forward join: in schema of products
{
  name: '_specialists',
  type: 'joinByArray',
  withType: 'specialist',
  label: 'Specialists',
  help: 'The right people to ask about this product.'
}
```

```javascript
// Reverse join: in schema of specialists
{
  name: '_products',
  type: 'joinByArrayReverse',
  withType: 'product',
  reverseOf: '_specialists',
  projection: {
    _url: 1,
    title: 1
  }
}
```

> Note that we can also project `_url: 1` to get all the fields necessary
to populate `_url` when the product is fetched, even though it is not
a real property in the database.

* Unnecessary schema validation errors are no longer thrown when using
`joinByOneReverse` with `reverseOf`.

* Schema fields named `format` are now allowed for pieces. There was a
conflict with the UI code and backend routes of the ""Manage Pieces"" dialog box.

* ""Drag and drop"" now works properly for widgets that have just been
added to the page. There is no need to refresh the page first."

* Email schema field type added. Thanks to Andrea Di Mario.
* Developer warnings for bad `showFields` configuration now apply to all field types that support `showFields`.
* Schemas are now validated for nested `array` and `object` schemas, giving developers more information to help them fix their code.
* The `poll-notifications` API now runs as middleware that is scheduled as early as `req.user` becomes available, avoiding the overhead of loading `req.data.global` in this frequently polled API.
* The `poll-notifications` API does not crash if the `apos` object has been destroyed. This is not an issue for typical sites. However, this fix removes scary error messages displayed by the very useful [apostrophe-monitor](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-monitor) module, which is similar to `nodemon` but specialized to Apostrophe for much faster restarts.
* Although technically released in the `moog-require` module, not here, a recent fix in that module bears mentioning because it prevents both `apostrophe-monitor` and `apostrophe-multisite` from misbehaving when the options objects of modules are modified. Specifically, the modifications are now reliably distinct for each `apos` object.
*
* The logic that removes certain typically unwanted buttons from CKEditor is now conditional and does not remove them when they are explicitly requested in the toolbar. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* Placeholder markup when a pieces widget is empty. Although not often used directly, this template is often copied as a starting point.
* An open ""add widget"" area menu now appears above any hovered widget controls rather than being lost behind them.
* `showFields` support for fields of type `checkboxes` has been restored.
* The ""recursion warning"" that appears when the same doc is loaded more than 5 times in a single request can now be suppressed on a per-request basis by setting `req.suppressAreaLoaderRecursionWarnings` to `true`. However the runaway loading process is still prevented. This is mainly of use for workflow API routes that examine many documents but are OK with stopping in this situation without generating extra log messages."

* The server side notification persistence feature introduced in version 2.74.0 led to an intermittent bug: the ""long polling"" used to deliver notifications quickly interacted badly with the ""resave"" behavior of Express sessions, resulting in frequent loss of other session changes, such as draft/live mode switching. This has been fixed. Since we cannot disable `resave` with the standard session store in Apostrophe 2.x, an `apos.utils.readOnlySession(req)` method was added, and the route that ""long polls"" for new notifications now uses it to disable any modification to the session for the duration of the request.
* `limitByAll`, `limitByTag` and `limitById` options for `apostrophe-pieces-widgets`. When set the user is not prompted to choose their own maximum.
* Fixed conditions in which editing the first or last name of a new `apostrophe-user` did not affect their `slug` in the expected way.
* Fixed bug: if trashInSchema is in effect, subpages should not have their trash status overridden to match the new parent when their ancestor is moved. This is important when using ""Reorganize"" with workflow. Additional improvements to better integrate ""Reorganize"" ointo the workflow module are separately forthcoming.
* Fixed a bug that prevented `view` permissions from being given out programmatically in certain edge cases.
* The `slug` cursor filter now has a `launder` method, for use when marking it safe for `req.query`. Thanks to Anthony Tarlao.

Thanks to our customers at Michelin and NPM for making much of the above work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support)."

* Server-side code may now call `apos.notify(req, 'This is a message')` to send a message to the logged-in user associated with `req`. That message will pop up on the browser and will remain visible until they dismiss it. If the user is not logged in right now, they will see it when they do log in.

You may use `%s` to interpolate additional string arguments, and you may pass an `options` object with `dismiss: true` for a self-dismissing notification. You may also set the `type` option to `error`, `warn` or `success` for different visual treatments. For example:

```
apos.notify(req, 'Sorry, you did not win a shiny new %s!', req.piece.title, { type: 'error' });
```

The API is identical to that for `apos.notify` on the browser side, except that `req` must be passed as the first argument. Also the method returns a promise, which resolves when the notification has reached the database. You may also optionally pass a final callback for the same purpose. This is useful when sending a notification just before a task exits the process. The rest of the time you won't need to worry about it.

* In `2.73.0`, an optional second argument, `locale`, was added to the `date` Nunjucks filter. As it turns out this was done in a way that could have a knock-on effect on later uses of `date` that did not specify a locale. This has been fixed and unit tests have been added. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.

* The values of fields hidden via `showFields` are now saved to the database, as long as they contain no errors. This allows you to return to an old setting and discover all of its sub-settings intact.

* By default, Apostrophe deletes old asset bundles from uploadfs (S3, azure, etc.) five minutes after the launch of the site. The assumption is that the deployment of static assets has reached all peer servers and there is no need to keep old assets around. The `uploadfsBundleCleanup` option to `apostrophe-assets` may now be set explicitly to `false` to prevent this, as may be needed if asset bundles are shared between sub-deployments that are made at greatly varying times.

* When `apostrophe-workflow` is present, ""Batch Commit"" and other inappropriate options are no longer offered for groups, which are not subject to workflow.

This method returns a promise; when that promise resolves the password reset email has been successfully handed off for delivery. Note that the promise will be rejected if the user object has no `email` property."

* The ""apply to subpages"" feature for page permissions has been greatly simplified and made easier to understand. There is now just one shared ""copy these permissions to subpages now?"" dropdown, which applies to ALL current permissions for the current page: ""who can view this page,"" ""these users can view,"" ""these groups can edit,"" etc.

As the help text now properly explains, if you pick ""yes"" and save page settings as usual, the permissions of all subpages are updated to match **on a one-time basis.** After that, you can edit them normally for the subpages. This is an action that takes place at ""save"" time, it is not a setting that is remembered.

This is good for laying down a baseline and then making fine-tuned adjustments per page, which is typical practice.

Previously this choice appeared in several places, including as a highly confusing and visually cluttered dropdown within the list of permissions per user and group. While theoretically this allowed for propagating fine-tuned adjustments to subpages one at a time, in practice users did not understand it, including many enterprise customers who invest significant time in Apostrophe. Therefore a simpler solution is of greater overall value.

* Regression fix: support for in-context, on-page editing of areas in array fields has been restored.

* Attempts to save a field of type `object` with a missing `required` field now behave sensibly, you no longer see a spinner forever on a grayed-out page. Note that the use of `required` for the object itself has no meaning because there is always an object; you should make its fields required, or not, as you see fit.

* ""Move"" and ""Trash"" operations on widgets now emit the Apostrophe events `widgetMoved` and `widgetTrashed`. The widget's container div is emitted as the argument to the event."

* Moving a page beneath a parent that happens to be considered ""not trash"" should not automatically cause the child to be considered ""not trash"" when workflow is in effect, or when the `trashInSchema` flag has been opted into for `apostrophe-docs`. In these cases the trash flag is just another schema property. This bug led to pages inadvertently becoming live across all locales when moved in the page tree.
* The server-side video schema field converter no longer crashes the process if given a `null` property, and correctly flags the field as in error if it is `required` and not present.
* Any missing values for join relationships relating to permissions are now handled in a proper migration in apostrophe core, rather than a hack in apostrophe-workflow that adds significant startup time in certain situations.
* Migration completion is now logged.

not be called.

This came up as an issue for me after the recent merging of #1638,

wrapped in an <a> element. Clicking the .apos-buttons would trigger
a click on the link as well, and so the browser would navigate away

Apostrophe now allows direct import of unparsed CSS files via import flags of LESS. The best use of this option is to push a CSS file created by a SASS compiler or other LESS alternative.

To push a CSS asset *without* compiling it as LESS, you may write:

```
self.pushAsset('stylesheet', {
  name: 'bundle',
  import: {
    inline: true
  }
});
```

Or, if you are pushing assets via the `stylesheets` option of the `apostrophe-assets` module, you may write:

```
'apostrophe-assets': {
  stylesheets: [
    {
      name: 'bundle',
      import: {
        inline: true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The extension of the file may be either `.css` or `.less`; either way it is imported with no LESS compilation. Apostrophe will still modify URLs to accommodate the global `prefix` option, if present."

* Promisified all of the apis for migrations, including the option of iterators that return promises, and implemented migrations for old piece and page slugs that have not been deduplicated and thus can block new pages or pieces from taking a slug even though we have logic for this for new pages and pieces.
* In-context editing support for areas and singletons that are schema fields of arrays. Leaves other, noncontextual data alone. Creating and editing entire array items contextually is outside the scope of this change; use an area rather than an array for that. Directly nested arrays are not supported, but you may use an area in an array in a widget in an array, etc.
* `.jpeg` files were slipping through with that extension. All new uploads will be correctly converted to `.jpg` and go through the proper sizing process.
* The `enableShowFields` option was missing some of its logic for fields of type `checkboxes`. Thanks to Anthony Tarlao.
* A `_title` property is now included in attachments returned by `apos.images.all` and `apos.images.first`.
* When apostrophe cannot fix a unique key error, it is helpful to be able to see the last error, as well as the original one. This helps you figure it out if both a unique slug error and an unrelated unique key error are part of the puzzle. We still throw the original error, but we also attach the last error as a property of it, so you can see both.
* The `apos.areas.fromPlaintext` method now takes an `options` parameter. You may set the `el` property to an element name, in which case the markup is wrapped in that HTML element. `options` may be omitted."

* Pages can now be locked down with the `allowedHomepageTypes` and `allowedSubpageTypes` options, like this:

```javascript
// Only one type allowed for the home page
allowedHomepageTypes: [ 'home' ],

allowedSubpageTypes: {
  // Two subpage types allowed for the home page
  'home': [ 'default', 'apostrophe-blog-page' ],
  // No subpages for the blog page (""show pages"" don't count)
  'apostrophe-blog-page': [],
  // default page type can only have another default page as a subpage
  'default': [ 'default' ]
}
```

These options make it easy to prevent users from creating unintended scenarios, like nesting pages too deeply for your navigation design.

* Pages now support batch operations, just like pieces do. The initial set includes trash, rescue, publish, unpublish, tag and untag. You can only rescue pages in this way if you are using the `trashInSchema` option of the docs module, which is always the case with `apostrophe-workflow`. With the conventional trash can, it is unclear what should happen because you have not indicated where you want each page to be restored. New batch operations for pages can be added in the same way that they are added for pieces.

* Important performance fix needed for those using the `apostrophe-pieces-orderings-bundle` module to create custom sort orders for pieces. Without this fix it is also possible to get a loader error and stop fetching content prematurely.

* The ""revert"" button for versions is now labeled ""Revert to"" to emphasize that it reverts to what you had at the end of that operation, not its beginning. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund."

""Revert"" is somewhat ambigous compared to ""Revert to"" - does it mean
""undo this change"" or ""go back to this change""? Well it does mean the
latter, and labelling it ""Revert to"" clarifies that.

Also, I took the chance to run some more labels in there through the
i18n __ function.

Lastly, I added some additional pixels to the subtracted width of
.apos-changes-meta, because in viewports wider than 1450px,
.apos-button--major receives an increase in font-weight. This adds 1
additional pixel to the width of ""Revert to"" now that we have more
characters in there, so we need to counteract that."

This property is only used to preserve the previous versions of widgets that the user lacks permission to edit due to schema field permissions.

* **Important fix for MongoDB replica sets:** previously we used the `autoReconnect` option of the MongoDB driver by default. From now on, we use it only if the MongoDB URI does not refer to a replica set. The use of `autoReconnect` is [inappropriate with a replica set](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues/1508) because it will keep trying to connect to the node that went down. Leaving this option out results in automatic use of nodes that are up. Also see the [apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver) module for a way to use the newer `mongodb+srv` URIs. Thanks to Matt Broadstone of MongoDB for his advice.

* An `apostrophe-file` now has a default URL. The default `_url` property of an `apostrophe-file` piece is simply the URL of the file itself. This allows `apostrophe-file` to be included in your configuration for [apostrophe-permalinks](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-permalinks); picking a PDF in this way generates a direct link to the PDF, which is what the user expects. Note that if the developer elects to set up an `apostrophe-files-pages` module that extends `apostrophe-pieces-pages`, that will still take precedence, so there is no bc break.

* Clicking directly from one rich text widget into another did not work properly; the toolbar did not appear in this situation. This bug has been fixed. The bug only occurred when clicking in a second rich text widget without any intervening clicks outside of all rich text widgets."

* Apostrophe's ""search suggestions"" feature for `notFound.html` templates is now fully baked. It only takes two steps:

1. Include an element like this in your `notFound.html` template:

```
<div data-apos-notfound-search-results></div>
```

2. Set the `suggestions` option to `true` for the `apostrophe-search` module.

With `suggestions: true`, this feature no longer requires that you have a `/search` page, it uses a dedicated route. See the documentation of the `apostrophe-search` module for more information.

* The `showFields` option is now available for checkboxes. The syntax is as follows:

```
{
  ""name"": ""awesomeBoolean"",
  ""label"": ""Awesome Boolean"",
  ""type"": ""boolean"",
  ""choices"": [
    {

    }
  ]
}
```

Thanks to falkodev.

* A useful error message appears if you try to use a `mongodb+srv` URL. These are meant for newer versions of the MongoDB driver. You **can** use them, but you must install the [apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver](https://npmjs.com/package/apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver) module first. The error message now explains this, addressing a common question on stackoverflow.
* Basic styles added for the most common rich text markup tags when within the bounds of an Apostrophe modal. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Fixed UI overlap issue when joining with `apostrophe-page`.
* `apos.images.all`, `apos.images.first`, etc. now include `_description`, `_credit` and `_creditUrl` when they can be inferred from an `apostrophe-image` containing the attachment.
* `apos.images.srcset` helper improved. It is now smart enough to limit the image sizes it offers based on what it knows about the size of the original. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* Fixes to CSS asset URL generation to pass validation.
* Performance: eliminated use of `$or` MongoDB queries with regard to pages in the trash. MongoDB tests demonstrate that `$ne: true` is faster than `$or` for our purposes."

* “Promise events” have arrived. This is a major feature. Promise events will completely
replace `callAll` in Apostrophe 3.x. For 2.x, all existing invocations of `callAll` in the
core Apostrophe module now also emit a promise event. For instance, when the `docBeforeInsert`
callAll method is invoked, Apostrophe also emits the `beforeInsert` promise event on the
apostrophe-docs` module.

Other modules may listen for this event by writing code like this:

```javascript
`self.on('apostrophe-docs:beforeInsert', 'chooseASpecialist', function(req, doc, options) {
  // Modify `doc` here. You may return a promise, and it will resolve before
  // any more handlers run. Then the doc is inserted
});
```

The above code adds a new `chooseASpecialist` method to your module. This way, the method can be overridden by assigning a new function to `self.chooseASpecialist` in a module that
extends it, or its behavior can be extended in the usual way following the `super` pattern.

But, since it does not have the same name as
the event (attempting to register a method of the same name will throw an error), it is unlikely
that parent class modules and subclass modules will have unintentional conflicts.

See the [original github issue](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues/1415) for a more
complete description of the feature and the reasoning behind it.

**Your existing callAll methods will still work.** But, we recommend you start migrating to be
ready to move to 3.x in the future... and because returning promises is just a heck of
a lot nicer. You will have fewer problems.

* Optional SVG support for `apostrophe-images`. To enable it, set the `svgImages` option to
`true` when configuring the `apostrophe-images` module. SVG files can be uploaded just like
other image types. Manual cropping is not available. However, since most SVG files play very well
with backgrounds, the SVG file is displayed in its entirety without distortion at the largest size
that fits within the aspect ratio of the widget in question, if any (`background-size: contain`
is used). if you have overridden `widget.html` for `apostrophe-images-widgets`, you will want
to refer to the latest version of `widgetBase.html` for the technique we used here to ensure
SVG files do not break the slideshow’s overall height.
* New `apos.templates.prepend` and `apos.templates.append` methods. Call
`apos.templates.prepend('head', function(req) { ... })` to register a function to be called just after
the head tag is opened each time a page is rendered. The output of your function is inserted into
the markup. The standard named locations are `head`, `body`, `contextMenu` and `main`. This is
convenient when writing modules that add new features to Apostrophe. For project level work also see the
named Nunjucks blocks already provided in `outerLayoutBase.html`.
* `apos.singleton` now accepts an `areaOptions` option, which can receive any option that can be
passed to `apos.area`. Thanks to Manoj Krishnan.
* Apostrophe’s “projector” jQuery plugin now respects the `outerHeight` of the tallest slideshow item,
not just the inner height.
* `apos.area` now accepts an `addLabel` option for each widget type in the area. Thanks to
Fredrik Ekelund.
* UI improvements to versioning. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Button to revert to the current version has been replaced with a label indicating it is current,
since reverting to the current version has no effect.
* “Page settings” can now be accessed for any page in the trash via “reorganize.” When
working with `apostrophe-workflow`, this is
often required to commit the fact that a page is in the trash.
* The `uploadfs` module now has a `prefix` option. If present, the prefix is prepended to all uploadfs paths before they reach the storage layer, and is also prepended to URLs. In practice, this means that a single S3 bucket can be used to host multiple sites without all of the uploaded media jumbling together in `/attachments`. The `apostrophe-multisite` module now leverages this."

* Introduced a `findWithProjection()` method that is added to all MongoDB collection objects. All Apostrophe core modules are migrating towards using this method rather than `find()` when working **directly with MongoDB collections**. If you are using the standard MongoDB 2.x driver that is included with Apostrophe, this just calls regular `find()`. When using the forthcoming `apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver` module to replace that with a newer driver that supports the full features of MongoDB 3.6, 4.0 and beyond, this method will provide backwards compatibility by accepting a projection as the second argument like `find()` did until the 3.x driver was released. Developers wishing to be compatible with both drivers will want to start using this method. Again, this **only concerns you if you are querying MongoDB directly and passing a projection to find() as the second argument**. And if you don't care about using the 3.x driver, you **do not have to change anything**.
* Various UX improvements and bug fixes to the page versions dialog box. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* The widget wrapper is updated on the fly with new classes if they change due to edits. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* When configuring a `date` field, you may pass a `pikadayOptions` property. This object is passed on to the `pikaday` library. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* The `counts: true` option for `piecesFilters` now works properly with joins."

This seems to previously have been sort of the intention, but this change
makes it so that developers can control the default style of the CKEDITOR
instance properly. However, this implementation is somewhat naive in that
it always picks the first style if there are styles that have been defined.

CKEDITOR will always provide a <p> default (ie. if I declare an <h2> as the
default style, start the CKEDITOR instance and then immediately press Enter,
I'm back in a <p> tag instead of <h2>). But this change is breaking in the
sense that previously, developers could have provided styles only for the text
elements that weren't the regular <p> tags, but still have learned to expect
that to be the default when adding a new apostrophe-rich-text-widget.

On the other hand, this change will only apply to apostrophe-rich-text-widgets
when they are added to the page (or technically when they initialize and have
no content at all). That means the default behavior changes, but only for
new widgets that are added to the page.

Perhaps the sensible way forward is still to let developers explicitly mark
a style as the default, what do you think?"

* Fix background color on notification on uploads when file extension is not accepted. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* If you can't move a widget out of an area, you can no longer move widgets into that area either (movable: false is fully enforced). Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.

* New ""secrets"" feature in `apostrophe-users` makes it easy to hash other ""secrets"" similar in spirit to passwords.
* This feature is now used for password reset tokens, making them more secure.
* Additional joins can now be added to the schema of a widget that extends `apostrophe-pieces-widgets`.
* Brute force password attacks against an Apostrophe server are now more difficult. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Tolerant sanitization of array items while they are still in the editor. This avoids confusion caused by `required` fields in the array editor.
* Error messages now behave sensibly when multiple label elements appear in a field. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Fix background color on notification on uploads when file extension is not accepted. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* If you can't move a widget out of an area, you can no longer move widgets into that area either (movable: false is fully enforced). Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* New browser-side events are emitted during the attachment upload process, and the built-in facility that delays the saving of a form until attachment uploads are complete has been fixed. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Fixes to the active state display of array items. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) expanded with lots of new information about practical ways to contribute to Apostrophe.

* The new `apos.locks.withLock(lockName, fn)` method can be used to execute a function while the process has the named lock. This ensures that other processes cannot run that function simultaneously. You may optionally pass a callback, otherwise a promise is returned. Similarly `fn` may take a callback, or no arguments at all, in which case it is expected to return a promise.
* Cleanup: don't call `server.close` unless we've succeeded in listening for connections."

`required`, but blank because they were hidden by `showFields`.
This is of course permitted, `required` applies only if the field
is active according to `showFields` or not addressed by any
`showFields` possibilities at all. Comprehensive unit testing was
added for this issue to prevent a recurrence.
* Version 2.60.1 also introduced a more subtle issue: if constraints
like `required` or `min`, or general improvements to validation such
as NaN detection for integers and floats, were added to a widget schema later
after content already existed then it became impossible to open a widget
editor and correct the issues. Validation tolerance was added for this
situation.
* When a user edits an area ""in context"" on the page, the server now
reports errors using a path that can be used to identify the widget
responsible and open its editing dialog box. A more relevant notification
is also displayed. This remains a secondary mechanism. Server-side
validation is mostly about preventing intentional abuse. Browser-side
validation is still the best way to provide feedback during data entry."

* Fields of type `checkboxes` now play nicely with the `live/draft` toggle of `apostrophe-workflow`.
* Improved validation of integers and floats. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* The ""Global"" dialog box now follows the same pattern as that for other piece types, which means that the workflow dropdown menu is available if workflow is present.
* Options may be passed to the `express.static` middleware that serves the `public` folder, via the `static` option of the `apostrophe-express` module. Thanks to Leonhard Melzer.
* `apostrophe` now depends on `bluebird` properly and there are no lingering references to the wrong version fo `lodash`. Formerly we got away with this because some of our dependencies did depend on these, and npm flattens dependencies. Thanks to Leonhard Melzer.
* The new `eslint-config-punkave` ruleset is in place, and includes a check for ""unofficial dependencies"" in `require` calls that could go away suddenly.
* `fieldClasses` and `fieldAttributes` may be set on form fields themselves, similar to the existing `classes` and `attributes` properties that are applied to the `fieldset`. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* The ""Pages"" admin UI now includes a ""New Page"" button, in addition to the usual ""reorganize"" functionality. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Fixed a crash when an `apostrophe-pieces-widget` is configured to always show all pieces via `by: 'all'`. Thanks to Aurélien Wolz.
* General UI styling improvements and fixes."

* New feature: you can now display counts for each tag, joined item, etc. when using the `piecesFilters` option of `apostrophe-pieces-pages`. Just add `counts: true` to the configuration for that filter. The count is then available in a `.count` property for each value in the array. See [creating filter UI with apostrophe-pieces-pages](https://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/intermediate/cursors.html#creating-filter-u-i-with-code-apostrophe-pieces-pages-code) for more information.
* New feature: command line tasks such as `apostrophe-blog:generate` may now be run programmatically, for example: `apos.tasks.invoke('apostrophe-blog:generate', { total: 50 })`. A promise is returned if a callback is not passed. Note that not all tasks are written to behave politely and invoke their callback normally, however most do. This feature is most useful when writing tasks that logically should incorporate other tasks.
* Many UX and UI improvements that make the experience more pleasant in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Thanks to Carsten, Marco Arnone and the prolific Lars Houmark for their contributions. This was an excellent week for Apostrophe PRs.
* The full set of controls for joined items are again available in the chooser, as well as in the browse modal.
* The automatic opening of the admin bar menu on page load can now be configured with the `openOnLoad`, `openOnHomepageLoad`, and `closeDelay` options.
* `autocomplete=""off""` for date fields prevents chrome autocomplete suggestions from wrecking calendar UI.
* Always remove .apos-global-busy on unlock, even if the transition event never fires. Yes, that is sadly a thing. Prevents the UI from becoming unusable in rare situations (less rare inside functional tests).
* Use `one` to reduce the overhead of .apos-global-busy's transition event handler. We could do more here to reduce overhead, i.e. unhooking it entirely.
* Much-improved validation of `min`, `max` and `required` for strings, integers and floats on both the server and the browser side. Thanks to Lars Houmark."

This PR should fix re-cropping when `options.minSize` is set for the image.

I was reading the code and got somewhat reluctant to attempt a fix due to inline comments, but tried to enable `autoCrop: true;` just to see what happened. Didn't work. I then remembered my annoying #1392 which I had also noticed myself at an earlier point. The missing padding can be annoying when you have large images.

So then **magic** (maybe) happened. I went on to add a 20px padding on the `apos-mode-body` for the image crop editor and just suddenly the image crop started loading at the correct position. Well, at least most of the times. I noticed one time where I may have gotten a wrong position, but I was also opening and cloing the console.

Overall I think this is an improvement to the current situation. Even if the crop is not positioned at the right position when starting a re-crop, it will still have the correct ratio if `options.aspectRatio` is in use. Before this PR it would just load a blank image on re-crop, which meant you would have to start the process over completely.

Padding is set to `@apos-padding-2` which I think is plenty of space to grab the from the corners."

Problem #1:

Some browsers (among them Safari) fails to find the scroll position from html / body using jQuery. This is potentially related to the site having `overflow-x: hidden;` on the `html`tag.

This PR strengthens the browser lookup for the scroll position in all browsers (that I was able to test).

Problem #2:
Additionally jQuery fails to find the `offset.top` of the hidden ""load more"" button, due the button being `display: none;` in CSS/LESS. According to the jQuery documentation an element being styled with `display: none;` is excluded from the rendering tree and thus has a position that is undefined. This has been changed to `display:block;` and `visibility:hidden` This can affect the invisible space on existing sites below the AJAX content, but there's no other way and site devs can work around this by decreasing the height of the element and/or its parent. The button and it's parent(s) is removed after all content has been added to the page (nothing changed here).

Additional improvements:

* The on scroll event was always attached, even on pages which did not have any AJAX features. This PR does a check for the `data-apos-ajax-infinite-scroll` and only attaches the event watcher in case there is such an element in the DOM.

* The aforementioned scroll event watcher was firing on every scroll and this can lead to significant slugginess on scroll, especially on devices with less power, such as mobile. I have wrapped the event in a lodash throttle function which ensures a scroll event is only sent every 200ms. This should be plenty, as the code operates with a decent offset (500px default). In my testing I did not notice any delays in fetching data."

* Fixed nested widget editing for existing widgets whose modal dialog boxes have been accessed (#1428).
* A clear warning message with instructions has been added for those who are seeing ""unblessed"" messages due to widget schemas and in-template `apos.area` calls that do not match (#1429). The easiest way to avoid this is to just mark the area `contextual: true` in your widget schema so it is edited *only* on the page. But if you really want to do both, the widget options must match.
* The mechanism that automatically makes slugs, paths and other keys unique now gives up eventually and reports the original duplicate key error. This makes it easier to debug your code if you are violating your own custom indexes that feature unique keys. It is possible to make the deduplicator aware of your own own properties that need to be made more unique on inserts if you wish, by implementing a `docFixUniqueError` method. *Please note:* this change is not a regression. Code that formerly never completed its task in this situation will simply report an error promptly rather than retrying inserts forever while degrading your database performance.
* A new profiling API has been added: the `apos.utils.profile` method. This method can be called to report how long code takes to run for later analysis. It does nothing in the default implementation; modules like our forthcoming profiler override it to give feedback on the speed of your code."

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Polymorphic joins have arrived! You may now create joins like this:

```javascript
{
  name: '_items',
  type: 'joinByArray',
  withType: [ 'apostrophe-blog', 'product', 'apostrophe-page' ]
}
```

When you join with more than one type, Apostrophe presents a chooser that allows you to pick between tabs for each type. Note that `apostrophe-page` can be included, so you can pick a mix of pages and pieces for the same join.

This feature is useful for creating navigation that may point to a variety of document types, without the need for an array of items with several different joins and a `select` element to choose between them.

Polymorphic joins work for both `joinByOne` and `joinByArray`. Currently they are **not** available for `joinByOneReverse`, `joinByArrayReverse`, or pieces filters. Their primary use case is creating navigation widgets.

* `apos.images.srcset` helper function added. You can use this function to generate a `srcset` attribute for responsive display of an image. Just pass an attachment to the helper:

`<img {{ apos.images.srcset(apos.images.first(data.piece.thumbnail)) }} />`

A `src` attribute for backwards compatibility is always advisable too.

Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund for this contribution.

* Fast forms for big schemas are back! The issue with tags has been resolved.

* A single MongoDB connection may be reused by several `apos` objects for separate sites, a feature which is exploited by the [apostrophe-multisite](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-multisite) module. Note that this only reuses the connection, it does not share a single MongoDB database. It *does* allow you to keep potentially hundreds of sites on a single MongoDB server or replica set, as the overhead of multiple logical ""databases"" is small in MongoDB's modern WiredTiger storage engine. To reuse a connection, pass it to the `apostrophe-db` module as the `db` option.

* Fixed a MongoDB 3.6 incompatibility in the ""Apply to Subpages"" feature for permissions. Also made this feature available again when *removing* someone's permissions. We plan further UX work here to make this feature easier to understand and use.

* UX fix to the ""manage tags"" dialog box: don't attempt to add an empty tag. Thanks to Anthony Tarlao.

* Warn developers if they use bad area names.

* For those deploying asset bundles to S3: the command line task that builds an asset bundle no longer requires access to your production database, although it still needs to start up normally with access to a database in the pre-production environment where you are building the bundle.

* Refactoring of the trash field deduplication features, in preparation to extend them to pages as well in an upcoming release."

* **Security:** numerous issues formerly flagged by the new `npm audit` command have been addressed. We are now using a [maintained branch of lodash 3.x](https://github.com/sailshq/lodash) to keep bc while addressing security (many thanks to the Sails team). We are also using LESS 3.x, which has caused no issues in our testing and corrects security concerns with LESS 2.x. Numerous `npm audit` security reports regarding `imagemin` modules were addressed by removing `imagemin` from `uploadfs` itself, however you may opt into it via the new [`postprocessors` option of `uploadfs`](https://github.com/punkave/uploadfs). As of this writing, one `npm audit` complaint remains: the `azure-storage` module needs to update a dependency to address a possible vulnerability. You may mitigate this issue by not using the `azure` backend of `uploadfs` with Apostrophe until it is resolved upstream.
* Many UI enhancements when choosing, browsing and managing items which reduce user confusion. For instance: moving items up and down in a selection no longer refreshes the entire list and forces the user to scroll down again. Trashed pages are easier to distinguish in ""reorganize."" ""More"" dropdown for pieces is again fully visible when clicked. Placeholder helpers make the search field for joins easier to understand. Chevrons added to various select elements which were difficult to identify as dropdowns before.
* Deeply nested areas now save properly. Formerly in certain situations the same widget might be duplicated.
* `apos.tasks.getReq` now supplies an empty `req.data` object for easier use with code expecting an Express request, Apostrophe-style.
* Bedeviled by case-sensitive sorting? The `sortify: true` property for `string` schema fields is now documented and automatically creates a database migration to ensure it is available for your existing data as well. When used, this flag ensures that any `sort('fieldname')` call for that field in Apostrophe is case-insensitive, ignores punctuation and otherwise behaves as end users expect."

* Security fix: uploaded images ""in the trash"" were still accessible at the same URL in most sizes. This has been corrected. As documented, the only size that now remains accessible is the `one-sixth` size, and this choice can be changed or eliminated entirely. **This bug did not affect other file attachments, such as PDFs.**

As always, be sure to run the `apostrophe-migrations:migrate` task. This will make sure the permissions of your files are correct. Harmless warnings may appear for those that were already correct.

* The `apostrophe-attachments:migrate-to-disabled-file-key` and `apostrophe-attachments:migrate-from-disabled-file-key` have been added for the convenience of those using the `disabledFileKey` option to `uploadfs` to rename disabled files in a cryptographically sound way rather than changing their permissions. These are relevant only with the `local` storage option of `uploadfs`, since since the option is neither available nor necessary for S3, and is mandatory for Azure from the beginning.

* Although technically part of UploadFS 1.9.0, we'd like to note that the `azure` storage backend is now available and can be part of your `uploadfs` configuration for the `apostrophe-attachments` module.

* Server-side modules can now extend the buttons available in the ""manage"" modal of pieces without overriding templates, similar to the way they are extensible in the ""edit"" modal.

* UX fixes.

* Cropping an image through Apostrophe now works when attachments are stored in S3, Azure, etc.

* Date parsing does not generate `momentjs` warnings.

* Overrideable block in the outerLayout for the context menu.

* The `apostrophe-soft-redirects` module now accepts a `statusCode` option, which you may change to `301` to use hard redirects. Thanks to Leo Melzer."

* Several performance improvements. In situations where Apostrophe formerly made expensive ""matching nothing"" queries, Apostrophe now either skips the entire query or uses an efficient query for a nonexistent `_id`, depending on whether the method in question has the right to cancel the entire operation.
* Resources released more completely by `apos.destroy`, which can now satisfy the expectations of `mocha` 5.x (no timeouts left active, etc). This was done by adding a `destroy` method to `uploadfs`.
* `range` schema fields behave better when there is no existing value.
* Save operation of a modal now triggers the global busy state to prevent race conditions and other unwanted behavior.
* Global busy state can now be pushed and popped, and modals utilize this, so that a modal can be used to gather information during the `saveContent` method of another modal."

* The named anchor `main` can now be overridden via the `mainAnchor` nunjucks block.
* The `npmRootDir` option can be used to cause Apostrophe's module loading mechanism to seek npm modules in a location other than that specified by `rootDir` (or the project root). The new `localesDir` option of `apostrophe-i18n` does the same for localization. This makes it possible to use `rootDir` to specify an alternate location for everything else, i.e. the parent of `public`, `data`, `lib/modules`, etc. A necessary accommodation for the evolving `apostrophe-multisite` module.
* Raw HTML widgets now offer help text out of the box.
* The `express.static` middleware now runs before the `apostrophe-global` middleware and other ""standard"" Apostrophe middleware.
* Your own module-level `expressMiddleware` object can specify `{ when: 'beforeRequired', middleware: function(req, res, next) { ... })` to run before the required middleware as well. Note that this means no sessions, no users and no body parser. Most of the time you'll want those things.
* CSS adjustment to tabs in modals so they don't scroll in Firefox.
* Dropzones for empty areas are easier to drop onto."

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* No more 404's when slugs change for pages and pieces. Apostrophe now automatically implements ""soft redirects"" to the new URL of a page or piece. This is a major SEO improvement, with good support for any page or piece with a `._url` property. Note that this feature ""learns"" URLs over time as the pages and pieces are actually accessed, so if you decide to test it, remember that you must access the old URL at least once before you change it for the test. This feature can be disabled, if you really want to, by setting the `enable` option of the `apostrophe-soft-redirects` module to `false`.
* Indexed queries on the `parkedId` and `advisoryLock._id` properties. The lack of indexes for these properties could lead to full collection scans, so this is a significant performance boost on large databases.
* Apostrophe's anti-CSRF forgery X-XSRF-TOKEN header is no longer sent as part of an OPTIONS request, or as part of a cross-domain request. In the first case, cookies cannot be set by the server anyway, and in the second, we are communicating with a server that cannot see our session to verify it. In both cases, sending the headers was causing configuration headaches for developers. Thanks to Priyansh Gupta.
* A UI bug fix: the recently added ""clone"" button for widgets is no longer displayed for singletons, or for areas whose `limit` has been reached. Also, the `cloneable: false` option can be used to disable this feature for a particular area.
* UI bug fix: no more conflicts between the ""Add Content"" menu and the up/down/remove/etc. buttons for widgets.
* Clearer warnings and error messages."

* Widget fields may now have a `permission` property. If present, the user must have the named permission (such as `admin`), or they will not see that particular field in the editing dialog box. This is useful when a widget should be authorable by most users but has a sensitive field that should be restricted to a smaller group of users. Note that this feature already existed for schema fields of pieces and pages.
* Apostrophe again allows a named pipe to be specified via the `PORT` environment variable, for compatibility with Windows. Thanks to Jørgen M. Skogås for this fix.
* Apostrophe's default settings for the `bodyParser` option are now generous enough, in the case of JSON request bodies, to cover all reasonable editing scenarios in Apostrophe. This change also benefits the `apostrophe-headless` module.
* When Apostrophe must generate a `path` for a new page, it will look at the provided `slug` before it looks at the provided `title`. This is useful when titles in an import are of poor quality but slugs are unique. Prevents unnecessary numbered suffixes after both slugs and paths.
* The dropdown menu to add a widget no longer has a conflict with the hover menu offering widget controls such as ""up,"" ""down,"" etc. The hover menu does not appear while the dropdown menu is open."

* New features for displaying the titles of array items when editing fields of type `array`. `titleField` may now use dot notation. In addition, if that isn't enough, you may use `listItemTemplate` to point to an alternative to the standard `arrayListItem.html` template, which you may use as a reference. In addition, both `titleField` dot notation and the custom `listItemTemplate` have full access to joins. Be sure to use cross-module include syntax if you don't want to put the template in `lib/modules/apostrophe-schemas/views`. For instance, you may write `listItemTemplate: 'my-module-name:listItemTemplate.html'`.
* Bug fix: modals are the right height when jQuery 3 is in use.
* CSS class added to the `h4` that displays the title in an `apostrophe-images` widget, for your CSS styling convenience. Thanks to Gareth Cooper."

* New `color` and `range` schema field types. `color` provides a color picker field allowing values compatible with CSS, etc. `range` provides an `<input type=""range"">` element and respects `min` and `max` options.
* New `apos.utils.log`, `apos.utils.info`, `apos.utils.debug`, `apos.utils.warn` and `apos.utils.error` methods. These are now used consistently throughout Apostrophe core, both in the server and in the browser. On the server, these methods wrap the corresponding methods of a `logger` object and you can inject your own via the `logger` option of the `apostrophe-utils` module. By default a logger object that wraps the `console` object is created. For convenience, if your logger has no `log` method, `apos.utils.log` will call `logger.info`. This allows many popular loggers like `winston` to be used without modification ""out of the box.""
* `modulesSubdir` option to specify subdir where local modules come from, overriding `lib/modules`. Useful when more than one `apos` object exists in a project.
* Major speedup to parked pages. Also eliminates spurious warnings about inefficient joins at startup.
* Refactored autocollapse behavior of admin bar into its own method for easier overrides.
* CSS fixes for improved usability."

Regression tests passing.

* Developers now have the option to use jQuery 3. To enable jQuery 3, set the `jQuery` option of the `apostrophe-assets` module to the number `3`. We have packaged specific versions of jQuery 3 and jQuery UI which are known to be compatible with and tested with Apostrophe's UI, and we plan to use these in our own projects going forward. We will be making this change in the apostrophe boilerplate project. Of course Apostrophe's UI remains compatible with the older version of jQuery that loads by default. There is no bc break.

* When you join with pages, by using the virtual doc type `apostrophe-page`, the user is now invited to choose a page via a version of the reorganize dialog box, which has been made more user-friendly for this purpose. Autocomplete is still supported too.

* The reorganize dialog box is more pleasant to use. This dialog will continue to evolve to offer more of the functionality found in the ""manage"" dialog boxes for piece types.

* The page parking mechanism has been overhauled and improved. From now on, it is our recommendation that you set a unique `parkedId` for each parked page you configure for `apostrophe-pages`. This ensures that even if you change the slug in the configuration of the parked page, Apostrophe will still be able to understand that the page already exists and a new one should not be inserted. This is especially critical if using `apostrophe-workflow`, since you might decide to add or change locale prefixes at some point.

* The database connection keepalive mechanism now uses a query against an empty collection, rather than a server status call that the database user might not have permission to make.

* The `apos.utils.cssName` helper now preserves double dashes, as they are a common feature in modern CSS frameworks.

* There is now an `apostrophe-areas:widgetBase.html` file which can be extended block by block in a project-level `lib/modules/apostrophe-areas/views/widget.html` file. New overrideable methods have also been added to simplify adding custom classes programmatically to the wrapper and the widget itself without overriding any templates.

* It is now possible to configure select elements (we do not recommend more than one) to be displayed inline with the other widget controls, i.e. up, down, delete, etc. The back end of this is left to the developer, however you can check out the still-evolving [apostrophe-personas](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-personas) module for an example. This feature is primarily meant for modules like `apostrophe-personas` that impact all widgets in a general way."

* The ""Copy"" button of pieces now copies areas that do not explicitly appear in the schema, and works correctly when an `apostrophe-pieces` module is set `contextual: true`. Overrideable methods are provided for those who need to copy more than schema fields and top-level areas. We do not copy every property by default because this could have unforeseen consequences; we copy only what is in the schema, plus top-level areas because these have always been supported without an explicit schema in templates.

* It is now possible to secure widget properties so that they are not visible to end users if you do not choose to output them in the markup. To do that, set the `playerData` option of your widget module to `false`, or to an array of properties that **should** be visible in the `data` JSON attribute so that they are passed to the `play()` method. Normally widget properties are public information, intended for display, but this technique is useful if you have a `username` and `password` for use in fetching an external feed in a server-side `load` method, for instance. **Note that to allow widget editing to function, everything is still passed in `data` if the user has editing privileges for the widget.** So if you seek to verify this feature, be sure to check as a logged-out user, or a user without editing permissions for that content.

* It is now easy to override the `fieldset` markup for Apostrophe schemas. Just copy `lib/modules/apostrophe-schemas/views/fieldset.html` to your project-level version of that path and edit it. However, please note that you must continue to have an outer wrapper element with the given attributes.

* Apostrophe's codebase now passes `eslint`. In the process many cases of callback errors being ignored were fixed, as well as global variable leaks.

* Apostrophe's `apos.locks.lock` and `apos.locks.unlock` methods now support promises."

* The `apostrophe-caches` module has better, clearer documentation and it now supports promises.
* All modules can now conveniently send email using [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/). The new `email` method of all modules renders a template in that module's `views` folder, exactly as you would hope it would, and also automatically generates a plaintext version for the occasional user who does not view HTML email. The automatically generated versions include links properly.
* Extending `apostrophe-images-widgets` and other pieces widgets is easier. If your widget name doesn't correspond to the kind of piece you are displaying, a helpful error appears explaining that you need to set `piecesModuleName`. Adding fields to these widgets now behaves reasonably. Also, if you add fields to `apostrophe-images` or `apostrophe-files` at project level, this now behaves as expected too.
* A locking mechanism has been added during the movement of pages in the page tree. This prevents rare race conditions that could previously have resulted in duplicate page ranks, although the design of the page tree is such that more serious consequences were always avoided.
* Text justification options for ckeditor are now standard in our build of ckeditor. Of course you still need to configure `sanitize-html` properly when using them.
* Any widgets module may now specify a `wrapperTemplate` option. That template is rendered instead of the standard `apostrophe-areas:widget.html` template, and can use `extends` and override blocks found in that template. This is useful if you need to set attributes of the outer wrapper element of the widget.
* The migration added in 2.43.0 to address file permissions for existing attachments in the trash has been greatly accelerated, helpful on large sites.
* Better error messages for `min` and `max` options of some schema field types; provisions for expanded error messages in general.
* For those using the `testModule` option to test their own npm modules in the context of Apostrophe, a default shortname is automatically provided.
* Fixed missing space in admin bar markup, thanks to arlecchino."

* Apostrophe's AJAX filter features for `apostrophe-pieces-pages` now support ""Load More"" buttons and infinite scroll.

To add a ""Load More"" button:

1. Wrap a new element inside your data-apos-ajax-context element around the content that makes up the current ""page"" of results. This should not wrap around filter links or the ""Load More"" button itself.
2. Give that new element the `data-apos-ajax-append` attribute.
3. Add `append=1` to the query string of your Load More button. Example:

```
{% if data.currentPage < data.totalPages %}
  <a href=""{{ data.url }} | build({ page: data.currentPage + 1, append: 1 })"">Load More...</a>
{% endif %}
```

To progressively enhance this for infinite scroll, add a `data-apos-ajax-infinite-scroll` attribute to the button.

Note that we do this via progressive enhancement of a ""Load More"" button so that Google can still reach and index all of the pages (SEO).

* Attachment schema fields now respect the new `fileGroup` and `fileGroups` properties. If `fileGroup` is set to `images`, then only image types (GIF, JPEG, PNG) are accepted; if it is set to `office` only typical business file types are accepted. Note that we have always rejected files that didn't appear on the list for either type. You can also specify `fileGroups` as an array.
* `fileGroup: 'image'` is now configured by default for `apostrophe-images`, as was always intended but incorrectly implemented in the past.
* Attachment schema fields now respect the new `extension` and `extensions` properties. The former is handy if you only want to allow one extension, the latter if you want to allow more than one. The extensions must be those specified for `fileGroups` in the default configuration of `apostrophe-attachments` or your override of it (all lower case; JPEG is `jpg`; no period).
* The `addDocReferences` migration has been parallelized, as this one-time migration can be time-consuming on a large site.
* Broken `less` calculation fixed, thanks to Antoine COMBES."

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* When a ""file"" or ""image"" is moved to the trash, the attachment in question now becomes inaccessible. This is particularly important to stop access to obsolete PDFs, which Google loves to access. If the file or image is removed from the trash, the attachment becomes available again. In the case of images, the 1/6th size remains available by default to provide preview when viewing the trash. If the same attachment is referenced by more than one doc, which can happen due to ""Copy"" operations or `apostrophe-workflow`, it remains available until all such docs are in the trash.

* Parked properties are no longer editable in page settings. Since every site restart always wiped them out anyway, this is a bug fix, not a truly new behavior. With this change, you can finally set `type: 'home'` when `park`ing the home page, and remove `home` from your page types dropdown.

* The `apostrophe-jobs` module now offers a `runNonBatch` method, which is useful for long-running operations that don't involve iterating over many instances of the same type of object.

* Improvements to background image positioning for images widgets.

* A block has been added to override the `lang` attribute easily. Thanks to Ayho.

* The `imgAlt` block can now be used to conveniently override the `alt` attribute of images when overriding `widget.html` for `apostrophe-images-widgets`. Thanks to Raphaël DiRago.

* The `required` option now works properly for fields of type `array` (there must be at least one item in the array).

* Improved error messages for unblessed widget schemas. These are usually related to a widget that is no longer in the page template but appears in the database.

* A UI bug that caused tabs to become invisible when returning from nested dialog boxes has been fixed.

* Filters for ""select"" fields now default to ""no opinion,"" rather than the default choice. This is the normal behavior for other field types.

* Even more promise support! `apos.attachments.insert`, `pieces.trash` and `pieces.rescue` all return promises if no callback is given.

* A YouTube embed unit test was removed to ensure consistent results in Travis CI, which is once again in routine use."

* Promises have landed in Apostrophe. Calling `toArray`, `toObject`, `toDistinct` or `toMongo` on an Apostrophe cursor *without a callback* will return a promise. That promise will resolve to the expected result.

In addition, `docs.insert`, `docs.update`, `pieces.insert`, `pieces.update`, and `pages.insert` will all return a promise if invoked without a callback.

These are the most frequently invoked functions in Apostrophe that formerly required callbacks.

**As always with promises, be sure to catch errors with `.catch()`** at some level.

Note that **the `await` keyword can now be used with these methods**, as long as you're running Node.js 8.x or newer or using Babel to provide that language feature.

* Apostrophe's custom `Split` CKEditor toolbar control now works correctly in 2.x. You can give your users the `Split` control to allow them to break up a large rich text widget in order to insert other types of widget ""in the middle."" Note that the control name is now capitalized to match the way other CKEditor toolbar buttons are named.

* You may now specify `_url: 1` or `_nameOfJoin: 1` in a projection when using Apostrophe's `find()` methods. Native MongoDB projections naturally can't see these ""computed properties"" because they don't live in the database — they are computed ""on the fly"" after documents are fetched. However, Apostrophe now automatically adds the right underlying fields to the projection.

Only `_url` and the names of `joinByOne` or `joinByArray` fields are supported. It does not make sense to use a projection on `people` to locate IDs that are actually attached to `products` via `joinByOneReverse` or `joinByArrayReverse`.

*This feature does not conflict with legitimate uses of MongoDB projections because Apostrophe discards all properties beginning with `_` when writing to the database, except for `_id`.*

* The `length` property of an Apostrophe `attachment` object is now correctly populated with the original file size. Thanks to David Keita. Note that images are also made available in many scaled sizes. Also the original may be replaced with a correctly rotated version, in which case `length` will not match. So the most useful scenario for this property is likely to be in working with office formats, especially PDF which can sometimes be very large.

* Fixed bug in the `isEmpty` methods for areas and singletons. Thanks to David Keita."

* The new `apostrophe-jobs` module, part of the core of Apostrophe, provides a progress meter mechanism and the ability to stop long-running user-initiated operations, such as batch operations on pieces. See the [jobs module documentation](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/modules/apostrophe-jobs/index.html). You can also refer to the pieces module for examples if you wish to use this for your own long-running user-initiated operations.
* Batch operations now have more robust support for ""select everything."" A number of bugs related to multiple selection of pieces have been fixed in a refactoring that made this code much more maintainable and predictable.
* The option of pushing an asset of type `template`, which never worked in 2.x and was never used by Apostrophe, has been removed for clarity. Our preference is for rendering assets on the server side dynamically when needed, rather than pushing many templates into the DOM on every page load.
* An `.editorconfig` file has been added. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* Parking a page only pushes permanent properties. `_defaults` and `_children` should never have been in the database; they are of course still interpreted to decide what should happen, but the properties *themselves* did not belong in the database. (You may need to write a migration if they are already there and this is causing issues for you.)
* Scrolling UI behavior of pieces improved; various other UI touch-ups. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* `newBrowserCalls` helper for `push` module can be used when you want JavaScript calls queued up with `req.browserCall` to be executed in an AJAX update of just part of a page.
* Fixed bugs affecting access to the published/unpublished batch operations and similar."

Once you check the box to select everything on the current page, you are given a secondary option to select everything that matches your current criteria. This works both when choosing pieces for widgets and when working with batch operations like ""trash"" or ""rescue.""
* Fixed various bugs affecting combinations of ""select all on page"", the chooser and working with images.
* Improvements to batch operations on pieces. The `requiredField` property is checked correctly, and the new `onlyIf` property allows for passing a function that accepts the doc type name and decides whether the button should appear. Multiword action names are properly camelcased. New ""success"" and ""dataSource"" options to `batchSimple` allow for carrying out additional operations afterward as well as gathering input independently at the start. And batch operations are composed late so that other modules can add them.
* The `self.api` and `self.html` methods of `apostrophe-context` and `apostrophe-modal` now support a syntax for making cross-module API calls, just like templates.
* Addressed moog versioning issue with latest npm that caused errors about ""synth.instanceOf"" not being found depending on the state of your npm cache."

* Easier access to options. Introduced the `getOption` method to all modules. Calling `self.getOption(req, 'sizes.large')` from your module's server-side JavaScript code, or just `module.getOption('sizes.large')` from Nunjucks, will return the value of `self.options.sizes.large` for that module. You may also pass an array of keys, i.e. `module.getOption([ 'sizes', 'large' ])`. This method is tolerant, it returns undefined if any part of the path does not exist. See also the new [apostrophe-override-options](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-override-options) which extends this feature to support customizing the returned value for any option based on the current page type, page settings, piece settings and locale. * Helpful warning when maximum area/widget loader recursion level is reached. Always use projections when adding joins to your schema to avoid a performance hit due to runaway recursion.
* New `disabledTypes` option to `apostrophe-pages`, primarily for use with `apostrophe-override-options`.
* Fixed UI bug relating to area menus at the bottom of the page.
* Fixed bug that caused a crash when invalid usernames attempted to log in. Thanks to Arthur."

* The conflict resolution feature, which helps users avoid conflicts in which neither is successfully able to save content reliably by explaining that two users are editing the same doc and offering the option of taking control, can now be disabled by setting the `conflictResolution` option of the `apostrophe-docs` module explicitly to `false`. **We do not recommend** the use of this option in normal practice, however it has valid applications in automated testing.

* Recently a bug was introduced in which extensions other than `.html` or `.njk` did not work in `include` statements, etc. in Nunjucks templates unless the file in question existed in the project-level version of the module including it. The full cascade of template folder paths is now supported for these explicit extensions, including searching `viewsFolderFallback`."

* Attempts to drag a page below the trashcan are rejected gracefully.

* When on page two (or higher) in the ""manage"" view of pieces, performing a text search now correctly resets to page one.
* Throw an error at startup if a forbidden schema field name is used in `addFields` configuration. For instance, `type` is forbidden for widget schemas, while `docPermissions` is forbidden for doc type schemas, and `_id` is forbidden for both. Note that field names like `title` that are already in the schema are *not* forbidden because re-adding a schema field replaces it, which is often done to change the label, etc. So we'll be adding more documentation about these to help developers avoid surprises if their intention was an entirely new field."

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* `apos.areas.isEmpty(data.page, 'body')` will now tell you if that area is considered empty (it contains no widgets, or the widgets consider themselves empty).

* The new `controls` option may be passed to any widget, via `apos.singleton` or via the configuration for that specific widget type in an `apos.area` call. In this example, the widget cannot be removed, cannot be moved, and has its controls positioned at the upper right instead of the upper left:

```
{{
  apos.singleton(data.page, 'footer', 'apostrophe-rich-text', {
    controls: {
      removable: false,
      movable: false,
      position: 'top-right'
      }
    }
  })
}}
```

The `position` suboption may be set to `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left` or `bottom-right`.

The `removable` and `movable` suboptions are primarily intended for singletons.

* By popular demand, the `insert` and `update` methods of pieces now pass the piece to their callback as the second argument.

* Better CSS reset for Apostrophe's admin UI.

* `callOne` added for convenience when you want to invoke a method normally invoked by `callAll` in the same way, but for only one module. Thanks to Arthur.

* If an attachment does not exist, `apos.attachments.url` no longer results in a template error page. Instead a fallback icon is displayed and an error message is logged. Developers should still always check whether attachments and joined objects still exist in their templates. Thanks to Raphaël DiRago.

* Notifications within modals move to lower right corner of modal for readability.

* Cleaned up font paths.

* Accommodations for the latest release of the separately published apostrophe-workflow module."

* Conflict resolution has been added to Apostrophe. When two users attempt to edit the same document, whether ""in context"" on the page or via a dialog box, Apostrophe now makes the latecomer aware of the issue and gives them the option to take control of the document after warning that the first party could lose work.

Since the first user may have simply abandoned their work, Apostrophe also indicates how long it has been since the first user last made a change.

If the same user attempts to edit a document in two tabs or windows, something very similar happens, although the message is different.

* In a related change, Apostrophe does not begin attempting to save an area on the page until the user interacts with it for the first time. This fixes many commonly reported frustrating situations in which one user is editing and the other is logged in but merely looking at the page, creating a ping-pong exchange of save requests.

* Apostrophe's unit tests have been restructured so that a single test file can be run conveniently, via `mocha test/docs.js`, for instance, and there is no longer a need for us to update `test/test.js` every time a test is added. Also, the unit tests use the same `apos.tasks.getReq` and `apos.tasks.getAnonReq` methods that are used by real-life command line tasks, which provide a more faithful simulation of an Express request object and one we anticipate extending as needed."

* Refactoring: the `apostrophe-login` module now has an `afterLogin` method which takes care of invoking the `loginAfterLogin` callAll method on all modules that have one, and then redirecting appropriately. This code was factored out to make it easier to use in the new [apostrophe-passport](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-passport) module, which allows the use of almost any [Passport](http://passportjs.org)-based strategy, such as Facebook login, Google login, Github login, etc.

This is a feature for those writing their own npm modules that wish to unit test by initializing Apostrophe and loading the module in question.

* Fixed caching bugs, notably the oembed cache, which is now operating properly. Oembed responses, such as YouTube iframe markup, are now cached for an hour as originally intended which improves frontend loading time.

* Page type changes only refreshed the schema fields on the first change — now they do it properly after every change.

* Page type changes use the ""busy"" mechanism while refreshing the schema fields to prevent user interface race conditions and avoid user confusion.

* `trash` is never offered as a schema field of the `global` doc (mainly a concern with `apostrophe-workflow`)."

      name: 'connect-redis',
      options: {

For bc, you can still pass a live instance of a store as the `store` option, but this way is easier; all you have to do is `npm install --save` your connect-compatible session store of choice and configure it.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work."

This is a significant update containing various accommodations required by the shortly forthcoming Apostrophe 2.x version of the `apostrophe-workflow` module, as well as other recent enhancements in our queue.

* Editing an area ""in context"" on the page when it is part of a widget or piece will always work, even if `contextual: true` was not set. That property is optional and prevents the area from also appearing in the dialog box for editing the content type.

* Multiple select filters are now available for the ""manage"" view of any piece type. Just like configuring single-select filters, except that you'll add `multiple: true` to the relevant object in your `addFilters` configuration for the module. Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

* When editing a previous selection of pieces for a join or widget, you can also easily edit them without locating them again in the manage view.

* ""Next"" and ""previous"" links can now be easily added to your `show.html` pages for pieces. Just set the `next` and `previous` options for your `apostrophe-pieces-pages` subclass to `true`, or to an object with a `projection` property for best performance. This will populate `data.previous` and `data.next` in your `show.html` template. *For blogs they may seem backwards; they refer to relative position on the index page, and blogs are reverse-chronological. Just switch the terms on the front end in your template in cases where they appear confusing.*

* There is now a ""pages"" option on the admin bar, for cases where ""reorganize"" is not visible because ""Page Settings"" is not accessible to the user for the current page.

* If the `trashInSchema` option is set to `true` when configuring `apostrophe-docs`, pages that are in the trash retain their position in the page tree rather than moving to a separate ""trash"" subtree. In the ""reorganize"" interface, they are grouped into trash cans displayed beneath each parent page, rather than a single global trash can. This is necessary for the new workflow module and also helpful in any situation where trying to find pages in the trash is more troublesome than explaining this alternative approach.

When `trashInSchema` is `true`, users can also change the trash status of a piece or page via ""Page Settings"" or the ""Edit"" dialog box of the piece, and it is possible to access ""Page Settings"" for any page via ""Reorganize.""

* The buttons displayed for each widget in an Apostrophe area can be adjusted via the `addWidgetControlGroups` option of the `apostrophe-areas` module, which can be used to introduce additional buttons.

* Empty `beforeMove` and `afterMove` methods have been added to the `apostrophe-pages` module for the convenience of modules using `improve` to enhance it.

* The `apostrophe-doc-type-manager` module now has `getEditPermissionName` and `getAdminPermissionName` methods. These can be overridden by subclasses. For instance, all page subtypes return `edit-apostrophe-page` for the former because page types can be changed.

* `apos.destroy(function() { ... })` may be called to shut down a running Apostrophe instance. This does **not** delete any data. It simply releases the database connection, HTTP server port, etc. This mechanism is extensible by implementing an `apostropheDestroy` method in your own module.

* `before` option for `expressMiddleware`. As before any module can provide middleware via an `expressMiddleware` property which may be a function or array of functions. In addition, if that property is an object, it may also have a `before` subproperty specifying a module whose middleware should run after it. In this case the actual middleware function or functions must be in a `middleware` subproperty.

* `apos.instancesOf(name)` returns an array of modules that extend `name` or a subclass of it. `apos.instanceOf(object, name)` returns true if the given `object` is a moog instance of `name` or a subclass of it.

* `apos.permissions.criteria` can now supply MongoDB criteria restricted to the types the user can edit when a general permission name like `edit` or `edit-doc` is asked for. *This was never a security bug because permissions for actual editing were checked when individual edits occurred. The change makes it easier to display lists of editable content of mixed types.*

* Extending the indexes of Apostrophe's `aposDocs` collection is easier to achieve in modules that use `improve` to extend `apostrophe-docs`.

* Removed tests for obsolete, unsupported Node.js 0.10.x. Node.js 4.x is now the minimum version. *We do not intend to break ES5 compliance in 2.x, however testing old versions of Node that are not maintained with security patches in any freely available repository is not practical.*

* `insert` method for `apos.attachments`, mirroring the other modules better. Thanks to Arthur Agombart."

* Lazy schema field configuration, in general and especially for joins. No more need to specify `idField`, `idsField`, `relationshipsField` or even `label` for your schema fields. `withType` can be inferred too in many cases, depending on the name of the join field. You can still specify all of the details by hand.

Also, for reverse joins, there is a new `reverseOf` option, allowing you to just specify the name of the join you are reversing. This is much easier to understand than specifying the `idField` of the other join. However that is still permitted.

Lazy configuration is in place for doc types (like pages and pieces) and widget types. It can be extended to other uses of schemas by calling the new validation methods.

* ckeditor 4.6.2. Resolves #896: you can now create links properly in Microsoft Edge. Our policy is now to check in periodically with new ckeditor releases and just make sure they are compatible with our editor skin before releasing them.

* `apos.areas.fromRichText` can be used to create an area with a single rich text widget from a trusted string of HTML. Not intended for mixed media, just rich text. Related: both `fromRichText` and `fromPlaintext` now correctly give their widgets an `_id` property."

* Do not crash on missing widget types, print good warning messages.

* Complete implementation of the [explicitOrder](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/modules/apostrophe-docs/server-apostrophe-cursor.html#explicit-order) cursor filter, replacing a nonfunctional implementation.

* If the mongodb connection is lost, the default behavior is now to retry it forever, so when MongoDB does get restarted Apostrophe will find it. In addition, a `connect` object may be passed to the `apostrophe-db` module to be passed on to the MongoDB connect call.

* Spaces added between DOM attributes for better HTML5 compliance.

* `required` subfields are now enforced when editing fields of type `array`.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of much of the work in this release."

* Apostrophe now supports publishing CSS and JS assets via S3 rather than serving them directly.

Apostrophe already had an option to build asset ""bundles"" and deploy them at startup, as described in our [cloud HOWTO](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud.html). However this serves the assets from the cloud webserver, such as a Heroku dyno or EC2 instance. It is now possible to serve the assets from Amazon S3.

See the [updated cloud HOWTO](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud.html) for details.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

* Enforce string field `min` and `max` properties on server side.

* When validation of a form with tabs fails, such as a pieces edit modal, activate the correct tab and scroll to the first error in that tab.

* thanks to Ludovic Bret for fixing a bug in the admin bar markup."

* For a small performance boost, `defer` option can be set to `true` when configuring any widget module.
This defers calls to the `load` method until just before the page is rendered, allowing a single query
to fetch them all in simple cases. This is best applied
to the `apostrophe-images-widgets` module and similar widgets. It should not be applied if you wish
to access the results of the join in asynchronous code, because they are not available until the last
possible moment.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

* You can also set `deferImageLoading` to `true` for the `apostrophe-globals` module if you want the
same technique to be applied when loading the `global` doc's widgets. This does not always yield a
performance improvement.

* Bug fix: if two crops of the same image were present in separate widgets on a page, only one of the crops would be seen in template code. This issue has been resolved."

Finally, the `crop: true` option for attachments is saved successfully. This option allows for attachments to have a crop that is inherent to them, useful when there is no widget standing between the doc and the attachment.

All tests passing.

* Reintroduced the reorganize feature for editors who have permissions for some pages but not others. You are able to see the pages you can edit and also their ancestors, in order to navigate the tree. However you are able to drag pages only to parents you can edit.

* Introduced the new `deleteFromTrash` option to the `apostrophe-pages` module. If this option is enabled, a new icon appears in ""reorganize"" when looking at pages in the trash. This icon allows you to permanently delete a page and its descendants from the site.

The use of this option can lead to unhappy customers if they do not clearly understand it is a permanent action. For that reason, it is disabled by default. However it can be quite useful when transitioning from the initial site build to long-term support. We recommend enabling it during that period and disabling it again after cleanup.

* ""Reorganize"" no longer displays nonfunctional ""view"" and ""trash"" icons for the trash and pages inside it.

* The tests for the `apostrophe-locks` module are now deterministic and should always pass."

All tests passing.

* Two major new features in this release: built-in filters for most schema fields, and built-in AJAX support for `apostrophe-pieces-pages`. These combine to eliminate the need for custom code in a wide array of situations where you wish to allow users to browse and filter blog posts, events, etc. In most cases there is no longer any need to write your own `cursor.js` or your own AJAX implementation. The provided AJAX implementation handles browser history operations, bookmarking and sharing properly and is SEO-friendly.

[See the official summary of the pull request for details and examples of usage.](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe/pull/766)

* We also fixed a bug in the `refinalize` feature of cursors. state.criteria is now cloned before finalize and restored after it. Otherwise many criteria are added twice after refinalize which causes a fatal error with a few, like text search in mongodb.

In addition, we merged a contribution from Fotis Paraskevopoulos that allows a `bodyParser` option with `json` and `urlencoded` properties to be passed to the `apostrophe-express` module. Those properties are passed on to configure those two body parser middleware functions."

Add a `data-apos-ajax-context=""name""` attribute to the outer div that should be refreshed when any link or form submission inside it takes place and has a URL that points back to the same page. Boom that's it. The `name` must be unique on the page, which is always the case for pieces index pages, but this provision is made as a starting point toward allowing multiple AJAX environments on the page for widget filters. Doing so would require considerable thought toward using nonconflicting query parameters and passing others on. It may never turn out to be a wise idea, we just don't want to slam the door on it.
* Text fields and textareas in the AJAX context are *not* replaced, so that submitting the form on keyboard events does not result in broken input behavior. Their ancestors are also not replaced.
* Implemented new slug-based join filters. The slug-based versions do *not* take the leading `_` in their names, which is perfect because they are seen by the public in query strings. Programmers will expect the versions with the `_` and pass ids to them and get what they expect. Nerdvana.
* Unit tests for the slug-based join filters.
* Fixed a bug in the `refinalize` feature of cursors. state.criteria is now cloned before finalize and restored after it. Otherwise many criteria are added twice after refinalize which causes a fatal error with a few, like text search in mongodb.
* Refactored and cleaned up my code for generating join filter choices to be clearer and less redundant."

* `APOS_MONGODB_URI` environment variable is used to connect to MongoDB if present. Helpful for cloud hosting. See the new [deploying Apostrophe in the cloud HOWTO](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud.html).
* `APOS_S3_BUCKET`, `APOS_S3_ENDPOINT` (optional), `APOS_S3_SECRET`, `APOS_S3_KEY`, and `APOS_S3_REGION` environment variables can be used to configure Apostrophe to use S3 for uploaded media storage. This behavior kicks in if `APOS_S3_BUCKET` is set. See the new [deploying Apostrophe in the cloud HOWTO](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud.html).
* New advisory locking API accessible via `apos.locks.lock` and `apos.locks.unlock`. `apostrophe-migrations:migrate` is now wrapped in a lock. More locks are coming, although Apostrophe was carefully designed for benign worst case outcomes during race conditions.
* Better asset deployment for Heroku and other cloud services. `node app apostrophe:generation --create-bundle=NAME` now creates a new folder, `NAME`, containing assets that would otherwise have been written to `public`. Launching a server with the `APOS_BUNDLE` environment variable set to `NAME` will then copy that bundle's contents into `public` before listening for connections. See the new [deploying Apostrophe in the cloud HOWTO](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud.html).
* `apostrophe-pieces-pages` index pages are about 2x faster; discovered we were inefficiently deep-cloning `req` when cloning a cursor.
* Helpful error message if you forget to set the `name` property of one of your `types` when configuring `apostrophe-pages`."

* We do a better job of defaulting to a sort by search match quality if full-text search is present in a query. Under the hood this is powered by the new `defaultSort` filter, which just stores a default value for the `sort` filter to be used only if `search` (and anything else with an implicit preferred sort order) is not present. No more lame search results for blog posts. You can explicitly set the `sort()` filter in a cursor override if you really want to, but trust us, when `search` is present sorting by anything but search quality produces poor results.
* Fixed bugs in the sanitizer for page slugs. It is now impossible to save a slug with trailing or consecutive slashes (except the home page slug which is allowed to consist of a single ""trailing"" slash). Added unit tests.
* Apostrophe's dropdown menus, etc. will more robustly maintain their font size in the presence of project-level CSS. There is an explicit default font size for `.apos-ui`."

Useful in implementing importers.
* The so-called `csv` import mode of `apos.schemas.convert` works properly for areas, using the above. Although it is called csv this mode is really suitable for any situation in which you have plaintext representations of each property in an object and would like those sanitized and converted to populate a doc.
* Bug fix: emit the `enhance` Apostrophe event only once on page load. This event is emitted only when there is new content that has been added to the page, e.g. once at page load, and also when a new widget is added or updated, etc. The first argument to your event handler will be a jQuery element which will contain only new elements.
* Legacy support for `data/port` and `data/address` files has been restored. (Note that `PORT` and `ADDRESS` environment variables supersede these. In modern Stagecoach deployments `data/port` is often a space-separated list of ports, and the `deployment/start` script parses these out and launches multiple processes with different PORT variables.)"

Workarounds for two limitations in MongoDB that impact the use of Apostrophe cursors:

* The `addLateCriteria` cursor filter has been introduced. This filter should be used only when
you need to invoke `$near` or another MongoDB operator that cannot be used within `$and`. The object
you pass to `addLateCriteria` is merged with the criteria object that is built normally by the cursor.
**Use of this filter is strongly discouraged unless you must use operators that do
not support `*$and`.**
* Custom filters that invoke `$near` or other MongoDB operators that are incompatible
with `$text` queries may call `self.set('regexSearch', true)` to force the cursor to use
a regular expression search rather than full MongoDB full-text search, if and when the
`search()` filter is called on the same cursor. This was implemented to allow combination
of full-text and geographical searches, subject of course to the limitation that regular expression
search is not indexed. It also doesn't sort by quality, but `$near` provides its own sort
by distance.

Since these are new features a minor version level bump is appropriate. However neither of these is a feature that a typical site developer will need to call directly."

* The quality of the autocomplete search results shown when selecting pages or pieces via a join was low. This has been corrected by calling the `.sort('search')` filter to sort by search result quality rather than the default sort order for the doc type manager in question.
* All of the autocomplete suggestions fit on the screen on reasonably sized displays. With the recent addition of the ""flip"" feature to push the suggestions up rather than down if the bottom of the screen would otherwise be reached, this is critical to show the first and best suggestion. Further discussion for future UX improvement in [issue 704](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe/issues/704)."

This allows you to set `scene: 'user'` if your widget or custom page will want the full set of assets on the browser side normally reserved for logged-in users, such as schemas and modals.
* Cursors for subclasses of `apostrophe-custom-pages` are now autoloaded just like cursors for pieces, however the base class is `apostrophe-pages-cursor` instead, so that `.children()` and `.after()` are available. At one point it was thought that we shouldn't offer this feature because it could mislead you into thinking your filters are available when loading the current page, but it's pretty clear that they aren't, and the ability to subclass will be critical for building experiences akin to `apostrophe-blog-2` in the future.
* Do a better job of guaranteeing that a reasonable slug is built from the title on the server side even if it has already been populated as `none`."

Implemented apostrophe-admin-bar, which provides the admin bar as a well-thought-out service and understands permissions properly. Here is what the pieces module does to register the button for each pieces subclass:

```
    self.apos.adminBar.add(self.__meta.name, self.pluralLabel, self.isAdminOnly() ? 'admin' : ('edit-' + self.name));
```

First argument: name of item (for reference when grouping them). Second: label. Third: the permission the user must have, which can be null if no permission is required other than being logged in.

Fourth: an optional `options` object, which can use an `after` property to put this item after a specific item.

This produces a data attribute on the browser side:

`data-apos-admin-bar-item=""apostrophe-events""` (for example)

On the browser side a convenience method is provided to link this to a function. Example:

```
apos.adminBar.link(self.__meta.name, function() {
  self.manage();
});
```

A module can also group items together into a dropdown:

`self.apos.group([ 'apostrophe-users', 'apostrophe-groups'])`

Or give it a special label:

`self.apos.group({ label: 'People', items: [ 'apostrophe-users', 'apostrophe-groups'] })`

But most of the time, the developer will make grouping choices:

```
modules: {
  'apostrophe-admin-bar': {
    addGroups: [
      { label: 'People', items: [ 'apostrophe-users', 'apostrophe-groups'] }
    ]
  }
}
```

(You can use `groups` instead if you don't want to keep any groups that modules suggested.)

I just wrote an epic one for Science Center, replacing the hand-written menu code that was not permissions-ready.

If the user lacks all of the permissions or is not logged in, they automatically get no admin bar at all. (Generally they will always be allowed the logout action though.)

`outerLayoutBase` now calls `apos.adminBar.output` to render this.

`logo.html` has moved to the `apostrophe-admin-bar` module.

* EASY CREATION OF BROWSER-SIDE SINGLETONS FOR ADMIN FEATURES OF MODULES

Added a `pushCreateSingleton` method to all modules. This method takes care of instantiating the browser-side singleton with the same moog type name as the module, and does it safely so you don't wind up with duplicate event handlers. It calls back to `getCreateSingletonOptions` to get the object to pass to the new singleton as `options`, which by default just contains the `self.action` property. So just override `getCreateSingletonOptions` to pass more.

This happens only if the user is logged in.

You can wait until `pageBeforeSend` and pass `req` to `pushCreateSingleton` if your options depend on exactly who the user is.

You have to actually call `pushCreateSingleton` if you want it. Not all modules need browser-side admin code. Pushing the `user.js` that defines the singleton's moog type is also up to you.

`apos.modules['full-module-name']` and `apos.moduleAlias` are automatically made available.

Many modules have their own `pushCreateSingleton` already, overriding this. It would be nice to migrate them to it. I migrated those I needed for permissions to work well.

* EASY REGISTRATION OF NEW PERMISSIONS TO BE OFFERED FOR GROUPS

If your module has a custom permission (not just the standard pieces stuff), you can call `self.apos.permissions.add({ value: 'edit-thingies', label: 'Edit the Thingies' })` and it will be available as a permission that can be assigned to groups. If you start the name with `edit-`, anyone with the `editor` permission can also automatically do it. If you don't, they must have that specific permission (or be an admin, of course)."

This makes a module available directly under a convenient name as a property of the apos object. This should NOT be used directly in npm modules as that would be poor namespacing. It will be used in core modules, and may be used freely in project-level configuration.
* Helpers have been namespaced per issue #274.
* The `module` object has been introduced in Nunjucks, providing easy access to the helpers and options of the module that invoked Nunjucks.
* The `options` property of any module may be accessed in Nunjucks.
* An `addHelpers` method has been added to the `apostrophe-module` base class. All modules now use this method to automatically register their template helpers in a namespaced way.
* `area` and `singleton` remain available directly on the `apos` object in nunjucks, all others are namespaced as described above.
* Module initialization has been cleaned up a bit, there is less need for weird little workarounds to allow base classes to see certain properties.
* Passing unit tests for all of the above."

This bug was typically reported as a minify bug but actually comes into play on any such upgrade; it's just that minify reveals it immediately at startup.

We now resend the entire CSS world on such upgrades. This is necessary because the diff we really would have to compute otherwise is on the CSS output, not the set of LESS files to be included, and that is not practical.

This is inefficient, but it only affects scene upgrades, which are fairly rare.

TODO: it would be good to remove the old stylesheets when adding the new one, note the right way involves the ""disabled"" property:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3182840/removing-or-replacing-a-stylesheet-a-link-with-javascript-jquery

However we'd have to look at whether this displays a nasty flash of unstyled content before proceeding. And we'd have to know which link elements came from our asset mechanism and leave any custom link elements alone.

We join at page rendering time instead, which makes it much easier to tell that a media item has been moved to the trash or had its global title and description and credit changed.

YOU MUST RUN node app apostrophe:migrate OR YOU WILL WONDER WHERE ALL YOUR MEDIA WENT. Our stagecoach deployment recipes do this automatically, but in dev you'll need to do it manually.

Any templates in which you are explicitly peeking at the .items property of a slideshow must now peek at ._items instead, to be consistent with our naming policy on properties that are not part of the same mongodb document. Also consider using aposAreaFindFile to avoid most of these cases.

We also made UI improvements enabled by this change. Users can decide whether to show the title, the description and the credit for every item in the slideshow, or not.

Multiple placements of the same image with different titles are therefore no longer possible. We find this is very rare and can still be done in those rare cases by uploading two copies. However note that link titles and link URLs are still per placement.

Complete notes on this transition follow:

Titles, credits and descriptions of media will be global for that media item. There will be no per-placement editing of these fields. This is consistent with A1.5.

The decision to actually show the title, credit or description will be made by the editor at the slideshow level. That is, if you choose to show titles for a slideshow, all images in that slideshow will show their global titles. No going halfsies. This is consistent with A1.5, but better in that you're not restricted to a short list of hardcoded ""variants"" of the slideshow; you get to make each choice individually in a nice UI. (We'll likely later add other options in that same UI area, like slideshow interval and the existing orientation picker.)

""Link URL"" and ""Link Title"" are still per-placement and have no global equivalent, so the ""extraFields"" option and the ""wrench"" for individual images are not going away.

Slideshows will not contain denormalized copies of media info anymore. Instead they will join on the fly with the files collection, so that they can tell if media has been moved to the trash and refuse to display it, display the media's updated title, display a replacement version of the file (soon), etc. This is consistent with A1.5. If we determine it's a performance issue we can add a more robust denormalization strategy later, with backreferences so we can figure out where the denormalized copies are and update them. There is no penalty for waiting on that.

A migration has been implemented to copy all of the appropriate information from placements to the global media objects before moving it to a backup property, legacyItems, of the media objects."

* The default permissions mechanism has been beefed up, made more consistent, implemented for both MongoDB queries affecting many documents and ad hoc inquiries about a particular object, and generally moved a long, long way down the road. You will no longer want to set the `permissions` option to your own method in most cases. See: https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-sandbox/wiki/Adding-people-and-groups-to-your-existing-project
* The apos.get method, and derivatives like snippets.get, now have separate `criteria` and `options` parameters. `criteria` is passed straight to MongoDB, typically in an $and with other criteria. `options` is the new home for custom options we implement ourselves, like the `published` option that accepts `1`, `0` or `any`, and also for options that affect the way results are returned, like `skip`, `limit` and `fields`. This means a significant change in all subclasses of snippets is needed. See: https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-sandbox/wiki/BC-break-to-apos.get,-snippets.get-and-friends
* jQuery 1.10.1, with full source (our own minifier is fine for production)
* Better support for jquery.selective"

* Added `allowed` option to areas, which limits the item types that will actually be displayed (see `controls` for how to limit what can be added in the editor). You can use a more restrictive `allowed` option to avoid displaying inappropriate widgets in excerpts. Note that rich text must be explicitly included in the list as `richText` or it will not be shown
* Added `aposAreaPlaintext` template helper, which returns a plaintext representation of an area. Note this is true plaintext, so you must escape it with the `e` filter to safely display it as part of HTML. Includes only item types that actually have an appropriate plaintext representation, which currently means richText only, although you can define a getPlaintext method for any item type (such as a widget). Includes a `truncate` option which limits the character count, avoiding word breaks if possible. The truncated text ends with a Unicode ellipsis character
* Added `apos.areaFindFile`, `apos.areaPlaintext` and `apos.truncatePlaintext` for direct access to the above functionality when not going through nunjucks
* Added `self.htmlToPlaintext`, part of the `aposAreaPlaintext` implementation which is likely to be useful separately
* Refactored `apos.partial` so that `apos.getNunjucksEnv` is broken out separately"

For this to work your site must respond differently when the apos_refresh query parameter is present, sending only the contents of the data-apos-refreshable div.

For now the only hint explains the arrows displayed before and after rich content items in the midst of the text. For now browser side cookies are used to remember which hints you've seen.
* Refactored the modal method to jot.modal where it can be leveraged for any purpose, such as hints. Modals don't currently support stacking, so you need to hide any previous modal before opening a new one.
* Code samples correctly align left when the overall widget is centered.
* Better box size for toolbar buttons.
* Clicking on a content widget now selects the entire widget including its arrows. This makes copying and pasting widgets a lot easier and also helps emphasize that they are a single unit. In general the logic for selecting an entire widget on demand has improved a lot. Works in both Firefox and Chrome.
* Undo point timer no longer breaks the focus in modals.
* Refactored pushSelection and popSelection to jot.pushSelection and jot.popSelection and made jot.modal responsible for calling them in most situations."
