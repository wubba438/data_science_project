Previously, CompositeSprites would continue to animate even when the
scene was paused.  This is because the ImageFrameProvider for each
sprite would receive the tick event and process it independently of the
Scene.  I turned this off.  Now when the Scene processes a
CompositeSprite, each sprite in the composite is given the chance to
advance its animation.  If the Scene is paused, then there is no
animation."

This fixes a bug with the CompositeSprite.  When setting the local
position of a sprite within a CompositeSprite the SpatialDirty flag
needs to be set to true for the Sprite to be redrawn at the new
position.  The occurs when the CompositeSprite is moving, rotating, or
if the CompositeSprite automatically changes size because of the sprite
relocation.  However, if the CompositeSprite is still, the inner sprite
will not be redrawn at the new location.  This change fixes that simply
by setting the SpatialDirty flag to true when the inner sprite is moved."

The WorldQuery class is responsible for finding objects in the scene
both for things like user requested picking and for handing out mouse
events.  In the second case, an assertion error was being thrown when an
object had zero area (sizeX = 0 or sizeY = 0) and the engine tried to
test it for mouse over events.  This was pointless of course because a
point cannot be inside an object with no area.  This change treats
objects without an area as invisible so they cannot be picked without
picking routine also looking for invisible objects."

This causes MoveTo to function based on position rather than time.  This
corrects problems with objects teleporting when they don't reach their
position before they are supposed to.  This was most commonly happening
because of the speed cap imposed by box2D.  The new method works the
same as before with the re-introduction of the margin as the optional
last parameter.  The new function is also more taxing on the engine
although it is unlikely that any loss in frame rate will be seen unless
hundreds of objects are being moved at the same time."

This commit no longer links to the T2D docs which frees us from a few issues:

* using ""groups"" now instead of namespaces.  cleaner docs
* special groups for Data Types (string, Vector2) and Operators (SPC), as examples
* links to ""Vector2"" and ""SPC"" for instance, now point to Vector2 inside this doc.

Note that a pseudo-code scriptBinding.h file was created to contain the data types and operators.  This is the biggest ""trick"" but it does have benefits.  On the other hand, borderline tricks from before have been removed."

- specifically, check the TAML Reference module and the Module Manager module for the engine.

To do this:
First the reference material from github wiki is brought over as a *.dox file.  doxygen understands markdown
95% well so not many tweaks are required.  By usingn a .dox file, the large reference is kept together and not
injected within a specific class.  Using the .dox is fairly standard practice.

The reference doc is placed in the dir that most closely represents it, such as module/module.dox or persistence/taml/taml.dox.

Classes in the module add themselves to their respective module with ""/// @ingroup TAMLGroup"" in the class header.

Now the markdown reference is inserted as a ""module"" and has references to all classes that are involved.

note: because the ""modules"" page in the output had lots of little groups, (such as dglThis and dglThat), I've also been pushing these groups into super groups to keep it organized (such as dglGroup which now wraps dglThis and dglThat)."
