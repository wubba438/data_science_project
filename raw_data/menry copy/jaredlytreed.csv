Amazing what a facelift can do.

New things:

- instroduced the concept of ""skins"". Base styling for views, plugins,
  contains only structural styles. the ""minimal"" skin is ugly and utilitarian,
  but usable (whereas the base styling along doesn't show anything for the
  rebase dot, for example). The ""regular"" skin is a port of the current
  notablemind theme.
- textarea-grow now finds the font size dynamically, so that it can be styled.

What's left:

- drag to move
- lots of actions on the main store, to come to parity
- tag editing. there's a fair amount to be done there
- ""edit start"" -- store.editSide?"
