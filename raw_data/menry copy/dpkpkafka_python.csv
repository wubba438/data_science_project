This makes it so the only remaining use of `unittest` is in the old
tests of the deprecated `Simple*` clients. All `KafkaConsumer` tests are
migrated to `pytest`.

I also had to bump the test iterations up on one of the tests, I think there was a race condition there that was more commonly hit under pytest , planning to cleanup that in a followup PR. See https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python/pull/1886#discussion_r316860737 for details."

Now that we are using `pytest`, there is no need for a custom decorator
because we can use `pytest.mark.skipif()`.

This makes the code significantly simpler. In particular, dropping the
custom `@kafka_versions()` decorator is necessary because it uses
`func.wraps()` which doesn't play nice with `pytest` fixtures:
- https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/677
- https://stackoverflow.com/a/19614807/770425

So this is a pre-requisite to migrating some of those tests to using
pytest fixtures."

This splits the `_find_coordinator_id()` method (which is blocking) into
request generation / response parsing methods.

The public API does not change. However, this allows power users who are
willing to deal with risk of private methods changing under their feet
to decouple generating the message futures from processing their
responses. In other words, you can use these to fire a bunch of requests
at once and delay processing the responses until all requests are fired.

This is modeled on the work done in #1845.

Additionally, I removed the code that tried to leverage the error
checking from `cluster.add_group_coordinator()`. That code had changed
in #1822, removing most of the error checking... so it no longer adds
any value, but instead merely increases complexity and coupling."

The current client attempts to bootstrap once during initialization, but if it fails there is no second attempt and the client will be inoperable. This can happen, for example, if an entire cluster is down at the time a long-running client starts execution.

This commit attempts to fix this by removing the synchronous bootstrapping from `KafkaClient` init, and instead merges bootstrap metadata with the cluster metadata. The Java client uses a similar approach. This allows us to continue falling back to bootstrap data when necessary throughout the life of a long-running consumer or producer.

Underlying issue here is a race on consumer.close() between the client, the connections/sockets, and the heartbeat thread. Although the heartbeat thread is signaled to close, we do not block for it. So when we go on to close the client and its underlying connections, if the heartbeat is still doing work it can cause errors/crashes if it attempts to access the now closed objects (selectors and/or sockets, primarily).

So this commit adds a blocking thread join to the heartbeat close. This may cause some additional blocking time on consumer.close() while the heartbeat thread finishes. But it should be small in average case and in the worst case will be no longer than the heartbeat_timeout_ms (though if we timeout the join, race errors may still occur).

Previously, this only queried the controller. In actuality, the Kafka
protocol requires that the client query all brokers in order to get the
full list of consumer groups.

Note: The Java code (as best I can tell) doesn't allow limiting this to
specific brokers. And on the surface, this makes sense... you typically
don't care about specific brokers.

However, the inverse is true... consumer groups care about knowing their
group coordinator so they don't have to repeatedly query to find it.

In fact, a Kafka broker will only return the groups that it's a
coordinator for. While this is an implementation detail that is not
guaranteed by the upstream broker code, and technically should not be
relied upon, I think it very unlikely to change.

So monitoring scripts that fetch the offsets or describe the consumers
groups of all groups in the cluster can simply issue one call per broker
to identify all the coordinators, rather than having to issue one call
per consumer group. For an ad-hoc script this doesn't matter, but for
a monitoring script that runs every couple of minutes, this can be a big
deal. I know in the situations where I will use this, this matters more
to me than the risk of the interface unexpectedly breaking."

Support fetching the offsets of a consumer group.

Note: As far as I can tell (the Java code is a little inscrutable), the
Java AdminClient doesn't allow specifying the `coordinator_id` or the
`partitions`.

But I decided to include them because they provide a lot of additional
flexibility:

1. allowing users to specify the partitions allows this method to be used even for
older brokers that don't support the OffsetFetchRequest_v2

2. allowing users to specify the coordinator ID gives them a way to
bypass a network round trip. This method will frequently be used for
monitoring, and if you've got 1,000 consumer groups that are being
monitored once a minute, that's ~1.5M requests a day that are
unnecessarily duplicated as the coordinator doesn't change unless
there's an error."

It also pinned the metadata version unnecessarily.

Additionally, several of the methods were sending to the controller

We need a way to send a request to the group coordinator.

I spent a day and a half trying to implement a `_send_request_to_group_coordinator()`
that included:
1. caching the value of the group coordinator so that it wouldn't have
to be repeatedly looked up on every call. This is particularly important
because the `list_consumer_groups()`, `list_consumer_group_offsets()`,
and `describe_consumer_groups()` will frequently be used by monitoring
scripts. I know across the production clusters that I support, using a
cached value will save ~1M calls per day.
2. clean and consistent error handling. This is difficult because the
responses are inconsistent about error codes. Some have a top-level
error code, some bury it within the description of the actual item.
3. Avoiding tight coupling between this method and the request/response
classes... the custom parsing logic for errors etc, given that it's
non-standard, should live in the callers, not here.

So finally I gave up and just went with this simpler solution and made
it so the callers can optionally bypass this if they somehow already
know the group coordinator."

semantically this seems like the appropriate error to raise. However,
this is confusing when debugging... for a real-life example, see
https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka/issues/697. So I strongly feel that
server-side errors should be kept separate from client-side errors,
even if all the client is doing is proactively protecting against
hitting a situation where the broker would return this error."

`six.moves` is a dynamically-created namespace that doesn't actually

import errors.

However, because we vendor it, the location changes to
`kafka.vendor.six.moves` so `pylint` doesn't realize it should be
ignored.

So this explicitly ignores it.

When trying to establish a connection with Kafka using SASL with the
GSSAPI authentication mechanism the connection was hanging an timing out
after 60 secons. On the Kafka broker side I noticed that the
SaslServerAuthenticator was going from the AUTHENTICATE to the FAILED state.

The GSSAPI auth implementation was missing the second handshake defined in
RFC 2222, which happens after the security context is established. This
handshake is used by the client and server to negotiate the security layer (QoP)
to be used for the connection.

Kafka currently only support the ""auth"" QoP, so the implementation in this commit
doesn't make it configurable, but this can be extended later.

With this change I was able to successfully connect to a Kerberos-enabled Kafka
broker using the SASL_PLAINTEXT protocol and the GSSAPI mechanism."

The original intent was to catch API exceptions (errors returned by the
broker when trying to produce a message) and delegate them to the
messages' futures. This is copied from the Java producer.

However, we were accidentally catching all exceptions, thereby hiding
exceptions from users unless they explicitly check the result of the
future. Much better to raise client-side errors directly in the
foreground so the user is immediately aware of them and can decide how
to handle.

kaiterramike,2017-04-24 05:24:15,https://api.github.com/repos/dpkp/kafka-python/git/commits/2a41fa1fe4cee892604786f460e916dc0d96378f,2a41fa1fe4cee892604786f460e916dc0d96378f,"Deal with brokers that disappear, reappear with different IP address (#1085)

When KafkaClient connects to a broker in _maybe_connect,
it inserts into self._conns a BrokerConnection configured
with the current host/port for that node.  The BrokerConnection
remains there forever, though, so if the broker's IP or host
ever changes, KafkaClient has no way to deal with this.

The fix is to compare the latest metadata with the current
node's connection, and if the host/IP has changed, decommission
the old connection and allow a new one to be created.

There's also a common race condition on broker startup where
the initial metadata request sometimes returns an empty list
of brokers, but subsequent requests behave normally.  So, we
must deal with broker being None here.  This change is conservative
in that it doesn't remove the connection from self._conns unless
the new broker metadata contains an entry for that same node
with a new IP/port."

Fixes mumrah/kafka-python#126

TL;DR
=====
This makes it possible to read and write snappy compressed streams that
are compatible with the java and scala kafka clients (the xerial
blocking format))

Xerial Details
==============
Kafka supports transparent compression of data (both in transit and at
rest) of messages, one of the allowable compression algorithms is
Google's snappy, an algorithm which has excellent performance at the
cost of efficiency.

The specific implementation of snappy used in kafka is the xerial-snappy
implementation, this is a readily available java library for snappy.

As part of this implementation, there is a specialised blocking format
that is somewhat none standard in the snappy world.

Xerial Format
-------------
The blocking mode of the xerial snappy library is fairly simple, using a
magic header to identify itself and then a size + block scheme, unless
otherwise noted all items in xerials blocking format are assumed to be
big-endian.

A block size (```xerial_blocksize``` in implementation) controls how
frequent the blocking occurs 32k is the default in the xerial library,
this blocking controls the size of the uncompressed chunks that will be
fed to snappy to be compressed.

The format winds up being
|   Header    | Block1 len | Block1 data  | Blockn len | Blockn data  |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
|  16 bytes   |  BE int32  | snappy bytes |  BE int32  | snappy bytes |

It is important to not that the blocksize is the amount of uncompressed
data presented to snappy at each block, whereas the blocklen is the
number of bytes that will be present in the stream, that is the
length will always be <= blocksize.

Xerial blocking header
----------------------
Marker | Magic String | Null / Pad | Version  | Compat
------ | ------------ | ---------- | -------- | --------
 byte  |   c-string   |    byte    |  int32   | int32
------ | ------------ | ---------- | -------- | --------
 -126  |   'SNAPPY'   |     \0     | variable | variable

The pad appears to be to ensure that SNAPPY is a valid cstring, and to
align the header on a word boundary.

The version is the version of this format as written by xerial, in the
wild this is currently 1 as such we only support v1.

Compat is there to claim the minimum supported version that can read a
xerial block stream, presently in the wild this is 1.

Implementation specific details
===============================
The implementation presented here follows the Xerial implementation as
of its v1 blocking format, no attempts are made to check for future
versions. Since none-xerial aware clients might have persisted snappy
compressed messages to kafka brokers we allow clients to turn on xerial
compatibility for message sending, and perform header sniffing to detect
xerial vs plain snappy payloads."

Notes:

Change MultiProcessConsumer and _mp_consume() accordingly.

Previously, when querying each partition separately, it was possible to
block waiting for messages on partition 0 even if there are new ones in partition 1.
These changes allow us to block while waiting for messages on all partitions,
and reduce total number of kafka requests.

Use Queue.Queue for single proc Queue instead of already imported
multiprocessing.Queue because the latter doesn't seem to guarantee immediate
availability of items after a put:

Adds new ConsumerFetchSizeTooSmall exception that is thrown when

continue the fetching loop while _not_ increasing the offset (basically
just retries the request with a larger fetch size)

increased while SimpleConsumer fetches from that partition"

* When you initiate a producer with a non-existant queue, the queue is
  created. However this partition info is not reflected in KafkaClient()
  immediately. So, we wait for a second and try loading it again.

  Without this fix, if we do producer.send_messages() after creating a new
  queue, the library will throw a StopIteration exception.

* In SimpleConsumer(), the defaults are not as mentioned in the comments.
  Fix this (or do we change the documentation?)

* There was a problem with the way the consumer iterator worked.
  for eg: assume that there were 10 messages in the queue/topic
  and you iterate over it as -

  for msg in consumer:
       print (msg)

  At the end of this, 'offset' that is saved is 10.
  So, if you run the above loop again, the last message (10) is repeated.

  This can be fixed by adjusting the offset counter before fetching
  the message

* Avoid some code repeat in consumer.commit()

* Fix a bug in send_offset_commit_request() invocation in consumer.py

* Fix missing imports"
