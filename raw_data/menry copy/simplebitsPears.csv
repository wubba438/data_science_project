The current link will not work if you have pears installed in a sub-folder in custom domain.

The fix is using standard wp veritable to define the path.

The copy icon is broken (if you didn't with theme name ""pear"" or when it's not installed in first level).
Therefore, i made the image path dynamically according to the theme path.
