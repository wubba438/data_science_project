ie:  You can set the mapView to allow zooms 1-20, even if your tile source can only provide 2-14.  

Limitations:
  Allowing too much overzoom results in poor images due to high magnification scaling.
  Allowing too much underzoom results in poor performance and eventually hard crashes due to memory and graphics limitations.  In general, on a 3G, you
    can only allow 1 level of underzoom.    3GS can do more.  Customize to your application, there is a friendly assert to this affect.

  Unique tilesources should no longer provide minZoom/maxZoom/tileSideLength functions as these values should come from the RMFractal projection.  Instead set custom values in the init.
  I have updated all checked in sources, but if you have your own custom source, it will need an easy tweek or two."

I need someone to code review it for me.  This does not break any existing functionality, though I'm not sure if there is a faster way to do my calculations, i KNOW that the results can't be cached though, as the origin changes frequently, as do the x,y positions.  Another set of eyes on this would be great.

Added double-tap detection code that tests and verifies the functionality of the latLngToPixel and pixelToLatLng methods.  The double-tap code can be found in the touchesEnded withEvent method in the RMMapView class.

I fixed a small math bug in the projectMercatorPoint() method in the RMMercatorToScreenProjection class where it would not properly calculate the correct pixel.x coordinate with different combinations of positive/negative mercator points.

There is only one known bug with these LatLng/Pixel translation methods.  The map does not reset the Origin.x mercator value when it loops so the conversion from latLongToPixel will return an incorrect pixel.x value if you have panned the map enough to loop the map."
