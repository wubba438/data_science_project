The enableDisableViewClip call in the fullscreen code didn't have any
effect and should have been removed when the special case for clipping
in IE and Safari fullscreen was removed in b18ef81.

The setViewDrag call claimed to disable view drag on UI state change.
The UI states are:

 init, connecting, connected, reconnecting, disconnecting, disconnected

The only state where the called function didn't immediately return was
""connected"" and that's the only state where enabling view drag is
possible. Thus it could never have been enabled when changing to the
""connected"" state."

This only reads from localstorage in order to initialize the settings
map.  After initializaton, reads will return the value from the map.

When writing a value, the settings map and the local storage
are updated, unless the setting is a default value or derived from
the query string.

This has a few advantages:
 1. Saved settings will not be overridden by settings specified in
the query string.  This means a setting could be temporarily changed
using the query string, but once removed from the query string, the
setting would return back to what the user selected.
 2. Default values will not be saved.  If a user has always used
the default value for a setting, then they can move to a new version
with different defaults without clearing localstorage.
 3. Changes made to localstorage in a session running in a different
window will not affect the settings in the current window (until
the page is refreshed).

Regarding eraseSetting:

It is possible that another tab could change the value, leading
to an unexpected value change in the tab that deletes.  However,
this function is currently unused, so this will be evaluted if
and when it used."

The API allowed strings to be passed from the RFB module to the
application using the disconnect reason. This caused problems since
the application didn't have control over translations for these
strings.

Most of the information being passed using this string was very
technical and not helpful to the end user. One exception to this was
the security result information regarding for example authentication
failures. The protocol allows the VNC server to pass a string
directly to the user in the security result.

So the disconnect reason is replaced by a boolean saying if the
disconnection was clean or not. And for the security result information
from the server, a new event has been added."

A previous commit started (quasi-correctly) rewriting vendor import
paths on built files.  The gist of it was correct, but it incorrectly
rewrote paths in vendor itself.

The babel plugin in use operated on canonical absolute paths.  This mean
that it saw no difference between the import
`../vendor/pako/lib/utils/foo` and `../utils/foo`, where the later was
actually in the `vendor/pako/lib/bar` directory.  This rewrote imports
in files in the vendor directory itself.  However, since those files
were *already* in the correct relative location, the new import was
incorrect by a degree of `..`.

Now, we only rewrite vendor paths on things in the `core` directory."

This patch looks at the delta of wheel events and doesn't send events
until the combined delta has passed a threshold. Single events that
doesn't pass the threshold get sent after a timeout in order to not
loose any events.

Fixes #577."

is against the recommendations in libvncserver/tight.c due to excessive

LTS) to prefer the blurry JPEG compression too much - e.g. red text on
the default background in MATE terminal becomes almost unreadable.

The new default is the recommended compression level for low-color
workloads, according to libvncserver source. Also, it is the maximum
compression level that doesn't trigger the Vino bug with red text in

QEMU RFB extension

Fixes #21 🎉 (again)"
danielhb,2016-04-11 10:11:43,https://api.github.com/repos/novnc/noVNC/git/commits/49637e432e8331ef9775583345be23903ef3e633,49637e432e8331ef9775583345be23903ef3e633,"QEMU RFB extension - keyboard.js changes

Added a 'QEMUKeyEventDecoder' method to deal with the
key events generated when the QEMU extension is active. Another
method, 'TrackQEMUKeyState', was also created with this same
goal.

Although both methods have similaries with the existing methods
'KeyEventDecoder' and 'TrackKeyState', specially when dealing
with 'supress' and 'releaseall', the logic behind the QEMU extension
does not required keysym generation for most cases (some NumPad keys
are an exception) and, as such, there is no need to treat 'keyPressed'
events and to handle char modifiers.

'TrackQEMUKeyState' also handles a Windows scenario where the
'AltGR' key generates CtrlLeft and AltRight keystrokes. The solution
was to avoid this specific combination to be sent to the VNC server,
discarding the extra 'CtrlLeft' key. Considering that the user can
send CtrlLeft+AltLeft, CtrlRight+AltRight and even CtrlRight+AltLeft,
this workaround to allow Windows users to use AltGR in their noVNC
sessions is worthwhile.

In input.js, a new keyboard handler was added to deal exclusively
with the QEMU key event extension. '_onKeyPress()' signature
was changed to allow the same method to treat both cases.

The extension will only be enabled if the browser has support
for the KeyboardEvent.code property.

Changes in rfb.js:

- added a new extension code, QEMUExtendedKeyEvent, value -258.

- handleKeyPress now receives 'keyevent' instead of 'keysym' and
'down'. Both values are retrieved from keyevent as they were
in the previous signature. This method now can send QEMU RFB
extended key messages if the flag was set to 'true'.

- tests/test.rfb.js were changed folowing the onKeyPress() signature
change.

- added a new function to send the QEMU extended key message.

For performance reasons, the `handle_tight` function skips the
use of the receive queue API and uses the raw receive queue directly.
Because of the way that typed array receive queue gets reused, this
introduced the potential for buffer over-reads.

To address this, a new function, `rQwhole`, was introduced.
`rQwhole` simply returns a new view into the receive queue that
starts at 0 and ends at the current recorded end of the queue.

`handle_tight` now makes use of this function.

- Inline `getTightCLength`, which returned a two-item array.

**This commit removes Base64 (and Flash) support**

This commit converts websock.js to used Typed Arrays for the
receive queue (and tweaks rfb.js to ensure that it continues
to function, since only Firefox implements
`%TypedArray%.prototype.slice`).  Base64 support was removed
to simplify code paths, and pave the way for using Typed Arrays
for the send queue as well.

This provides two advantages: first, we allocate a buffer ahead
of time, meaning the browser doesn't have to do any work dynamically
increasing the receive queue size.  Secondly, we are now able to pass
around Typed Array Views (e.g. `Uint8Array`), which are lightweight, and
don't involve copying.

The downside is that we initially allocate more memory -- we currently
start out with 4 MiB, and then automatically double when it looks like
the amount unused is getting to small.

The commit also explicitly adds a check to the compacting logic that
avoids calling the copy functions if `_rQlen === _rQi`."

Previously, if an error was thrown from the Display constructor
in the RFB constructor, we would attempt to use `RFB#updateState`

the WebSocket connection, which doesn't exist at this point.

In the constructor, it's probably just better to raise an exception
instead (making sure to clean up anything relevant).

In e543525faa9cf0d683f41e183e89cd909f3dd229, we switched to creating

any errors were only displayed briefly before the new ""loaded"" text
was displayed instead.

Now, we create the RFB object on connect.  This essentially removes
the usefulness of the ""loaded"" state, but prevents the aforementioned
problem.

To facilitate this, the code which does detection of cursor URI support
was moved from this Display constructor (which now calls the new
function) into its own function, `Util.browserSupportsCursorURIs()`.

Otherwise, check to see if websockify is installed somewhere (try
`which websockify`).  If it is, use that.  Otherwise, clone

File: util.js
Tests Added: True (partial -- for logging and array push methods)
Changes:
- Fixed JSHint Errors (indentation, semicolons, global ""use strict"")
- Made browser detection methods more readable
- added some newline characters when appropriate for readability
- throw Errors not strings!
- Removed conf_defaults, and added make_properties and set_defaults
  instead (see below)

The removal of conf_defaults and switch to make_properties and
set_defaults is to facilitate the switch over to normal Javascript
constructors instead of Crockford-style constructors.  Now, methods
are added to the objects prototype (and thus make properties is called
outside the constructor)."

proper `module.exports` declarations.  Additionally,
some of the code is dependent on having a browser
environment.

To overcome these issues, a headless browser environment
is used.  The command file introduced in the commit,
`run_from_console.js`, can use one of two environments:
ZombieJS, a pure-javascript headless browser simulator, or
SpookyJS/CasperJS/PhantomJS, an actually WebKit-based
environment.

Because the environment-dependent code is separated
out in to different files ('run_from_console.zombie.js'
and 'run_from_console.casper.js'), the program can be
safely used if only one of the supported environments
is installed.

Additionally, the command will automatically generate
HTML and inject the required tests if there is no
pre-existing HTML file (although you can still use
pre-existing HTML files if you want to).

The required NPM modules for the base program are:

- commander
- ansi
- mocha (must be installed locally for the HTML files to use)
- chai (must be installed locally for the HTML files to use)
- temp

For Zombie, you need:

- zombie
- q

For Casper, you need:

- casperjs (must be installed locally in order to work properly)
- phantomjs
- phantom
- spooky

The command itself can be invoked as

   $ node run_from_console.js -t html_files

or

   $ node run_from_console.js -t js_test_files -i js_required_files

In both cases, the 'files' options should be a comma-separated list of
files.  The first case runs pre-existing HTML files.  The second case
generates HTML files to run the specified Mocha tests, and injects
the requirements specified as well.

Additionally, there are extra arguments that apply to both forms:
'-a' can be used to print all test results, not just the failures,
'-c' may be used to force color to be enabled (when outputting to
a pipe, such as when `less -R` is in use), and '-e' is used to
set the environment.  Use the '-h' or '--help' options to see
a detailed description of all options, and their long-form versions."

https://github.com/kanaka/noVNC/pull/202

In IE9, the window.onload event can fire before dynamically loaded
scripts have finished loading. This can result in either WebSocket (in
the case of vnc_auto.html) or RFB (in the case of vnc.html) not being
defined at the point when window.onload is called.

- Move the load_scripts routine from vnc.js to util.js (so that
  websockify can use it too). Also, refactor to work when load_scripts
  is called by a script that itself uses load_scripts. When the whole
  chain of dynamically loaded scripts is finished then call
  window.onscriptsload. Use this mechanism in all the places that
  depend on dynamic loading of scripts: vnc.html, vnc_auto.html,
  websock.js, tests/vnc_playback.html, and tests/vnc_perf.html.

- Use the new window.onscriptsload handler instead of window.onload.

- Remove include/start.js and do the script loading and startup event
  handling in include/ui.js instead."

The MPL 2.0 license is a ""file-level"" copyleft license vs the
""project-level"" nature of the L/GPL. The intention of noVNC has
always been that it should be easy to incorporate into existing
projects and sites whether free/open or proprietary/commercial. The MPL
2.0 is designed for this sort of combination project but still
requires that any distributed modifications to noVNC source files must
also be published under the same license.

In addition, the MPL 2.0 allows the code to be used in L/GPL projects
(the secondary license clause). This means that any projects that are
already incorporating noVNC should not be impacted by this change and
in fact it should clarify the licensing situation (the exact
application of the L/GPL to web applications and interpreted code is
somewhat ambiguous).

The HTML, CSS, image and font files continue to be under more
permissive licenses (see LICENSE.txt). The included websockify python
code remains under a LGPLv3 license although the include/websock.js
file from the websockify component is now under MPL 2.0 as well.

Permission was received from other noVNC authors to make this change to their
code license on the following dates:

The imgQ code in RFB should be a generic rendering queue system in
Display.

The reason for the render queue in the first place is that images
loaded from raw data URI strings aren't immediately ready to display
so we have to wait for them to complete 'loading'. However, when data
URI images are mixed with other types of rendering actions then things
can get out of order. This is the reason for the rendering queue.

Currently this only keeps display actions for tight and tightPNG
related actions in order (because they use a mix of fills, raw pixel
data and data URI images)."

May window managers have a keyboard shortcut that switch away from the
current desktop (e.g. desktop switcher). Unfortunately, when this
happens, the meta/control keys that are used with the shortcut will
send a down event to the browser, but the up event will never be sent
because the browser no longer has focus at the point when the up event
happens. This can cause weird stuck key issues for VNC clients (not
just noVNC). To get around this, we try and detect when the browser
loses focus and release any keys that are on the keyDownList.

As an aside, if you run into this situation (in noVNC or another VNC
client), you can unstick the state by pressing and releasing the Ctrl,
Shift, Alt, etc.

Display API change:
    - getTile -> startTile (no longer returns a tile)
    - setSubTile -> subTile (drop img/tile first parameter)

The Display tile logic uses canvas image data directly and
caches/reuses a 16x16 imageData tile (for other sizes, the tile is
create for each call). This gives a 30% speedup on Chrome
13 (and no significant change for Firefox 3.6/4.0).

- Remove rgbxImageFill and cmapImageFill routines.

- Simplify constructor tests and just error if createImageData is not
  supported by canvas instead of .

- Remove webkit canvas bug workaround that effects Chrome 7. Chrome
  7 usage share is now less than 0.5 percent and the workaround is
  ugly. Drop the function wrapping in the constructor and the canvas
  flush() routine.

Part of mobile device support:
https://github.com/kanaka/noVNC/issues/48

The Display object is redefined as a larger display region with
an equal or smaller visible viewport. The size of the full display
region is set/changed using resize(). The viewport is set/changed
using viewportChange().

All exposed routines that draw on the display now take coordinates
that are absolute (relative to the full display region). For example,
the result of fillRect(100, 100, 10, 10, [255,0,0]) will appear in the
canvas at (0,0) if the viewport is set to (100,100).

Details:

- Move the generic part of the viewport code from tests/viewport.html
  into include/display.

- Add two new routines to the Display interface:

    - viewportChange(deltaX, deltaY, width, height)
        - This adjusts the position of the visible viewport and/or the
          size of the viewport.

        - deltaX and deltaY specify how the position of the viewport
          should be shifted. The position of the viewport is clamped
          to the full region size (i.e. cannot outside the display
          region).

        - The clean and dirty regions of the display are updated based
          on calls to this routine. For example, if the viewport width
          is increased, then there is now a dirty box on the right
          side of the viewport. Another example, if the viewport is
          shifted down and to the left over the display region, there
          are now two dirty boxes: one on the left side and one
          on the bottom of the viewport.

    - getCleanDirtyReset()
        - This returns an object with the clean box and a list of
          dirty boxes (that need to be redrawn).

            {'cleanBox':
                {'x': x, 'y': y, 'w': w, 'h': h},
             'dirtyBoxes':
                [{'x': x, 'y': y, 'w': w, 'h': h}, ...]
             }

        - The coordinates in the clean and dirty boxes are absolute
          coordinates (relative to the full display region) but they
          are clipped to the visible viewport.

        - Calling this function also resets the clean rectangle to be
          the whole viewport (i.e. nothing visible needs to be redrawn
          dirty) so the caller of this routine is responsible for
          redrawing any"

This is part of addressing issue #21 - non-US keyboard layouts.

There are several challenges when dealing with keyboard events:
  - The meaning and use of keyCode, charCode and which depends on
    both the browser and the event type (keyDown/Up vs keyPress).
  - We cannot automatically determine the keyboard layout
  - The keyDown and keyUp events have a keyCode value that has not
    been translated by modifier keys.
  - The keyPress event has a translated (for layout and modifiers)
    character code but the attribute containing it differs. keyCode
    contains the translated value in WebKit (Chrome/Safari), Opera
    11 and IE9. charCode contains the value in WebKit and Firefox.
    The which attribute contains the value on WebKit, Firefox and
    Opera 11.
  - The keyDown/Up keyCode value indicates (sort of) the physical
    key was pressed but only for standard US layout. On a US
    keyboard, the '-' and '_' characters are on the same key and
    generate a keyCode value of 189. But on an AZERTY keyboard even
    though they are different physical keys they both still
    generate a keyCode of 189!
  - To prevent a key event from propagating to the browser and
    causing unwanted default actions (such as closing a tab,
    opening a menu, shifting focus, etc) we must suppress this
    event in both keyDown and keyPress because not all key strokes
    generate on a keyPress event. Also, in WebKit and IE9
    suppressing the keyDown prevents a keyPress but other browsers
    still generated a keyPress even if keyDown is suppressed.

For safe key events, we wait until the keyPress event before
reporting a key down event. For unsafe key events, we report a key
down event when the keyDown event fires and we suppress any further
actions (including keyPress).

In order to report a key up event that matches what we reported
for the key down event, we keep a list of keys that are currently
down. When the keyDown event happens, we add the key event to the
list. If it is a safe key event, then we update the which attribute
in the most recent item on the list when we received a keyPress
event (keyPress should immediately follow keyDown). When we
received a keyUp event we search for the event on the list with
a matching keyCode and we report the character code using the value
in the 'which' attribute that was stored with that key.

For character codes above 255 we use a character code to keysym lookup
table. This is generated using the util/u2x11 script contributed by
Colin Dean (xvpsource.org)."

wswrapper:

    Getting the wswrapper.c LD_PRELOAD model working has turned out to
    involve too many dark corners of the glibc/POSIX file descriptor
    space. I realized that 95% of what I want can be accomplished by
    adding a ""wrap command"" mode to wsproxy.

    The code is still there for now, but consider it experimental at
    best. Minor fix to dup2 and add dup and dup3 logging.

wsproxy Wrap Command:

    In wsproxy wrap command mode, a command line is specified instead
    of a target address and port. wsproxy then uses a much simpler
    LD_PRELOAD library, rebind.so, to move intercept any bind() system
    calls made by the program. If the bind() call is for the wsproxy
    listen port number then the real bind() system call is issued for
    an alternate (free high) port on loopback/localhost.  wsproxy then
    forwards from the listen address/port to the moved port.

    The --wrap-mode argument takes three options that determine the
    behavior of wsproxy when the wrapped command returns an exit code
    (exit or daemonizing): ignore, exit, respawn.

    For example, this runs vncserver on turns port 5901 into
    a WebSockets port (rebind.so must be built first):

        ./utils/wsproxy.py --wrap-mode=ignore 5901 -- vncserver :1

    The vncserver command backgrounds itself so the wrap mode is set
    to ""ignore"" so that wsproxy keeps running even after it receives
    an exit code from vncserver.

wstelnet:

    To demonstrate the wrap command mode, I added WebSockets telnet
    client.

    For example, this runs telnetd (krb5-telnetd) on turns port 2023
    into a WebSockets port (using ""respawn"" mode since telnetd exits
    after each connection closes):

        sudo ./utils/wsproxy.py --wrap-mode=respawn 2023 -- telnetd -debug 2023

    Then the utils/wstelnet.html page can be used to connect to the
    telnetd server on port 2023. The telnet client includes VT100.js
    (from http://code.google.com/p/sshconsole) which handles the
    terminal emulation and rendering.

rebind:

    The rebind LD_PRELOAD library is used by wsproxy in wrap command
    mode to intercept bind() system calls and move the port to
    a different port on loopback/localhost. The rebind.so library can
    be built by running make in the utils directory.

    The rebind library can be used separately from wsproxy by setting
    the REBIND_OLD_PORT and REBIND_NEW_PORT environment variables
    prior to executing a command. For example:

        export export REBIND_PORT_OLD=""23""
        export export REBIND_PORT_NEW=""65023""
        LD_PRELOAD=./rebind.so telnetd -debug 23

    Alternately, the rebind script does the same thing:

        rebind 23 65023 telnetd -debug 23

Other changes/notes:

- wsproxy no longer daemonizes by default. Remove -f/--foreground
  option and add -D/--deamon option.

- When wsproxy is used to wrap a command in ""respawn"" mode, the
  command will not be respawn more often than 3 times within 10
  seconds.

- Move getKeysym routine out of Canvas object so that it can be called
  directly."

Moved websocket.py code into a class WebSocketServer. WebSockets
server implementations will sub-class and define a handler() method
which is passed the client socket after. Global variable settings have been
changed to be parameters for WebSocketServer when created.

Subclass implementations still have to handle queueing and sending but
the parent class handles everything else (daemonizing, websocket
handshake, encode/decode, etc). It would be better if the parent class
could handle queueing and sending. This adds some buffering and
polling complexity to the parent class but it would be better to do so
at some point. However, the result is still much cleaner as can be
seen in wsecho.py.

Refactored wsproxy.py and wstest.py (formerly ws.py) to use the new
class. Added wsecho.py as a simple echo server.

- rename tests/ws.py to utils/wstest.py and add a symlink from
  tests/wstest.py

- rename tests/ws.html to tests/wstest.html to match utils/wstest.py.

- add utils/wsecho.py

This is WebKit bug https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46319

The workaround is to wrap Canvas render functions with a function that
sets a flush timer. The flush function sets the right margin and then
1ms later sets it back. This triggers the canvas to redraw with the
correct contents.

Two downsides:
- rendering is slower, but only on the busted versions of webkit.
  Correct and useful is better than fast and useless.
- There is a barely perceptible jitter of the control buttons because
  the canvas size is changing by one pixel.

To support this functionality, we also have to read out the exact
webkit version from the user agent in the render engine detection code
in include/util.js."

Addresses this issue:
http://github.com/kanaka/noVNC/issues#issue/14

Safari starts with '\x80' rather than '\x16' like Chrome and Firefox
and having PROTOCOL_TLSv1 doesn't work with Safari. But just removing
the ssl_version allows things to work with Safari wss:// connections.

Also, if the handshake (after SSL wrapping) is null then terminate the
connection. This probably means the certificate was refused by the
client. Unfortunately Safari (the version I have) doesn't cleanly
shutdown WebSockets connections until the page is reloaded (even if
the object is no longer referenced)."

Right now the close() call only calls __flash.close() if readyState is OPEN.
But it should really call close any time that readyState is not CLOSED or
CLOSING.

The case I ran into is when I want to do the following:
1. make a test connection
2. tell the server to setup for a connection
3. connect again

I call close on the test connection, but since it is ignored when CONNECTING,
it eventually times out with a error. But by that time I have already issued a
new connection, it causes the new connection to fail. close() should cancel
CONNECTING state too."

Filed this bug about this issue:
http://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js/issues#issue/35

To work around the flash ""recursive call"" problem, WebSocket.as has
the onclose event disabled in the close() call and the javascript half
of the close() call does the onclose() call instead. This is fine, but
it needs to be asynchronous to act more like what happens with
a normal WebSockets object. The current behavior is that the onclose()
method is called inline (synchronously) when the close() is called and
this inconsistency make state handling more difficult."

New API:

To use the RFB object, you now must instantiate it (this allows more
than one instance of it on the same page).

    rfb = new RFB(settings);

The 'settings' variable is a namespace that contains initial default
settings. These can also be set and read using 'rfb.set_FOO()' and
'rfb.get_FOO()' where FOO is the setting name. The current settings
are (and defaults) are:
    - target: the DOM Canvas element to use ('VNC_canvas').
    - encrypt: whether to encrypt the connection (false)
    - true_color: true_color or palette (true)
    - b64encode: base64 encode the WebSockets data (true)
    - local_cursor: use local cursor rendering (true if supported)
    - connectTimeout: milliseconds to wait for connect (2000)
    - updateState: callback when RFB state changes (none)
    - clipboardReceive: callback when clipboard data received (none)

The parameters to the updateState callback have also changed. The
function spec is now updateState(rfb, state, oldstate, msg):
    - rfb: the RFB object that this state change is for.
    - state: the new state
    - oldstate: the previous state
    - msg: a message associate with the state (not always set).

The clipboardReceive spec is clipboardReceive(rfb, text):
    - rfb: the RFB object that this text is from.
    - text: the clipboard text received.

Changes:

- The RFB and Canvas namespaces are now more proper objects. Private
  implementation is no longer exposed and the public API has been made
  explicit. Also, instantiation allows more than one VNC connection
  on the same page (to complete this, DefaultControls will also need
  this same refactoring).

- Added 'none' logging level.

- Removed automatic stylesheet selection workaround in util.js and
  move it to defaultcontrols so that it doesn't interfere with
  intergration.

- Also, some major JSLinting.

- Fix input, canvas, and cursor tests to work with new model."

The following API changes may affect integrators:

    - Settings have been moved out of the RFB.connect() call. Each
      setting now has it's own setter function: setEncrypt, setBase64,
      setTrueColor, setCursor.

    - Encrypt and cursor settings now default to on.

    - CSS changes:
        - VNC_status_bar for input buttons switched to a element class.

        - VNC_buttons split into VNC_buttons_right and
          VNC_buttons_left

        - New id styles for VNC_settings_menu and VNC_setting

Note: the encrypt, true_color and cursor, logging setting can all be
  set on load using query string variables (in addition to host, port
  and password).

Client cursor (cursor pseudo-encoding) support has been polished and
activated.

The RFB settings are now presented as radio button list items in
a drop-down ""Settings"" menu when using the default controls.

Also, in the settings menu is the ability to select between alternate
style-sheets.

Cookie and stylesheet selection support added to util.js."

When using web-socket-js, the onopen event may happen inline so the
caller may not have time to set onopen before the event fires. In this
case set a short timeout and try again. In particular this affects
Opera most of the time.

Also, to get around Opera event droppings, always read the readyState
directly instead of relying on the local readyState variable to be
correct (which it isn't if stateChange event were dropped)."

Instead of relying on FABridge AS -> JS event delivery, we just use
the events to notify JS of pending data. The message handler then
calls the AS readSocketData routine which sends back an array of
the pending WebSocket frames.

There is still a minor bug somewhere that happens after the first
connect where the web-socket-js throws an ""INVALID_STATE_ERR: Web
Socket connection has not been established"". But, Opera is now usable
and we should be able to drop the packet sequence numbering and
re-ordering code.

Another minor issue to better support Opera is to move JS script

On the client side, this adds the as3crypto library to web-socket-js
so that the WebSocket 'wss://' scheme is supported which is WebSocket
over SSL/TLS.

Couple of downsides to the fall-back method:

    - This balloons the size of the web-socket-js object from about 12K to 172K.

    - Getting it working required disabling RFC2718 web proxy support
      in web-socket-js.

    - It makes the web-socket-js fallback even slower with the
      encryption overhead.

The server side (wsproxy.py) uses python SSL support. The proxy
automatically detects the type of incoming connection whether flash
policy request, SSL/TLS handshake ('wss://') or plain socket
('ws://').

Also added a check-box to the web page to enable/disabled 'wss://'

Lame. Opera doesn't support javascript reduce().
