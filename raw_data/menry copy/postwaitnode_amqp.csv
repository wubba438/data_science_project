Issue #230 was caused by a colleciton between net.Socket.connect and Connection.connect.

Rather than proxy all methods directly into Connection and defining getters and setters,
this patch instead proxies the methods that would likely be used but keeps the socket itself
on `connection.socket`. We simply proxy events from the socket to the EventEmitter on the
connection itself.

This eliminates the slow getter/setter proxying, the confusion surrounding name collisions,
and eliminates the need to rebind handlers on reconnect."

A previous fix changed handling of 'longlong' to use a Buffer instead of a Number, since a Number overflows
at 2^53. It used the same code for Timestamps as well, as they are defined as 64 bit. However, timestamps
(from javascript) are usually passed as Number objects and the serializer/parser expected a buffer, which sent
zeroes.

Timestamp is now parsed & serialized as a Number. 'longlong' is still parsed & serialized as as Buffer, as it
should be expected that if you need this, you know how about javascript's Number type."

from _unAcked table.

We were unable to get `publish` methods to return callbacks. Examination
of the code revealed that the `deliveryTag` is returned as a buffer,
while the `_unAcked` table is keyed by a string representing
`_sequence`. This caused `_unAcked` callbacks to be unretrievable when
the publication event was acknowledged.

The ""fix"" in this code at least identifies the error. The approach is to
read the last 4 bytes of the buffer. Note that the buffer is 8 bytes,
meaning we are ignoring the first 4 bytes. However, this is seeded with
the `_sequence` value (an integer) at send time, and therefore will
never be larger than 4 bytes anyway."
