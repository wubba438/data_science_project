Fish completes parts of words split by the separators, so things like
`dd if=/dev/sd<TAB>` work.
This commit improves interactive completion if completion strings legitimately
contain '=' or ':'.  Consider this example where completion will suggest
a:a:1 and other files in the cwd in addition to a:1

touch a:1; complete -C'ls a:'

This behavior remains unchanged, but this commit allows to quote or escape
separators, so that e.g. `ls ""a:<TAB>` and `ls a\:<TAB>` successfully complete
the filename.

This also makes the completion insert those escapes automatically unless
already quoted.
So `ls a<TAB>` will give `ls a\:1`.

Both changes match bash's behavior."

Previously, elements already existing in the path variable would keep their position when the path was being constructed from the config files. This caused issues given that $PATH typically already contains ""/usr/bin:/bin"" when fish initializes within a macOS terminal app. In this case, these would keep their position at the front of the $PATH, even though the system path_helper configs explicitly place them _after_ other paths, like ""/usr/local/bin"". This would render binaries in ""/usr/local/bin"" as effectively ""invisible"" if they also happen to live in ""/usr/bin"" as well. This is not the intended

This change makes the __fish_macos_set_env config function emulate the macOS standard path_helper behavior more faithfully, with:

1. The path list being constructed *from scratch* based on the paths specified in the config files
2. Any distinct entries in the exist path environment variable being appended to this list
3. And then this list being used to *replace* the existing path environment variable

The result, for a vanilla fish shell on macOS, is that the $PATH is now set to:

    /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin

Where previously it was set to:

    /usr/bin /bin /usr/local/bin /usr/sbin /sbin

This new $PATH exactly matches the order of paths specified in `/etc/paths`."

When executing a job, if the first process is fish internal, then have
fish claim the job's pgroup.

The idea here is that the terminal must be owned by a pgroup containing
the process reading from the terminal. If the first process is fish
internal (a function or builtin) then the pgroup must contain the fish
process.

This is a bit of a workaround of the behavior where the first process that
executes in a job becomes the process group leader. If there's a deferred
process, then we will execute processes out of order so the pgroup can be
wrong. Fix this by setting the process group leader explicitly as fish
when necessary.

This fixes a race condition in the topic monitor. A thread may decide to
enter the wait queue, but before it does the generation list changes, and
so our thread will wait forever, resulting in a hang.

It also simplifies the implementation of the topic monitor considerably;
on reflection the whole ""metagen"" thing isn't providing any value and we
should just compare generations directly.

In the new design, we have a lock-protected list of current generations,
along with a boolean as to whether someone is reading from the pipe. The

Brace expansion with single words in it is quite useless - `HEAD@{0}`
expanding to `HEAD@0` breaks git.

So we complicate the rule slightly - if there is no variable expansion

Note that this is technically backwards-incompatible, because

    echo foo{0}

will now print `foo{0}` instead of `foo0`. However that's a
technicality because the braces were literally useless in that case.

Our tests needed to be adjusted, but that's because they are meant to

wcwidth for *every* character.

So instead we don't do that. If we find the mismatch, we check if it's

incorrectly used c_iflag instead of c_oflag, and I copied that error
in my patch.  Fixed that. However, there seems to be other problems
trying to use ""\x1B[A"", which I have not tried to debug, so comment that out.

somebody starts a different terminal from tmux.

We drop the `tput` since it is useless (like terminfo in general for
feature-detection, because everyone claims to be xterm).

So we just check if we are in konsole, iTerm, vte or genuine-xterm.

This is a long-standing issue with how `complete --do-complete` does
its argument parsing: It takes an optional argument, so it has to be
attached to the token like `complete --do-complete=foo` or (worse)
`complete -Cfoo`.

But since `complete` doesn't take any bare arguments otherwise (it
would error with ""too many arguments"" if you did `complete -C foo`) we
can just take one free argument as the argument to `--do-complete`.

It's more of a command than an option anyway, since it entirely
changes what the `complete` call _does_."

This change was unsafe. The prior version (now restored) took the lock and
then copied the data. By returning a reference, the caller holds a
reference to data outside of the lock.

This function isn't worth optimizing. Hardly any functions use this
facility, and for those that do, they typically just capture one or two

have another pgrp) to receive SIGTTIN / SIGTTOU.

Only reclaim the foreground pgrp if it was held at the point of job_continue.

This set the term modes to the shell-modes, including disabling
ICRNL (translating \cm to \cj) and echo.

The rationale given was that `reader_interactive_init()` would only be
called >= 250ms later, which I _highly_ doubt considering fish's total
startup time is 8ms for me.

The main idea was that this would stop programs like tmuxinator that
send shortcuts early from failing _iff_ the shortcut was \cj, which
also seems quite unusual.

This works both with `rm -i` and `read` in config.fish, because `read`
explicitly calls `reader_push`, which then initializes the shell modes.

The real fix would involve reordering our init so we set up the
modesetting first, but that's quite involved and the remaining issue
should barely happen, while it's fairly common to have issues with a
prompt in config.fish, and the workaround for the former is simpler, so let's leave it for now.

The data stored in these containers is small enough that it is worth
creating distinct sets for each lookup.

In a microbenchmark of these changes, the single-lookup version of the
function with lookups gated on the length of input (bypassed entirely if
the input is longer than the longest key in the container) provided a
1.5x-3.5x speedup over the previous implementation.

Additionally, as the collections are static and their contents are never
modified after startup, it makes no sense to continously calculate the
location of and allocate an iterator for the `!= foo.end()` comparison;
the end iterator is now statically cached.

I'm not expecting massive speed gains out of this change, but the parser
does perform enough of these to make it worth optimizing in this way."

when a test fails was always reversed, because the diff tool is called
with `${difftool} ${new} ${old}` so all the `-` and `+` contexts are
reversed, and the highlights are all screwed up.

The output of a `make test` run should show what has changed from the
baseline/expected, not how the expected differs from the actual. When
considered from both the perspective of intentional changes to the test
outputs and failed test outputs, it is desirable to see how the test
output has changed from the previously expected, and not the other way
around.

This merges a bunch of changes that clean up how the reader loop and input

Prior to this fix, we abused wchar_t by cramming readline functions into
""private"" regions. Readline functions then were further abused with
meta-readline functions like R_NULL or R_TIMEOUT.

This fix introduces a new type char_event_type_t which wraps up the ""meta""
character types. A char event may be a null (try again), timeout, readline,
or real input character. These are all distinct values.

The reader loop is then refactored to handle these cases separately."

The system version of `wcwidth()` reflects the capabilities of the
system's own virtual terminal's view of the width of the character in

smart for most login terminals, which generally barely support anything
beyond ASCII text.

console rather than within a terminal emulator running in a desktop

If you use these to figure out if there _are_ staged files, or dirty

the configured character.

Instead, we let them also return a useful status.
Notably, this is *not* simply the status of the git call.

__fish_git_prompt_X returns 0 if the repo is X.

This works for untracked, but the ""diff"" things return 1 if there is a
diff, so we invert the status for them.

POSIX dictates here that incomplete conversions, like in

causing the error to be printed _after_, like

Currently, to add a backslash to an a or b (to ""escape"" it):

7 backslashes!

This removes one of the layers, so now 3 or 4 works (each one escaped
for the single-quotes, so pcre receives two, which it reads as one literal):

    string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\$1' a

think and that's the way it's supposed to work.

system wcwidth says to ""😃"", U+1F603 ""Grinning Face With Big Eyes"".

The intention is to, in most cases, make setting $fish_emoji_width
unnecessary, but since it sets the ""guessed_emoji_width"", that variable still takes precedence if it is set.

Unfortunately this approach has some caveats:

- It relies on the locale being set to a unicode-supporting one.
  (C.UTF-8 is unfortunately not standard, so we can't use it)
- It relies on the terminal's wcwidth having unicode9 support IFF the
  system wcwidth does.

This is like #5722, but at runtime.

The additional caveat is that we don't try to achieve a unicode
locale, but since we re-run the heuristic when the locale changes (and
we try to get a unicode locale), we should still often get the correct
value.

Plus if you use a C locale and your terminal still displays emoji,
you've misconfigured your system.

Fixes #5722."

`ipset list --name` is a privileged operation, and it prints an

What's worse, this did it on loading (the command substitution wasn't
quoted), so we'd print the error as soon as you did `ipset `.

Only do the operation when necessary, and don't print the error.

This'll effectively only make it work for root shells (not e.g. `sudo
ipset`), but I don't want to sprinkle `sudo` in the completion.

(Also why does listing stuff require root? That's not how it works
e.g. for ips. But I don't actually know what ipset is for, so maybe
there is a good reason.)

It turns out that `string split0` didn't actually ever do any
splitting. The arg_iterator_t already split stdin on NUL, and split0 just
performed an additional search that could never succeed (since
arguments from argv already can't contain NUL).

Let the arg_iterator_t not perform any splitting if asked, and then
let split0 split in 0.

One slight wart is that split0 ignores a trailing NUL, which normal
split doesn't.

Fixes #5701."

usually do not show up in ~/.config - they're in ~/.local/share.

The sigchld generation expresses the idea that, if we receive a sigchld

This is a big change to how process reaping works, reimplenting it using
topics. The idea is to simplify the logic in
process_mark_finished_children around blocking, and also prepare for

Before this change, fish would use waitpid() to wait for a process group,
OR would individually poll processes if the process group leader was
unreapable.

After this change, fish no longer ever calls blocking waitpid(). Instead
fish uses the topic mechanism. For each reapable process, fish checks if
it has received a SIGCHLD since last poll; if not it waits until the next
SIGCHLD, and then polls them all."

topic_monitor allows for querying changes posted to one or more topics,
initially sigchld. This will eventually replace the waitpid logic in
process_mark_finished_children().

Comment from the new header:

Topic monitoring support. Topics are conceptually ""a thing that can
happen."" For example, delivery of a SIGINT, a child process exits, etc. It
is possible to post to a topic, which means that that thing happened.

Associated with each topic is a current generation, which is a 64 bit
value. When you query a topic, you get back a generation. If on the next
query the generation has increased, then it indicates someone posted to
the topic.

For example, if you are monitoring a child process, you can query the
sigchld topic. If it has increased since your last query, it is possible
that your child process has exited.

Topic postings may be coalesced. That is there may be two posts to a given
topic, yet the generation only increases by 1. The only guarantee is that
after a topic post, the current generation value is larger than any value
previously queried.

Tying this all together is the topic_monitor_t. This provides the current
topic generations, and also provides the ability to perform a blocking
wait for any topic to change in a particular topic set. This is the real
power of topics: you can wait for a sigchld signal OR a thread exit."

we can't redirect it.

Since it's not important that this gives the same error across
systems (and indeed we provide no way of intercepting the error!),
use an invocation test instead, because that allows different output per-uname.

This is a large change to how io_buffers are filled. The essential problem
comes about with code like (example):

    echo ( /bin/pwd )

The output of /bin/pwd must go to fish, not the tty. To arrange for this,
fish does the following:

1. Invoke pipe() to create a pipe.
2. Add an io_bufferfill_t redirection that owns the write end of the pipe.
3. After fork (or equiv), call dup2() to replace pwd's stdout with this  pipe.

Now when /bin/pwd writes, it will send output to the read end of the pipe.
But who reads it?

Prior to this fix, fish would do the following in a loop:

1. select() on the pipe with a 10 msec timeout
2. waitpid(WNOHANG) on the pwd proc

This polling is ugly and confusing and is what is replaced here.

With this new change, fish now reads from the pipe via a background thread:

1. Spawn a background pthread, which select()s on the pipe's read end with
a long (100 msec) timeout.
2. In the foreground, waitpid() (allowing hanging) on the pwd proc.

The big win here is a major simplification of job_t::continue_job() since
it no longer has to worry about filling buffers. This will make things
easier for concurrent execution.

It may not be obvious why the background thread still needs a poll (100 msec).
The answer is for cases where the write end of the fd escapes, in particular
background processes invoked inside command substitutions. psub is perhaps
the only important case of this (other shells typically just hang here)."

This is a large change to how io_buffers are filled. The essential problem
comes about with code like (example):

    echo ( /bin/pwd )

The output of /bin/pwd must go to fish, not the tty. To arrange for this,
fish does the following:

1. Invoke pipe() to create a pipe.
2. Add an io_bufferfill_t redirection that owns the write end of the pipe.
3. After fork (or equiv), call dup2() to replace pwd's stdout with this  pipe.

Now when /bin/pwd writes, it will send output to the read end of the pipe.
But who reads it?

Prior to this fix, fish would do the following in a loop:

1. select() on the pipe with a 10 msec timeout
2. waitpid(WNOHANG) on the pwd proc

This polling is ugly and confusing and is what is replaced here.

With this new change, fish now reads from the pipe via a background thread:

1. Spawn a background pthread, which select()s on the pipe's read end with
a long (100 msec) timeout.
2. In the foreground, waitpid() (allowing hanging) on the pwd proc.

The big win here is a major simplification of job_t::continue_job() since
it no longer has to worry about filling buffers. This will make things
easier for concurrent execution.

It may not be obvious why the background thread still needs a poll (100 msec).
The answer is for cases where the write end of the fd escapes, in particular
background processes invoked inside command substitutions. psub is perhaps
the only important case of this (other shells typically just hang here)."

b) `setlocale` changes the locale for the entire application, not
   just the calling thread. This means that even if we wrapped the

   would still be incorrect because this would incorrectly influence the
   results of locale-aware functions executed in other threads while

If a job is disowned that, for some reason, has a pgid that is special
to waitpid, like 0 (process with pgid of the calling process), -1 (any
process), or our actual pgid, that would lead to us waiting for too
many processes when we later try to reap the disowned processes (to
stop zombies from appearing).

And that means we'd snag away the processes we actually do want to
wait for, which would end with us in a waiting loop.

This is tough to reproduce, the easiest I've found was

    fish -ic 'sleep 5 &; disown; set -g __fish_git_prompt_showupstream auto; __fish_git_prompt'

in a git repo.

What we do is to not allow special pgids in the disowned_pids list.
That means we might leave a zombie around (though we probably wait on
0 somewhere), but that's preferable to infinitely looping.

- By key in env.cpp:is_read_only(), which is checked via set*

- By flag on the actual env_var_t, which is checked e.g. in
  parse_execution

The latter didn't happen for non-electric variables like hostname,
because they used the default constructor, because they were
constructed via operator[] (or some such C++-iness).

This caused for-loops to crash on an assert if they used a
non-electric read-only var like $hostname or $SHLVL.

Instead, we explicitly set the flag.

We might want to remove one of the two read-only checks, or something?

This makes the script worse, but it's good enough.

The required changes are:

- `shopt -s nullglob`, which we simply don't use (we have one glob, but that's
  guaranteed to match because we ship the files)

- One array, which we replace with a direct use of the glob (plus it
  used `echo` again?)

- The `function` word, which I'm still annoyed is even a thing!

- Variable indirection (`color=${!color_var}` - instead we pass the
  value directly - which makes the script uglier!)

- One array, which we replace with a function

- A use of `type -t`, replaced with `command -v`

- A use of `${var:begin:end}` substring expansion, replaced with trickery.

- `set -o pipefail` is replaced with a function

Note that checkbashisms still complains about `command -v`, because
we're not using it with ""-p"". But we _want_ to check the current
$PATH, and `command -v` is POSIX.

If a job is disowned that, for some reason, has a pgid that is special
to waitpid, like 0 (process with pgid of the calling process), -1 (any
process), or our actual pgid, that would lead to us waiting for too
many processes when we later try to reap the disowned processes (to
stop zombies from appearing).

And that means we'd snag away the processes we actually do want to
wait for, which would end with us in a waiting loop.

This is tough to reproduce, the easiest I've found was

    fish -ic 'sleep 5 &; disown; set -g __fish_git_prompt_showupstream auto; __fish_git_prompt'

in a git repo.

What we do is to not allow special pgids in the disowned_pids list.
That means we might leave a zombie around (though we probably wait on
0 somewhere), but that's preferable to infinitely looping.

- Colorize history search output when interactive, using

- Ask less to act like `cat` if the output will fit in the

- history is viewed in a pager when interactive, but pagers
  typically strip escape codes. We accomplish the above by
  doing exactly what `git` does[1] when it has colored output
  for a pager:
        if $LESS is unset, set it to enable -R, -F, and -X options.
	if $LV is unset, set it to -c.

If fish detects that it was started with a pgrp of 0 (which appears to
oddly be the case when run under firejail), create new process group for
fish and give it control of the terminal.

This selectively reverts 55b3c45 in cases where an invalid pgrp is
detected. Note that this is known to cause problems in other cases, such
as #3805 and Microsoft/WSL#1653, although the former may have been
ameliorated or even addressed by the recent job control overhaul, so
that's why we are careful to only assign fish to its own pgroup if an
invalid pgroup was detected and not as the normal case."

complete paths at the command-line as if they were relative to a
path other than the current $PWD. Given that `$PWD` is currently
global in fish (i.e. no side-effect free `cd` within a subshell)
this is probably good to have for other completions too.

This also fixes a bug in support for explicitly supplying the
description for completions via a `$argv` parameter, which prefixed
the description with `\t` (which is correct) except it did so in
the local scope within an `if` statement, meaning the changes never
had any effect and in the output the description was directly

When a function is encountered by exec_job, a new context is created for
its execution from the ground up, with a new job and all, ultimately
resulting in a recursive call to exec_job from the same (main) thread.

Since each time exec_job encounters a new job with external commands
that needs terminal control it creates a new pgrp and gives it control
of the terminal (tcsetpgrp & co), this effectively takes control away
from the previously spawned external commands which may be (and likely
are) expecting to still have terminal access.

This commit attempts to detect when such a situation arises by handling
recursive calls to exec_job (which can only happen if the pipeline
included a function) by borrowing the pgrp from the (necessarily still
active) parent job and spawning new external commands into it.

When a parent job spawns new jobs due to the evaluation of a new
function (which shouldn't be the case in the first place), we end up
with two distinct jobs sharing one pgrp (to fix #3952). This can lead to
early termination of a pgrp if finished parent job children are reaped
before future processes in either the parent or future child jobs can
join it.

While the parent job is under construction, require that waitpid(2)
calls for the child job be done by process id and not job pgrp.

Closes #3952."

Use SIGCHLD to determine whether or not waitpid(2) calls can be elided,
but only with extreme caution. If we receive SIGCHLD but are not able to

For this to work, we need to make sure that we reap all children that we
can reap after a SIGCHLD, i.e. it's not OK to just reap the first and
return or else we can never clear the dirty state flag.

In all cases, as expensive as a call to waitpid() may be, if a child
process is available for reaping it is always cheaper to wait on it then
reap it than to call select_try() and end up timing out."

Use clang/clang++'s own autocompletion support to complete arguments. It
is rather convoluted as clang generates autocompletions for a portion of
the current token rather than the entire token, e.g. while `--st` will
autocomplete to `--std=` (which is fine by fish), `--std=g` will
autocomplete to `gnu...` without the leading `--std=` which breaks fish'
support for the completion.

Additionally, on systems where clang/clang++ is the system compiler
(such as FreeBSD), it is very often for users to invoke a newer version
of clang/clang++ installed as clang[++]-NN instead of clang. Using a
monkey-patched version of `complete -p` to support that without breaking
(future) completions for commands like `clang-format`.

This commit begins to bake in a notion of path-style variables.

Prior to this fix, fish would export arrays as ASCII record separator
delimited, except for a whitelist (PATH, CDPATH, MANPATH). This is
surprising and awkward for other programs to deal with, and there's no way
to get similar behavior for other variables like GOPATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

This commit does the following:

1. Exports all arrays as colon delimited strings, instead of RS.

2. Introduces a notion of ""path variable."" A path variable will be
""colon-delimited"" which means it gets colon-separated in quoted expansion,
and automatically splits on colons. In this commit we only do the exporting
part.

Colons are not escaped in exporting; this is deliberate to support uses
like

    `set -x PYTHONPATH ""/foo:/bar""`

which ought to work (and already do, we don't want  to make a compat break
here)."

Adds a new match mode for `string_fuzzy_match_t` that matches against a

lower priority of match than a same-case match (when present).

There's been no reproducible case entered for #5080, but the stack trace
indicates the problem is with env_get_pwd_slash() returning an empty
string, which isn't a string that terminates in `/`.

In addition to making the failure case to return the path `./` (which
has the benefit of having the same meaning as $PWD), trying a little bit
harder to retrieve the real PWD by using getcwd(3). While
get_current_dir(3) is documented as relying on PWD, getcwd(3) does not
mention any such caveats, so it's possible that it will work even if
something is breaking PWD.

Just a thought, but it's possible if due to some recursion PWD surpassed
some predetermined value (maybe PATH_MAX) that PWD (on certain platforms
or under certain enivronments) won't be set (hence the code that deals
with ERANGE errors from the getcwd(3) call).

As reported in fish-shell/fish-shell#5180, when the USER environment
variable is not set and fish is started, `get_runtime_path()` returns a
blank string. At some point in the past, this was called after
`setup_user()` in env.cpp, but this is no longer the case.

This commit removes the reliance on the $USER environment variable
entirely, and instead uses `getpwuid(geteuid()).pw_name` to retrieve the
current username.

Closes #5180."

__fish_complete_suffix assumed that the only literal . in a path

a literal . in a directory name.

__fish_complete_suffix does not just complete extensions (or at the

isolating the path name without the extension was unnecessary in all

Our completion machinery calls our `__fish_describe_command` function
to describe commands via apropos. Only it trusts the output a bit too
much, so it crashes when any line from that is shorter than the
original string.

Fix this by skipping any string that is shorter than the original,
since it can't be a match anyway.

Also stop doing wcslen so often - std::strings are nice!

There really is no need to

- Timeout just because the _first_ character was a control character

- Timeout because of any control character other than escape

The reason to timeout because the '\e' sequence can appear by itself (signifying
pressing the escape key) and still make
sense - e.g. vi-mode has it bound to a rather important function!

But a \c can't appear by itself, so we can just block.

This allows binding sequences like \cx\ce and inputting them at a
leisurely pace rather than the frantic escape_timeout one.

It should also improve sequences that _include_ escape somewhere else.

E.g. something like a\eb (""a, then alt+b"") should now time out for the ""\eb"" part,
allowing users to bind a\e (""a, then escape"") to something else. Why you'd want to do
that, I have no idea. But it's more consistent, and that's nice!"

That's quite a bit of time just to throw away the output and use the
exit code.

So we just check for ""GNU"" in the version string.

It would be nice to just _do_ the completion and fall back on the
BSD-style if it doesn't work, but that is tricky to do with the pipe

This uses the same logic that git uses to determine the satus of files

relative paths (such as `git add ../f<TAB>`). Should be faster and more
reliable than manually parsing porcelain status.

This doesn't support as many cases as the old `__git_ls_files` function
did (e.g. `renamed` is not supported, nor is `added`), both of which
_can_ be implemented on top of the new logic - but neither of which were
actually being used, anyway.

takes around 660ms to run, all-in-all - a not insignificant overhead.

Output can be cached (based off of ./configure hash or mtime) in the
future if this is a big deal."

complete.cpp strips the path from commands before parsing for
completions, meaning that when we called `path_get_path()` against
`cmd`, if `./cmd` were typed in at the command line but `cmd` does not
exist in the PATH, then the command would incorrectly be flagged as not
present and the completions would be skipped.

This is also faster when an absolute/relative path is used for a
command, as we now search with the original path which skips searching
PATH directories unnecessarily.

Found when debugging why completions for `./configure` wouldn't work."

`read` with IFS empty was expected to set all parameters after the first
n filled variables to an empty string, but that was inconsistent with
the behavior of `read` everywhere else.

I'm not sure why fish differed from the spec with regards to the
behavior in the event of an empty IFS: we eschew IFS where possible, yet
here we adopt non-standard behavior splitting on every (unicode)
character instead of not splitting at all with IFS empty. We still do
that, but now the unset variables are treated as they normally would be,
i.e. cleared and not set to an empty string (which is what an empty
value between two IFS separators would contain)."

emitted since the code clashed with a return code for `env_set()`.

This addresses the discussion regarding the dependency on `hostname` and
the addition of a `$hostname` variable to replace it.

`$hostname` is a read-only, GLOBAL_ENV, non-electrified, lowercased,
non-exported variable that is read once at the start of a fish session.
The finer points of this can be debated endlessly, but this is a shared
starting point that any changes can build on (ref #4422).

Regarding performance: @krader1961 brought up some good points in #4422
regarding potential DNS timeouts (but they really don't apply except if
the host name is not hardcoded in resolv.conf, which quickly manifests
with a cascade of errors on most *nix systems in all cases), but note
that gethostname() was already being called by fish so that would be
more of a future optimization than a ""must"" at this point."

The variables %self and %last, referring to fish's own pid and the pid
of the last backgrounded job respectively, have been replaced with $pid
and $last_pid. These are read-only variables, protected against being
redefined by the user.

Author's note: I would have personally preferred $fish_pid instead of
$pid but since we debated changing $version to $fish_version and then
reverted that change (with much acrimony), it makes no sense to break
with that precedent here. Additionally, $fish_last_pid is quite wordy.

This turns a bunch of ifs on their heads.

We often see this pattern in te:

```c
if (s->type != SOME_TYPE) {
   // error handling
}  else {
   // normal code
}
```

Only, since we want to return the first error, we do

```c
if (s->type == SOME_TYPE) {
    // normal code
} else if (s->type != TOK_ERROR) {
    // Add a new error - if it already has type error
    // this should already be handled.
}
```

One big issue is the comma operator, that means arity-1 functions can
take an arbitrary number of arguments. E.g.

```fish
math ""sin(5,9)""
```

will return the value of sin for _9_, since this is read as ""5 COMMA
9""."

This is part of an effort to improve fish's Unicode handling. This commit
attempts to grapple with the fact that, certain characters (principally
emoji) were considered to have a wcwidth of 1 in Unicode 8, but a width of
2 in Unicode 9.

The system wcwidth() here cannot be trusted; terminal emulators do not
respect it. iTerm2 even allows this to be set in preferences.

This commit introduces a new function is_width_2_in_Uni9_but_1_in_Uni8() to
detect characters of version-ambiguous width. For these characters, it
returns a width guessed based on the value of TERM_PROGRAM and
TERM_VERSION, defaulting to 1. This value can be overridden by setting the
value of a new variable fish_emoji_width (presumably either to 1 or 2).

The job control functions were a bit messy, in particular
`set_child_group`'s name would imply that all it does is set the child

set the job's pgrp if it hasn't been set, and possibly assign control of
the terminal to the newly-created job.

These have been split into separate functions. Now `set_child_group`
does just (and only) that, `maybe_assign_terminal` might assign the
terminal to the new pgrp, and `on_process_created` is used to set the
job properties the first time an external process is created. This might
also speed things up (but probably not noticeably) as there are no more
repeated calls to `getpgrp()` if JOB_CONTROL is not set.

Additionally, this closes #4715 by no longer unconditionally calling
`setpgid` on all new processes, including those created by `posix_spawn`

Some details: Coverity Scan was complaining about an apparent double-unlock

asserts that a lock is locked by asserting that try_lock fails; if it

This merges a sequence of commits that undoes the SIGCONT orchestration
used for WSL compatibility. The essential problem is this: In Unix and
Linux, exited processes are still valid until it is reaped; you can, say,
make an exited process a group leader. But in Windows, when a process
exits, it is gone, and most syscalls (other than, say, waitpid) fail for
it. This is known as the WSL Rick Grimes problem.

This manifests as various race conditions in WSL between a parent operating
on a child, and the child exiting. Prior to this merge, these were
addressed by having the child wait for the parent to send it a SIGCONT.
This resolved the race.

This merge removes this approach and replaces it with a simpler mechanism
that leverages the existing keepalive machinery. A keepalive process is
created for all platforms when we have a pipeline that contains a builtin.
This is necessary to keep the whole process group alive. The fix is, on
WSL, we always create a keepalive and make it the group leader. Because the
keepalive does not call exec and its lifetime is bound to a C++ stack
frame, it is easy to resolve the race.

This improves performance a bit (except on WSL), since child processes no
longer have to synchronize with the parent process, but the big win is
simplicity. This removes the notion of the single global stopped child, of
which there could only be one, and which had be resumed at the right
time(s), of which there were several."

There were several issues with the way that the include tests for curses.h
were being done that were ultimately causing fish to use the headers from
ncurses but link against curses on platforms that provide an actual
libcurses.so that isn't just a symlink to libncurses.so

In particular, the old code was first testing for curses's cureses.h and then
falling back to libncurses's implementation of the same - but that logic was
reversed when it came to including term.h, in which case it was testing for
the ncurses term.h and falling back to the curses.h header. Long story short,
while cmake will link against libcurses.so if both libcurses.so and
libncurses.so are present (unless CURSES_NEED_NCURSES evaluates to TRUE, but
that makes ncurses a hard requirement), but we were brining in some of the
defines from the ncurses headers, causing SIGSEGV panics when fish ultimately
tried to access variables that weren't exported or were mapped to undefined
areas of memory in the other library.

Additionally it is an error to include termios.h prior to including the plain
Jane curses.h (not ncurses/curses.h), causing errors about unimplemented types
SGTTY/chtype. So far as I can tell, both curses.h and ncurses/curses.h pull in
termios.h themselves so it shouldn't even be necessary to manually include it,
but I have just moved its #include below that of curses.h"

This merges a set of changes to improve the type safety of the fish parse
tree, in preparation for modifying fish grammar in 3.0. It expresses the
fish grammar via a new file parse_grammar.h. It then adds a new type
tnode_t parametrized on grammar elements, with typesafe access to its
children.

The idea here is to make it easy to change the fish grammar, and have the
compiler report code locations that must to be updated.

This untangles the CMake versioning issues (I hope) as discussed in #4626.
Note most of the advice found on the Internet about how to inject git
versions into CMake is just wrong.

The behavior we want is to unconditionally run the script
build_tools/git_version_gen.sh at build time (i.e. when you invoke ninja or
make, and not when you invoke cmake, which is build system generation time).
This script is careful to only update the FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE if the
contents have changed, to avoid spurious rebuilding dependencies of
FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE. Assuming the git version hasn't changed, the script
will run, but not update FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE, and therefore
fish_version.o will not have to be rebuilt.

This might normally rebuild more than is necessary even if the timestamp is
not updated, because ninja computes the dependency chain ahead of time. But
Ninja also supports the 'restat' option for just this case, and CMake is rad
and exposes this via BYPRODUCTS. So mark FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE as a
byproduct and make the script always update a dummy file
(fish-build-version-witness.txt). Note this is the use case for which
BYPRODUCTS is designed.

We also have fish_version.cpp #include ""FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE"", and do a
semi-silly thing and make FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE valid C++ (so there's just
one version file). This means we have to filter out the quotes in other
cases.."

CMake originally links build artifacts/results so that they can run from
the target directory. As a result, it must first relink the binaries
before installation so that they can run from the installation target
directory, typically done in the preinstall stage. Ninja does not have a
preinstall stage, and the CMake code that generates the build.ninja file
does not take that into account [0].

Setting `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` [1] makes it originally link
the files with the RPATH settings for the final destination directory,
meaning that relinking is no longer needed.

Technically setting the RPATH is not required for the `fish` binary as
we do not have any relative dependencies; this is the output of
`ldd ./build/fish`:

```

However, since the bug only exists when the build generator is set to
ninja, the workaround is only activated for that specific build
generator to prevent any future problems.

Profiling with callgrind revealed that about 60% of the time in a `something | string match` call
was actually spent in `string_get_arg_stdin()`,
because it was calling `read` one byte at a time.

This makes it read in chunks similar to builtin read.

This increases performance for `getent hosts | string match -v '0.0.0.0*'` from about 300ms to about 30ms (i.e. 90%).
At that point it's _actually_ quicker than `grep`.

To improve performance even more, we'd have to cut down on str2wcstring.

Prior to this fix, a ""bare variable"" in math like 'x + 1' would be
looked up in the environment, i.e. equivalent to '$x + 1'. This appears
to have been done for performance. However this breaks the orthogonality
of fish; performance is not a sufficient justification to give math this
level of built-in power, especially because the performance of math is
not a bottleneck. The implementation is also ugly.

Remove this feature so that variables must be prefixed with the dollar
sign and undergo normal variable expansion. Reading 'git grep' output
does not show any uses of this in fish functions or completions.

Also added to changelog.

This silences binding errors due to keys not found in the current

Closes #4188, #4431, and obviates the original fix for #1155

It was necessary to re-implement builtin_bind as a class in order to
avoid passing around the options array from function to function and
as adding an opts parameter to `get_terminfo_sequence` would require
otps to be passed to all other builtin_bind_ functions so they could, in
turn, pass it to `get_terminfo_sequence`."

On powerpc64 (big-endian platform) one test failed as:

  Output differs for file printf.in. Diff follows:

  +a B 10 18446744073709551615

It happens due to roughly the following code:
    swprintf(..., L""%o"", (long long)8);
Here mismatch happens between ""%o"" (requires 32-bit value)
and 'long long' (requires 64-bit value).

The fix turns it effectively to:
    swprintf(..., L""%llo"", (long long)8);
as it was previously done for 'x', 'd' and other int-like types.

Makes tests pass on powerpc64.

We can't make this the default because too many people expect the
current behavior. This simply makes it possible for people to define
their own abbreviations or functions that provide behavior they are
likely used to if they are transitioning to fish from another shell.

handles the `-n` / `--max` flag.

branches after, and tags at the bottom - I don't believe we have that

The type cached_esc_sequences_t caches escape sequences, and is tasked

instead stores all cached escape sequences in a sorted vector, and uses
binary search to find the shortest escape sequence that is a prefix of
the input. This is a substantial simplification that also reduces

    Convert const_string_set_t to std::unordered_set

    As it is a readonly-list of raw character pointer strings (not
    wcstring), this necessitated the addition of a hashing function since
    the C++ standard library does not come with a char pointer hash
    function.

    To that end, a zlib-licensed [0] port of the excellent, lightweight
    XXHash family of 32- and 64-bit hashing algorithms in the form of a C++
    header-only include library has been included. XXHash32/64 is pretty
    much universally the fastest hashing library for general purpose
    applications, and has been thoroughly vetted and is used in countless
    open source projects. The single-header version of this library makes it
    a lot simpler to include in the fish project, and the license
    compatibility with fish' GPLv2 and the zero-lib nature should make it an
    easy decision.

    std::unordered_set brings a massive speedup as compared to the default
    std::set, and the further use of the fast XXHash library to provide the
    string hashing should make all forms of string lookups in fish
    significantly faster (to a user-noticeable extent).

So, until I can figure out how to unbreak them:

* Fix clearing abandoned line with VTE

With VTE-based terminals, resizing currently causes multi-line prompts
to go weird.

This changes the sequence we use to clear the line to one suggested by
a VTE
developer (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=763390#c4).

It changes nothing in konsole 17.04.3 and urxvt 9.22, but they already
work.

Note that this does not fix the case where output did not end in a
newline, but that doesn't seem to be up to us. Also, it only affects
those lines.

Fixes #2320.

* Use terminfo definition instead of hardcoding

Thanks to @ixjlyons."

Make the `env_var_t::missing_var()` object a singleton rather than a

since C++ doesn't directly support immutable objects. But it is slightly
more efficient and helps identify code that incorrectly mutates `env_var_t`
objects that should not be modified."

* Fix clearing abandoned line with VTE

With VTE-based terminals, resizing currently causes multi-line prompts
to go weird.

This changes the sequence we use to clear the line to one suggested by
a VTE
developer (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=763390#c4).

It changes nothing in konsole 17.04.3 and urxvt 9.22, but they already
work.

Note that this does not fix the case where output did not end in a
newline, but that doesn't seem to be up to us. Also, it only affects
those lines.

Fixes #2320.

* Use terminfo definition instead of hardcoding

Thanks to @ixjlyons."

Setting the process group in a fork/exec scenario is a well-documented
race condition in pretty much any job control mechanism [0] [1]. The
Wikipedia article contradicts the glibc article and suggests that the
best approach is for the parent to wait for the child to become the
process group leader, while the glibc article suggests that both should
make it so (which is what fish did previously). However, I'm running
into cases where tcsetpgrp is causing an EPERM error, which it isn't
documented to do except if the session id for the calling process
differs from that of the target process group (which is never the case
in fish since they are all part of the same session), which should cause
a _different_ error (SIGTTOU to be sent to all members of the calling
process' group).

In all cases, this is easily remedied by checking if the process group
in question is already in control of the terimnal. There's still the
off-chance that in the time between we check that and the time that the
command completes that situation may have changed, but the parent
process is supposed to ignore the result of this call if it errors out.

We were having child processes SIGSTOP themselves immediately after
setting their process group and before launching their intended targets,
but they were not necessarily stopped by the time the next command was
being executed (so the opposite of the original race condition where
they might have finished executing by the time the next command came
around), and as a result when we sent them SIGCONT, that could never
reach. Now using waitpid to synchronize the SIGSTOP/SIGCONT between the
two.

If we had a good, unnamed inter-process event/semaphore, we could use
that to have a child process conditionally stop itself if the next
command in the job chain hadn't yet been started / setup, but this is
probably a lot more straightforward and less-confusing, which isn't a
bad thing.

Additionally, there was a bug caused by the fact that the main exec_job
loop actually blocks to read from previous commands in the job if the
current command is a built-in that doesn't need to fork.

With this waitpid code, I was able to finally add the SIGSTOP code to
all the fork'd processes in the main exec_job loop without introducing
deadlocks; it turns out that they should be treated just like the main
EXTERNAL fork, but they tend to execute faster causing the same deadlock
described above to occur more readily.

The only thing I'm not sure about is whether we should execute
unblock_pid undconditionally for all !EXTERNAL commands. It makes more
sense to *only* do that if a blocking read were about to be done in the
main loop, otherwise the original race condition could still appear
(though it is probably mitigated by whatever duration the SIGSTOP lasted
for, even if it is SIGCONT'd before the next command tries to join the
process group)."

I'm not sure if this happens on all platforms, but under WSL with the
existing codebase, processes in the job chain that pipe their
stdout/stderr to the next process in the job could terminate before the
next job started (on fast enough machines for quick enough jobs).

This caused issues like #4235 and possibly #3952, at least for external
commands. What was happening is that the first process was finishing
before the second process was fully set up. fish would then try to
assign (in both the child and the parent) the process group id belonging
to the process group leader to the new process; and if the first process
had already terminated, it would have ended its process group with it as
well before that happened.

I'm not sure if there was already a mechanism in place for ensuring that
a process remains running at least as long as it takes for the next
process in the chain to join its group, etc., but if that code was
there, it wasn't working in my test setup (WSL).

This patch definitely needs some review; I'm not sure how I should
handle non-external commands (and external commands executed via
posix_spawn). I don't know if they are affected by the race condition in
the first place, but when I tried to add the same ""wait for next command
in chain to run before unblocking"" that would cause black screens
requiring ctrl+c to bypass.

The ""unblock previous command"" code was originally run by the next child
to be forked, but was then moved to the shell code instead, making it
more-centrally located and less error-prone.

Note that additional headers may be required for the mmap system call on
other platforms."

about doing things like assigning the former to the latter type, relying

Introduce a -k/--keep-order switch to `complete` that can be used to
prevent fish from sorting/re-ordering the results provided by a completion
source.

In addition, this patch does so without doing away with deduplication
of completions by introducing a new unique_unsorted(..) helper function
that removes duplicates in-place without affecting the general order of
the vector/container.

Note that the code now uses a stable sort for completions, since the
behavior of is_naturally_less_than as of this patch now means that the
results are not necessarily _actually_ identical just because that function
repeatedly returns false for any ordering of any given two elements.

Also, prior to this commit, both `__fish_complete_npm` and `__fish_npm_run` were being run

When executing a function, local-exported (`set -lx`) variables
previously were not accessible at all. This is weird e.g. in case of
aliases, since

```fish
set -lx PAGER cat
git something # which will call $PAGER
```

would not work if `git` were a function, even if that ends up calling
`command git`.

Now, we copy these variables, so functions get a local-exported copy.

```fish
function x
    echo $var
    set var wurst
    echo $var
end
set -lx var banana
x # prints ""banana"" and ""wurst""
echo $var # prints ""banana""
```

One weirdness here is that, if a variable is both local and global,
the local-copy takes precedence:

```fish
set -gx var banana
set -lx var pineapple
echo $var # prints ""pineapple""
x # from above, prints ""pineapple"" and ""wurst""
echo $var # still prints ""pineapple""
set -el var # deletes local version
echo $var # ""banana"" again
```

I don't think there is any more consistent way to handle this - the
local version is the one that is accessed first, so it should also be
written to first.

Global-exported variables are _not_ copied, instead they still offer
full read-write access."

The new '-C' initial command needs some tests, and as there are no
tests just yet for the command invocation, this change adds a harness
and calls it from the high-level tests in the Makefile.

The tests are similar in style to the other high level tests, in that
we capture the output and compare it to that which we expect. The
harness itself is written in bash - sorry - because we're testing the
fish shell's invocation, and trying to do that with the fish we've
just built wouldn't actually make for a very useful test when things
go wrong.

The 'tests/invocation.sh' script can be executed manually, or as part
of the 'make test' target, to make it easy to use both as part of the
development and as part of automation.

The harness has only been tested on linux with bash 4.3.11, and requires
grep and sed. Although not tested with OS X, I believe I have avoided
the syntax which is inconsistent.

The tests added here cover just the initial command's basic execution,
and when it is mixed with the regular '-c' command."

In order to allow the execution of commands before dropping to an
interactive prompt, a new switch, '-C' or '--init-command' has been
added to those switches that we accept.

The documentation has been updated correspondingly.

The original code only supported a single command list to be executed,
and this command list terminates the shell when it completes. To allow
the new command list to preceed the original one, both have been
wrapped in a new container class 'command_line_switches_t'. This is
then passed around in place of the list of strings we used previously.

I had considered moving the interactive, login and other command line
switch states into this container, but doing so would change far more
of the code, moving the structure to be available globally, and I
wasn't confident of the impact. However, this might be a useful thing
to do in the future.

A new function, run_command_list, was lifted from the prior execution
code, and re-used for both the initial command and the regular command
execution."

The Haiku stdio library has a bug. If we set stdout to unbuffered and it
is attached to a tty it discards wide output. Given how we interact with
the tty it should be safe to replace the problematic `fputwc()` calls
with simple `write()` calls. This does depend on the rest of the fish
code that writes to the tty to ultimately call write() which is true at
this time and should remain true in the future.

This change does several things. First, it works around a quirk of the
`xgetttext` command that only recognizes description strings in even
numbered position on the command. Second, it allows descriptions
introduced by the `-d` short flag to be recognized.

More importantly, it normalizes the strings so that `xgettext` correctly
extracts them into the *.po file. Prior to this change many fish script
strings were ignored due to how they were written (e.g., single versus
double quotes).

I recently upgraded the software on my macOS server and was dismayed to
see that cppcheck reported a huge number of format string errors due to
mismatches between the format string and its arguments from calls to
`assert()`. It turns out they are due to the macOS header using `%lu`
for the line number which is obviously wrong since it is using the C
preprocessor `__LINE__` symbol which evaluates to a signed int.

I also noticed that the macOS implementation writes to stdout, rather
than stderr. It also uses `printf()` which can be a problem on some
platforms if the stream is already in wide mode which is the normal case
for fish.

So implement our own `assert()` implementation. This also eliminates
double-negative warnings that we get from some of our calls to
`assert()` on some platforms by oclint.

Also reimplement the `DIE()` macro in terms of our internal
implementation.

Rewrite `assert(0 && msg)` statements to `DIE(msg)` for clarity and to
eliminate oclint warnings about constant expressions.

Fixes #3276, albeit not in the fashion I originally envisioned."

We now are stingier with taking history file locks - if the lock
is held too long we may just break it. But the current file save
architecture holds the lock for the duration of the save. It also
has some not-quite-right checks that can cause spurious failures in
the history stress test.

Reimplement the history save to retry. Rather than holding the lock,
rewrite the file to a temporary location and then take the lock. If
the history file has changed, start all over.

This is going to be slower under contention, but the advantage is that
the lock is only held for a brief period (stat + rename) rather than
across calls to write().

Some updated logic also fixes spurious failures that were easy to observe
when tsan was enabled. These failures were due to failing to check if the
file at the path was the same file we opened.

The next step is to move the history file saving to a background thread
to reduce the chances of it impacting user's typing."

Cache the escape sequences we've seen when checking for those which
don't take any visual space when writing the prompt or similar strings.
This reduces the cost of determining the true cost of such strings by a
full order of magnitude if they include lots of such escape sequences.

Periodically sort the cached escape sequence lengths based on feedback
from cache hits so that we're always checking for the most likely
sequence lengths first.

Also cache the prompt layouts to avoid doing the calculations if the
prompt doesn't change.

On some platforms, notably GNU libc, you cannot mix narrow and wide
stdio functions on a stream like stdout or stderr. Doing so will drop
the output of one or the other. This change makes all output to the
stderr stream consistently use the wide forms.

This change also converts some fprintf(stderr,...) calls to debug()
calls where appropriate.

Fish is not consistent with other shells like bash and zsh when exiting
an interactive shell with background jobs. While it is true that fish
explicitly claims no compatibility with POSIX 1003.1 this is an area
where deviation from the established practice adds negative value.

The reason for the current behavior seems to be due to two users who did
not understand why interactive shells managed background jobs as they
did and were not aware of tools like `nohup` or `disown`. See issue

There is also a fairly significant bug present due to a misunderstanding of
what a true value from `reader_exit_forced()` means. This change corrects
that misunderstanding.

There were two places in the code that used the anti-pattern of
returning True on success else an error message. In python you should
always be able to replace `if x == True:` with just `if x:`. Which is
what the lint tool recommended. Unfortunately I didn't notice how the
return value was being used. This fixes that by changing the two
affected functions to return an error message or None on success.

This also adds `from __future__ import print_function` since the code
uses the `print(msg)` function form rather than the `print msg`
statement form. The former works by accident on python2 because the
parens are interpreted as creating parenthesized expression that
devolves to the single string inside the parens. So while the future
import isn't strictly speaking necessary it will help avoid mistakes in
the future if more complex `print()` calls are added.

deal with inconsistencies between BSD, GNU, and other UNIXes.

This does make some syntax more liberal. For example `echo $PATH[1 .. 3]`

The `status` command currently silently allows incompatible flags (i.e.,
subcommands). Too, using flags to specify subcommands misleads the user

subcommands. This change does the same for the `status` command.

There are good reasons to use the behavior this reverts, namely g++

when `configure` says using ""g++"" that doens't tell us much.

On more systems than not, as far as I can tell, clang++ will often be a

the existing `wrealpath()` function that I simply exposed as a builtin

Also, while the decision to call the builtin `fish_realpath` seemed to

Fish assumed that it could use tparm to emit escapes to set colors
as long as the color was under 16 or max_colors from terminfo was 256::

 if (idx < 16 || term256_support_is_native()) {
    // Use tparm to emit color escape
    writembs(tparm(todo, idx);

If a terminal has max_colors = 8, here is what happenened, except
inside fish:

 > env TERM=xterm tput setaf 7 | xxd
   00000000: 1b5b 3337 6d                             .[37m
 > env TERM=xterm tput setaf 9 | xxd
   00000000: 1b5b 3338 6d                             .[39m

The first escape is good, that second escape is not valid.
Bright colors should start at \e[90m:

 > env TERM=xterm-16color tput setaf 9 | xxd
   00000000: 1b5b 3931 6d                             .[91m

This is what caused ""white"" not to work in #3176 in Terminal.app, and
obviously isn't good for real low-color terminals either.

So we replace the term256_support_is_native(), which just checked if
max_colors is 256 or not, with a function that takes an argument and
checks terminfo for that to see if tparm can handle it. We only use this
test, because otherwise, tparm should be expected to output garbage:

 /// Returns true if we think tparm can handle outputting a color index
 static bool term_supports_color_natively(unsigned int c) { return max_colors >= c; }
...

 if (term_supports_color_natively(idx) {

And if terminfo can't do it, the ""forced"" escapes no longer use the fancy
format when handling colors under 16, as this is not going to be compatible with
low color terminals. The code before used:

 else {
     char buff[16] = """";
     snprintf(buff, sizeof buff, ""\x1b[%d;5;%dm"", is_fg ? 38 : 48, idx);

I added an intermediate format for colors 0-15:

 else {
     // We are attempting to bypass the term here. Generate the ANSI escape sequence ourself.
     char buff[16] = """";
     if (idx < 16) {
         snprintf(buff, sizeof buff, ""\x1b[%dm"", ((idx > 7) ? 82 : 30) + idx + !is_fg * 10);
     } else {
         snprintf(buff, sizeof buff, ""\x1b[%d;5;%dm"", is_fg ? 38 : 48, idx);
     }

Restores harmony to white, brwhite, brblack, black color names.
We don't want ""white"" to refer to color color #16, but to the
standard color #8. #16 is ""brwhite"".

Move comments from output.h to output.cpp

Nuke the config.fish set_color hack for linux VTs.

Sync up our various incomplete color lists and fix all color values.
Colors 0-8 are assumed to be brights - e.g. red was FF0000. Perplexing!

we would take some wildcard segment, attempt to locate it in the

I did some research and experiments. For good or bad the `bind` command
requires the use of wide char codepoints (e.g., \u1234) for non-ASCII
chars.  So don't force the use of the POSIX locale, but do provide it as
an option for people who want to see the individual bytes rather than a
decoded wide char.

Simplify the format of the information displayed for each character. There
really isn't much point in providing decimal, octal, and hexadecimal. Just
print hex and symbolic representations.

Add an example `bind` command that a user can copy/paste.

2. It is allowed to have a single = and whitespace between the keyword and the argument(s).
3. It is possible to add multiple host names under a single Host directive by spacing the names apart.

1. and 3. are actual conventions that we use in our team, and I couldn't get auto-complete working for fish without this modification.

Modification explained:
a. The space between Host(?:name)? and the \w.* was replaced by (?:\s+|\s*=\s*) to match any sequence of whitespace characters, or optional whitespaces with a single =, per spec.
b. Result of first replacement is piped through another string replace to switch duplicate whitespace characters to a single space, and then piped to be split by that space. This allows specifying several aliases or host names in a single Host/Hostname definition, also per spec."

An example is in share/functions - a completion for ""inter"" would
previously expand to ""__fish_"" because it matched:

- __fish_config_interactive.fish
- __fish_print_interfaces.fish
- __fish_print_lpr_printers.fish

Cppcheck was complaining about the `return val.c_str()` at the end of the
`wgettext()` function. That would normally a bug since the lifetime of
`val` ends when the function returns. In this particular case that's not
true because the string is interned in a cache. Nonetheless, rather than
suppress the lint warning I decided to modify the API to be more idiomatic.

In the process of fixing the aforementioned lint warning I fixed several other
lint errors in that module.

This required making our copy of `wgetopt()` compatible with the rest of
the fish code. Specifically, by removing its local definitions of the
""_"" macro so it uses the same macro used everywhere else in the fish
code. The sooner we kill the use of wide chars the better."

a sequence longer than four bytes (which the Unicode standard made illegal
long ago) keeps us from having encoding errors on those OS's.

This also makes the errors reported by the `test_convert()` function actually
useful and readable.

This change does several things. First, and most important, it allows
dumping the ""n"" most recent stack frames on each debug() call. Second,
it demangles the C++ symbols. Third, it prepends each debug() message
with the debug level.

Unrelated to the above I've replaced all `assert(!is_forked_child());`

It's currently too easy for someone to bork their shell by doing something
like `function test; return 0; end`. That's obviously a silly, contrived,
example but the point is that novice users who learn about functions are
prone to do something like that without realizing it will bork the shell. Even
expert users who know about the `test` builtin might forget that, say, `pwd`
is a builtin.

This change adds a `--shadow-builtin` flag that must be specified to
indicate you know what you're doing.

Make the history code conform to the new style guide. Every change was
produced by clang-format (e.g., `make style`) with the exception of
comments which were manually reformatted.  That has to be done by hand
since clang-format leaves comments alone other than to reflow comment
lines to get them below the allowed line length.

The total number of lines is reduced by 313 lines (13%) in the two
affected files. Line count is generally a poor metric but in this
case it reflects an increase in information density without a loss in
readability. Furthermore, the standardization of braces, whitespace,
and comment style will make it easier for people to read the code.

This reduces the number of warnings by `make lint` from 168 to 87 (a 48%
decrease). Making it much easier to focus on the substantive lint issues.

Further improvements are possible. For example, many comments are not
very helpful (e.g., they point out the obvious) or provide insufficient
detail. But those are beyond the scope of this change.

This is the first step in resolving issue #2902."

any special characters in the PATH would be interpreted when performing
tab completion.

With this fix, we pull the PATH resolution out of complete.cpp and
migrate it to expand.cpp. This unifies nicely with the CDPATH resolution
already in that file. This requires introducing a new expand flag
EXPAND_SPECIAL_FOR_COMMAND, which is analogous to EXPAND_SPECIAL_CD
(which is renamed to EXPAND_SPECIAL_FOR_CD). This flag tells expand to

The early return skipped all cleanup.
This problem is a case for the classic ""goto fail"" paradigm, but this
change instead makes a few adjustments to take advantage of a previously
unused level of indentation to conditionally execute the success path.

The error message now prints the filename instead of ""open"",
which should be more idiomatic.

Tip:
This patch makes sense if viewed with `git show --ignore-space-change`."

I noticed while fixing issue #2702 that the fish program being tested
was sourcing config.fish files outside of the current build. This also
happens when Travis CI runs the tests but isn't an issue there because
of how Travis is configured to execute the tests.

I also noticed that running `make test` was polluting my personal fish
history; which will become a bigger problem if and when the fishd universal
var file is moved from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME to $XDG_DATA_HOME.

This change makes it possible for an individual to run the tests on
their local machine secure in the knowledge that only the config.fish and
related files from their git repository will be used and doing so won't
pollute their personal fish history.

track of the buffer size separately where pcre2 can't touch it.

A better fix would be to let pcre2 tell fish what size buffer it needs.
This can be done with PCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_OVERFLOW_LENGTH, but this
requires pcre2 10.21 or later (released January 12), which may be too
new to introduce as a dependency at this point.

My PR #2578 had the unexpected side-effect of altering the tty modes of
commands run via ""fish -c command"" or ""fish scriptname"". This change fixes
that; albeit incompletely. The correct solution is to unconditionally set
shell tty modes if stdin is attached to a tty and restore the appropriate
modes whenever an external command is run -- regardless of the path used to
run the external command. The proper fix should be done as part of addressing
issues #2315 and #1041.

Increase the delay between seeing an escape character and giving up on
whether additional characters that match a key binding are seen. I'm
setting the value to 500 ms to match the readline library. We don't need
such a large window for sequences transmitted by a terminal (even over ssh
where network delays can be a problem).  However, we can't expect humans to
reliably press the escape key followed by another key with an inter-char
delay of less than ~250 ms based on my testing and research. A value of
500 ms provides a nice experience even for people using ""fish_vi_mode""
bindings as a half second to switch from insert to normal mode is still
fast enough that most people won't even notice.

While investigating issue #2619 my first thought was that the problem
had something to do with the ""is_interactive_session"" global variable.
That preliminary conclusion appears to be wrong (i.e., the problem
lies elsewhere). However, that hypothesis caused me to look at function
""fish_parse_opt"" and other mentions of ""is_interactive_session"".

I decided to take the opportunity to simplify and improve the style of
""fish_parse_opt"" since I just spent an hour reviewing the code that
references ""is_interactive_session"". For example, the ""has_cmd"" variable
isn't really needed. And there is inconsistent whitespace not to mention
confusion about bool's versus int's and zero versus NULL."

background colors compared to the non-bright variants.

This also fixes a bug in so far as palette number 7 is actually grey and
not white whereas palette number 15 is white. At least on the terminal
emulators on which I've tested this change (Ubuntu xterm & uxterm, Mac
OS X Terminal & iTerm2).

We identify when the universal variable file has changed out from under us by
comparing a bunch of fields from its stat: inode, device, size, high-precision
timestamp, generation. Linux aggressively reuses inodes, and the size may be
the same by coincidence (which is the case in the tests). Also, Linux
officially has nanosecond precision, but in practice it seems to only uses
millisecond precision for storing mtimes. Thus if there are three or more
updates within a millisecond, every field we check may be the same, and we are
vulnerable to the ABA problem. I believe this explains the occasional test
failures.

The solution is to manually set the nanosecond field of the mtime timestamp to
something unlikely to be duplicated, like a random number, or better yet, the
current time (with nanosecond precision). This is more in the spirit of the
timestamp, and it means we're around a million times less likely to collide.
This seems to fix the tests."

arguably surprising, since a 'set -l' in a function, followed
by a 'set -ql' in a child block, would fail. There was also no
way to check for a function-scoped variable, since omitting the
scope would also pull in global variables.

We could revisit this and introduce an explicit function scope.

Add new functions path_get_data and path_create_data which parallel existing

Modify history_filename to use the new function path_get_data.

not XDG_CONFIG_HOME.

Note that these changes mirror what is already used in
fish-shell/share/tools/create_manpage_completions.py, which stores the
completions in XDG_DATA_HOME

This change matches recommendations in the xdg basedir spec at
http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.7.html

1. Don't put history in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME (closes #744)

2. Fish is placing non-config files in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME #1257

    Make overriding cnf-handler work

    Do this by renaming the __fish_command_not_found_handler used during
    startup to __fish_startup_command_not_found_handler. That allows us to
    check if __fish_command_not_found_handler has been defined and skip the
    setup of the normal one.

    Now disabling cnf-handling can be done via defining an empty

There are two main problems in the existing Fossil autocompletion that this
patch solves:

  * Because Fossil lacks an alias system similar to those in Hg and Git,
    wrapper scripts are common, and aliasing them to `fossil` is also fairly
    common. The lack of the `command fossil` pattern in the completions script
    meant that the actual fossil command might not be called, but rather the
    alias. This problem has been fixed by introducing a __fish_fossil command,
    similar to the __fish_hg and __fish_git commands in those completion shells,
    that does this, and converting all explicit fossil calls in the completion
    script to use __fish_fossil instead
  * Because there's now a centralized location for calling Fossil, I also moved
    all of the repetitive stderr redirects that function.

This results in more robust and cleaner code."

Notification is sent using an OSC 777 escape sequence as described at
http://known.phyks.me/2014/local-notifications-for-weechat-and-urxvt.
The specific notification is crafted to match that emitted by bash
when running under Fedora 22 with the ""vte-profile"" RPM installed.
See the code for ""__vte_prompt_command"" starting at
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/vte291.git/tree/vte291-command-notify.patch#n307
to see exactly what bash produces.  My approach is, however, a bit
more paranoid about control characters embedded in commands.

Gnome-terminal 3.16 responds to this escape sequence by posting a
desktop notification if the containing terminal window does not have
focus.  This lets the user know that a long-running background command
has completed.  Job notification is promoted as a Fedora 22 feature
(http://fedoramagazine.org/terminal-job-notifications-in-fedora-22-workstation/),
so it would be good for fish users to be benefit from it.

Conversely, anyone who does not want this feature can use ""functions
--erase __notify_vte_command_completed"" to turn it off."

Prior to this fix, a child process may be reaped in one of two ways:
1. By a call to waitpid() within job_continue
2. By a call to waitpid() within the SIGCHLD signal handler

Only the second call was with the WNOHANG option. Thus if the signal
handler fired first, and then the waitpid call fired, we could get a
deadlock because we'd end up waiting on a long-running process. I have
not been able to reproduce this on fish 1.x, though it seems like it
ought to reproduce there too.

This fix migrates the waitpid() call out of the signal handler; the
second class of calls moves to job_reap. This eliminates the possibility
of a race, because we check for job completion before calling waitpid,
and there is no longer the possibility of the job being marked as
complete asynchronously. It also results in a massive conceptual
simplification, since the signal handler is now very simple and easy to
reason about (no more walking jobs lists, etc).

Wildcard errors are only reported interactively, and they're also not
really errors. Commands with multiple wildcards would in fact continue
executing if at least one wildcard matched, which is quite surprising.
But they would report an error if there is only one wildcard in the
arguments list and the wildcard has no match, even if there are other
remaining arguments.

Given this inconsistency, and given that sh does not stop execution if a
wildcard fails to match, it seems better to allow execution to continue.
This is better from a scripting perspective anyway, as it means
constructs like `set -l paths foo/*.txt` will actually create the
variable (with an empty value) instead of skipping the `set`
altogether and perhaps causing subsequent code to read or modify a
global or universal variable."

This makes two changes to parse trees:

1. Unmaterialized nodes no longer have an invalid source location
For example, with the code `while false;end` there are no tokens
associated with the while loop's job_list, and therefore it is
unmaterialized. Previously it would have had a SOURCE_OFFSET_INVALID.
But now it has a zero source length, but an offset equal to the end of
the while loop (i.e. the semicolon), and a zero length. Correspondingly,
the has_source function now checks the length instead of the offset.

2. Special (comment and error) nodes have always been ""disconnected,""
meaning they are not the child of any other node. However, they now have
their parent offsets set to whatever the top of the node stack was when
the node was encountered. This gives us a sense of which node the
comment is ""in"", e.g. if we are constructing a job list then the
comment's parent will be the job list. This lets us determine the
comment's indent."

The screen size is fetched after a SIGWINCH is delivered. The current
implementation has two issues:

* It calls ioctl() from the SIGWINCH signal handler, despite ioctl() not
  being a function that is known to be safe to call.
* It's not thread-safe.

Signals can be delivered on arbitrary threads, so we don't know if it's
actually safe to be modifying the cached winsize in response to a
signal. It's also plausible that the winsize may be requested from a
background thread.

To solve the first issue, we twiddle a volatile boolean flag in the
signal handler and defer the ioctl() call until we actually request the
screen size.

To solve the second issue, we introduce a pthread rwlock around the
cached winsize. A rwlock is used because it can be expected that there
are likely to be far more window size reads than window size writes. If
we were using C++11 we could probably get away with atomics, but since
we don't have that (or boost), a rwlock should suffice.

Fixes #1613."

When a key is bound to a fish function, if that function invokes
`commandline`, it gets a stale copy of the commandline. This is because
any keys passed to `self-insert` (the default) don't actually get added
to the commandline until a special character is processed, such as the
R_NULL that gets returned after running a binding for a fish command.

To fix this, don't allow fish commands to be run for bindings if we're
processing more than one key. When a key wants to invoke a fish command,
instead we push the invocation sequence back onto the input, followed by
an R_NULL, and return. This causes the input loop to break out and
update the commandline. When it starts up again, it will re-process the
keys and invoke the fish command.

This is primarily an issue with pasting text that includes bound keys in
it. Typed text is slow enough that fish will update the commandline
between each character.

---

I don't know of any way to write a test for this, but the issue can be
reproduced as follows:

    > bind _ 'commandline -i _'

This binds _ to a command that inserts _. Typing the following works:

    > echo wat_is_it

But if you copy that line and paste it instead of typing it, the end
result looks like

    > _echo wat_isit

With this fix in place, the pasted output correctly matches the typed
output."

expand_variables() is slightly confused about how to handle last_idx. On
input, it expects it to be the index to start processing at, but when
called recursively it always passes the current index. This means that
it may sometimes pass an index 1 past the end of the input string.
Notably, that happens when typing something like

> echo ""$foo

(where ""foo"" is any string that is not a prefix of some existing
variable name)

Fix this by explicitly defining last_idx as being the last processed
index, meaning the next index to process is actually last_idx-1. This
means we should call it with next.size() instead of next.size()-1."

Double expansions of variables had the following issues:

* `""$$foo""` threw an error no matter what the value of `$foo` was.
* `set -l foo ''; echo $$foo` threw an error because of the expansion of
  `$foo` to `''`.

With this change, double expansion always works properly. When
double-expanding a multi-valued variable, in a double-quoted string the
first word of the inner expansion is used for the outer expansion, and
outside of a quoted string every word is used for the double-expansion
in each of the arguments.

    > set -l foo bar baz
    > set -l bar one two
    > set -l baz three four
    > echo ""$$foo""
    one two baz
    > echo $$foo

Add the --wraps option to 'complete' and 'function'. This allows a
command to (recursively) inherit the completions of a wrapped command.
Fixes #393.

When evaluating a completion, we inspect the entire ""wrap chain"" for a
command, i.e. we follow the sequence of wrapping until we either hit a
loop (which we silently ignore) or the end of the chain. We then
evaluate completions as if the wrapping command were substituted with
the wrapped command. Currently this only works for commands, i.e.
'complete --command gco --wraps git\ checkout' won't work (that would
seem to encroaching on abbreviations anyways). It might be useful to
show an error message for that case.

The commandline builtin reflects the commandline with the wrapped
command substituted in, so e.g. git completions (which inspect the
command line) will just work. This sort of command line munging is
also performed by 'complete -C' so it's not totally without precedent.

'alias will also now mark its generated function as wrapping the
'target."

In the new mode (not yet enabled), universal variables are set by reading and writing the fishd file directly, with some file locking for synchronization. This enables forwards and backwards compatibility. However there is no compatibility with simultaneous edits. Changes may be lost if fishd and the new mechanisms both attempt writes.

fishd is still enabled by default for now; it will be disabled in a future commit. You can opt into the new mechanism (disabling fishd) by setting the environment variable fish_use_fishd to 0 before starting fish. This cannot itself be a universal variable, because of bootstrapping: the value is needed to determine how we read universal variables in the first place.

Universal variable change notifications (i.e. reacting immediately to live edits) are tricky. Checking for changes is simple and relatively inexpensive (just a stat()), but relying solely on that would require frequent wakeups, and show up in fs_usage. So how do we get change notifications into an fd that we can monitor via select()? We support a few strategies, expressed as universal_notifier_t::notifier_strategy_t. By default we use notifyd on OS X and a named pipe on Linux / everywhere else. This is also configurable at runtime via the fish_universal_notifier variable."

This change replaces fish's execution model, and obviates much of
parser_t. Instead of parsing fish code into a sequence of
commands-arguments, this reifies syntactic constructs into a grammar,
builds a parse tree, and executes that. This provides a big
simplification and (sometimes) performance boost. fish while loops
become C++ while loops, etc.

There are some known regressions in error reporting, which ought to be
fixed in the soon-to-be-merged parser_cleanup branch. There's also
legitimate changes in edge cases. For example, `command builtin ...` now
executes a command called ""builtin"" instead of doing something else
weird. The most significant change is that syntactic elements must be
unexpected: for example, single quoting 'command' will now cause it to
not be recognized. This should be fixed soon.

Please open issues for any regressions you find!"

The parser here is a LL(2) parser, which is handwritten (to avoid complicating the build process and to maintain good control over error reporting, thread safety, etc). Later it's worth exploring using parser generators (lemon, etc) or other tools to simplify things.

This commit enables the new parser for syntax highlighting, completions, and abbreviations. Syntax highlighting retains the old implementation (disabled), which will be removed shortly. There is also support for a new execution model, based on the new parser, but it is disabled by default (can be enabled by setting the fish_new_parser variable to 1).

There's also lots of new tests, and some machinery for selecting which tests to run.

After living on this commit for a while, we'll enable the new execution model by default, and then begin to tear down the machinery of the old one (the block types, builtin_end, the parser_t junk, etc.). After that we can pursue even more exotic execution models, like multithreaded ones.

(The branch name is really a misnomer - the tree here is a parse tree, or concrete syntax tree, not an abstract one.)

Fixes #557"

1. Use Bash-like expansion for empty searches (when you just use a '%' by
itself).

'%' will now *only* match the last valid backgrounded process.
If there are no such processes, an expansion error will be generated.

'%' by itself would previously match either *all* backgrounded
processes, or failing that, all processes owned by your user. If you
ever tried to run `kill -9 %`, it would either kill all backgrounded
processes or *all* of your processes. I'm not sure why anyone would ever
want that to be a single keystroke away. You could almost typo it.

As a result, `fg %`, `bg %`, `kill %`, etc will all operate on the last
process touched by job control.

2. Don't run 'by-name' matches when the search term is numeric.

This prevents you from running a command like `kill %1` and accidentally
killing a process named something like ""1Command"". Overloaded behavior
can be dangerous, and we probably shouldn't play fast and loose with
expansion characters that generate process IDs."

In fish 1.x and 2.0.0, the redirections for a process were flattened into a big list associated with the job, so there was no way to tell which redirections applied to each process. Each process therefore got all the redirections associated with the job. See  https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/877 for how this could manifest.

With this change, jobs only track their block-level redirections. Process level redirections are correctly associated with the process, and at exec time we stitch them together (block, pipe, and process redirects).

This fixes the weird issues where redirects bleed across pipelines (like #877), and also allows us to play with the order in which redirections are applied, since the final list is constructed right before it's needed.

Since set_color was changed to a built-in command, the entire shell will
exit in the event that setupterm() fails for some reason since ncurses
does an exit() if an errret was not passed in.

setupterm() can fail if the TERM environment variable is not set. This can
cause the shell to die prematurely if set_color is called from a startup
file like config.fish (such as vi-mode.fish which caches the results of
set_color when it is loaded) and fish is started without a TERM set
(e.g. when started from .xsession, or when being used as a remote shell
by a command such as rsync, scp or git)

A simple repro case for this issue is:

ian@delenn~ [i]> echo set_color normal > ~/.config/fish/config.fish
ian@delenn~ [i]> scp localhost:test .
TERM environment variable not set.
ian@delenn~ [i]>

This patch passes in an errret variable to setupterm(), which causes
ncurses to return the error to builtin_set_color() rather than calling
exit():

ian@delenn~ [i]> scp localhost:test .
test                                                 100%    0     0.0KB/s   00:00

The compiled-in path to bin dir was not correct; it made the
common assumption that `$(prefix)` == `$(prefix)/bin` which is
usually true, but not in all cases.

1. [machine specific files](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html#index-exec_005fprefix)
   should use `$(exec_prefix)` (`@exec_prefix@` in Makefile.in)
   instead of the usual `$(prefix)`.

2. [executable programs](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html#index-bindir)
   should use the more-specific `$(bindir)` (`@bindir@` in Makefile.in)
   instead of assuming `$(exec_prefix)/bin` as this allows the
   executable install location to be changed with the
   `--bindir=_foo_` option to `./configure`.

Fortunately, the makefile is mostly correct and *installs* the
executable in the correct location. The problem shows up later
such as during tab-completion, when fish_pager is run - the
compiled-in path it uses was the incorrect `$(prefix)/bin`
resulting in an ""Unknown command"" error, which only required
this small fix."

After updating, fish would immediately die when started in an xterm from
my window manager (wmii) with a message like:

fish: builtin.cpp:3357: int builtin_end(parser_t&, wchar_t**): Assertion `false' failed.
fish: Job 1, “~/code/fish-shell/fish” terminated by signal SIGABRT (Abort)

Starting fish from an existing shell worked, and running it on other
machines that I was only SSHing into worked as well. I did discover that
on one machine starting git from one specific directory
(/home/ian/bml/kernel) would cause this failure, but starting from any
other directory worked as normal. I'm not entirely sure what
circumstances contribute to this failure - starting from a copy of the
kernel directory works fine.

The failure only started with the following commit, which introduced the
assert(false):

commit d788c844408d25eb5f986d8c6e2b609270dbc153
Made type property of block_t constant and private
Further work towards cleaning up block_t hierarchy

Looking at this fail in gdb:

(gdb) r

(gdb) p parser.current_block->type()
$1 = FAKE

So this happens when we run an end command for a FAKE block.

The below patch adds an empty case for FAKE blocks to avoid hitting the
assert. I would need to study the code in more detail to understand if
we should even be executing this code if we are in a FAKE block, but
this patch seems to solve the issue for me.

The __fish_git_prompt_show_upstream helper function was inadvertently
looking at the misnamed variable __fish_git_prompt_show_upstream in some
cases, including when implementing the bash.showUpstream override.
Fixing the script to use __fish_git_prompt_showupstream triggered an
infinite loop because the --on-variable hook does not distinguish
between local and global variables.

Update the script to set a completely different local variable to
__fish_git_prompt_showupstream and to override this local variable for
bash.showUpstream.

Also update the code that looks at bash.showUpstream to also read
bash.showupstream, because the bash script appears to have a bug where
it looks for bash.showupstream despite documenting bash.showUpstream."

The builtin function returns the raw status, which is not the same as
the integer return by waitpid. Therefore, the WIF macros shouldn't be
used for checking or obtaining the status.

This bug can be seen by executing (eval false). The builtin eval
function returns 1, but proc_format_status misinterprets it as a signal
by checking WIFSIGNALED, so adds 128 to the status to return 129.

installed directly into ${prefix}/share/doc instead within a fish

I also added datarootdir to fix an autoconf warning,  since autoconf
normally would use it for the directory paths (e.g. docdir =
${datarootdir}/doc/${PACKAGE_TARNAME}). The autoconf generated configure

Aim is to allow an existing function to be renamed, allowing some basic function chaining.

Hello

> foo
fish: Unknown command 'foo'
> bar
Hello
> functions --rename fish_prompt old_prompt
