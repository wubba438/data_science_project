When ""Append domain names to the host"" setting is set to ""No"",
Foreman won't append the domain name to the host after
provisioning so host.name will remain as short name. Without
this patch, user cannot create/update a lookup value with
matcher fqdn=host.domain.com because it will fail with
validation error. The reason that it failed to validate is
Foreman uses the host.name(shortname) to find for existing host
that matches ""host.domain.com"" which will never match.
This patch fixed the issue."

this patch introduce a docker file and docker compose example
so that developers can easily get a production docker based env
working quickly.

this by no means is a replacement to the installer or should
effect users besides the porpose of getting up an environment quickly

this does not try to solve docker problems for plugins (but it
can be used to build customized images with a custom plugin installed).

to test this pr you would need docker and docker-compose (I'm running docker-compose-1.22.0-2.)

to use this PR:
(install docker-compose)

docker-compose run app bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
docker-compose up

in order to build your own docker image you can either use a service
(such as quay.io) tiggered by a git push or manually OR
to install a recent version of docker that supports multi-stage builds

in theory podman also supports it, but i had stability issues with it
while trying to build images."

This commit adds the `-W 0` to ruby for foreman-rake

This will silence warnings for ruby. We already use the production
rails environment, which prevents rails warnings, but we don't alter
the logging for ruby, so ruby warnings are still visible

Here is the option in the ruby help menu:
```
  -W[level=2]     set warning level; 0=silence, 1=medium, 2=verbose

This can be reproduced in Katello production environments, where
there are currently ruby warnings."

for example in foreman-tasks). As a result, this feature has been broken

auto_complete_search is actually defined, so that we detect the missing
path sooner."

When loading the manifest.json from a plugin we need to include plugin

bc486dd62734be908cd3f95da1352cc1944eb34b attempted to make it possible
to create additional bundles.  202c65d0efc0345b883ba6d1e70aedc90b3d5294
then configured webpack to actually compile the bundle during build.
This completes the chain by loading it in the actual manifest so you can
use it in a production build where the development server isn't present."

The problem with registered hosts report is that for each host we load
all host facts just in order to display kernelrelease fact value. We
can define explicit association for this fact so we can `:include` it.
To use it in templates a new macro `host_kernel_release` is introduced."

Ruby code uses .mo files for the translations, but JS code uses a
generated JSON file containing the translation dictionary.
When generating the .mo file, fuzzy translations are ignored, but
when generating the json dictionary they are not.

Because en is the source locale, pulling translations from transifex
does not pull the English translation and thus the fuzzy translations
remain and are not removed when updating the translations.

This commit only removes the fuzzy translations, so on the next
translation update the json files will be generated correctly without
the wrong translations."

* Fixes #20118 - display error instead of NilClass

In some scenarios when editing a host in Foreman, the VM may not
exist in VMware anymore, e.g. was deleted or uuid is missing.
The host is handled as a new VM, but cannot be saved.

In this case, an error message should be shown.

* display failure message in case `compute_attributes` are missing
* add unit tests to check `setCompute`
* add integration test to check alert is displayed

* Fixes #20118 - return not found in ajax method

Instead of a NilClass error a not found status
is returned in case no compute resource is found
in the Ajax method `compute_resource_selected`.

Previously, `requires_foreman_plugin` did not account for prerelease
versions, so if you required Katello 3.8 or later, Katello 3.10
prerelease would not satisfy the requirement.

This commit adds a `allow_prerelease` parameter which is enabled by
default. When set to true, prerelease versions are acceptable for
version matching.

For example:

```ruby
requires_foreman_plugin 'katello', '>= 3.8.0'

requires_foreman_plugin 'katello', '>= 3.8.0', true
```"

In Katello, we use concurrent-ruby to kick off a bunch of Net::HTTP
requests, but unfortunately what happens is we quickly run out of
connections from the database pool. After banging my head against this
for a while, and trying all kinds of crazy things like wrapping the
Setting accesses in a mutex - it occured to me that this code isn't
causing the connection to be returned to the pool automationally since
we're outside of ActiveRecord. It takes some time for connection to be
reclaimed.

By wrapping this in a with_connection block, the connection is returned
to the pool immediately when done and allows Foremans' monkey patching

Version 8 of Arm architecture defined 64-bit execution state called
AArch64. RedHat-based distributions (and GNU tools) use ""aarch64"" name
for it, but Debian went (as Linux kernel) with ""arm64"" string. This
introduced the same ""schism"" as happened with ""x86_64"" and ""arm64""
and has to be handled by Debian-related routines.

This change adds handling of the arm64 case in media URL generation
patch, transforming the ""arch"" variable strings from ""aarch64"" to
""arm64"" and reverses the operation for facts parsing.

There's no need to use global substitution for variables transformation

when rendering the factChart modal the number of hosts is

However, if factChart is rendered before the data arrives

During the process of moving Hardware Models to a React page
the current API was missing significant details that are rendered
in the Backend before the page is sent to the user.

For example, whether the user is allowed to edit a model or not

This information should be moved to the API because in the new
page, once the page is rendered by Rails any communication is
going to be done through the API and by that Rails won't
render the page or part of it again.

This commit improves on the fix in 01809199 which has been found to
cause significant performance regressions. It also adds several other
improvements to the API scope performance, the most significant one
being only checking that the scope work in `parent_scope` rather than
loading all of it into an in-memory array which can be very heavy.

The original fix was needed because of a bug in the way Rails merges
scopes, which will be fixed in Rails 5.2 by
https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/29413. Once we upgrade to Rails 5.2
the workaround can be removed since it still comes with worse

This happens when you're visiting the index page. The helper relies on
'@audit' to generate some of the audits. This does not work, since
@audit is only set when you view the details page of an audit.

For this reason, as an example changing fields of a host with
associations, like the puppet proxy, does not show the proper value in
the index, but it does show the proper value on the details page.

See the issue in Redmine for a reproduced with Katello sync plans."

This is resurrect of

https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/pull/2171/files

The old patch did not pass review because I was unable to explain the
motivation. The reason for the fallback is that only cloud compute
resources usually provide IP addresses but virtualization do not. Our
users often associate finish templates with libvirt or VMWare but it
does not work at all. This only applies to externally managed networks
where we don't know the IP (no reservation made by Foreman).

Now there is a question of safety, with incorrect DNS setup, Foreman
could run finish script on incorrect server. Therefore I am sending this
patch for discussion - I think I could make this behavior an opt-it via
setting."

Foreman HasManyCommon concern uses 'id' as a value of last resort for

here in Katello:

Where's that coming from?

GitHub uses a library called Licensee to identify a project's license
type. It shows this information in the status bar and via the API if it
can unambiguously identify the license.

This commit modifies LICENSE so that it begins with the full text of
the GPL 3.0 license. The text that was previously at the beginning of
LICENSE has been moved to the relevant section of the README, which has
been renamed to ""Licensing"". At the bottom of the ""Licensing"" section,
there is a note that mentions to the reader that they can reference
LICENSE to see the full text of not only the GPL 3.0 license, but also
all licenses related to Foreman's dependencies.

Collectively, these changes allow Licensee to successfully identify the
license type of Foreman as GPL 3.0.

Any changes to the code locally will kick in rails's auto loading which
in turn will then reload all relevant classes, and in the case of
changing a model inheriting from ApplicationRecord, then
ApplicationRecord be reloaded. So since ApplicationRecord was being
extended from within the initializer for audit then it will load the
extend however the module with still be hanging around, causing rails
throw an argument error: 'A copy of
AuditAssociations::AssociationsDefinitions has been removed from the
module tree but is still active!'.

Also note, audit_associations needs to be required because at the time
of app start up during initialization the audit_associations has not yet
been loaded. See the config/application.rb for the loading order and one
can see that models are loaded long before the audit_associations."

Currently, the cloud-init integration supports only a sub-set of
cloud-init commands. With `custom_script` support, one can pass
arbitrary cloud-init yaml to the managed host and make sure
the provisioned host will get it unchanged (which is not the case
when passing the user data currently, as the rbovirt parses into
ovirt-specific keys)

After the change, we would pass the cloud-init template to the ovirt as
is via `custom_script` ovirt functionality, and it would get to the
cloud-init directly, without any ovirt pre-processing.

The original commit meant to remove deprecation notices, and I believe
its intent was to change :only_path to :ignore_query to remove the
deprecation from the test output. In the end by mistake it was merged
just removing the :only_path option, which broke dashboard tests.
:ignore_query is the new equivalent of the :only_path option, which
makes tests pass again and does not produce any deprecation warnings"

* Replace deprecated only_path with ignore_query

* Don't log to stdout for skipped tests

~~* Don't override capture~~

~~While this code might be helpful for debugging, leaving it in for~~
~~every test run clutters up the test report.~~

* Always use the current logger in EnsureNotUsedBy

By assigning the logger to an ivar here, it gets evaluated once and
stays around for the entire lifetime of the application. If the logdev
gets closed (as it is in the test suite), it will generate a
warning. This change ensures that messages will always get written to
the current log.

* Don't let Rake make file utils verbose in tests

Rake wraps file utils, making them verbose and hence printing their
commands to stdout. Doing so adds a lot of noise to the test report,
so we can set verbose to `false` in the context of the test task."

there's a problem - the 'testables' table gets removed before the

- Some tests are removing all plugins (plugin_test, rabl_test,
belongs_to_proxy_test) from the registry. This has, among others,
one important consequence: the plugin permissions are removed.

- Take an example. Foreman Ansible overrides the Host#form with a
list of 'Ansible Roles' to choose.

- When the view for this Host#form is rendered (e.g: a
HostController or HostJSTest), the list of 'Ansible Roles' has
also to be rendered.

- Since a previous test removed the plugin from the
`Foreman::Plugin.all` registry, but the plugin is still installed
as a Rails Engine, the overrides by deface still apply.

- Some tests that render the Host form fail to run as rendering is
impossible without the 'ansible_roles' permission. These
permissions are only loaded in tests if the plugin is registered
in Foreman::Plugin*"

passwords to break. This PR refactors password auditing, so that instead

record the string `[redacted]` instead of any actual password.
The change is done currently in our audit extensions, which mean that it
will now apply to all resources that have a `password` attribute instead
of just those that have defined the workaround.
The next step will be to move this to the audited gem in a more
generalized method that can be defined in the model when initializing
audited, so that the workaround can be removed."

* Fixes #20931 - unify parameters and templates renderer

Before this patch, we used separate renderer for the parameters. This
caused issues when introducing more dsl methods for the templates that
we want to use in the parameters as well. Also, by the time of writing
the original SafeRenderer, there was no Renderer available.

After doing so, I was hitting issue with recursion, as
`Renderer.host_param` was using `@host.params` while the @host.params
was trying to render the params, that could include the `host_param`
call again, which lead to endless loop. After simplifying the
`HostParams` methods, it is possible to achieve this.

I also noticed that we were rendering only the inherited params and not
the non-inherited once. I've fixed this bug also as part of this patch.

Last but not least, due to the fact that we were using the

Audits table queries cause high load in large deployments.

Foreman regularly does queries like this:
SELECT MAX(`audits`.`version`) AS max_id FROM `audits`  WHERE `audits`.`auditable_id` = 7555 AND `audits`.`auditable_type` = 'LookupKey';

On large deployments with huge audits tables, this looks like this and results in everything taking a very long time:
+--------+
| max_id |
+--------+
| 117292 |
+--------+
1 row in set (13.44 sec)

A simple solution to this, is to include the version in the compound index, which stops mysql from having to go to the table at all, and turns the same query into this:

+--------+
| max_id |
+--------+
| 117292 |

* Fixes #21343 - support multiple orgs supported for non-admins

This adds a full support for taxonomies in API for non-admin users. It
fixes the issue with dirty associations module that only track _ids
change. It also makes the nil a valid value for organization_id and
location_id parameters which set ""Any context"" explictly, so user can
override default context to any. Finally it updates the org admin role
to have permissions to see and edit organizations. That required an
enforcement of taxonomies that are being set as parent as well as
taxonomy filters being searchable by taxonomy_id. So the filter for
e.g. organzations can be correctly scoped for org admin too."

""any context"" for API calls. This also refactors various places
where tried to set the right taxonomy and combines them into single
one. This makes API requests work for org admins with single org.

default organization and location. This is as consistent with UI

After upgrade from Rails 4.1 to Rails 4.2 there was significant
drop on rails startup in production. I have tracked it down to
several changes in Rails, but it might also be affected by the
fact the we use the url_helpers on more places than older Foreman
versions.

The reason of the slowness is the `define_method` calls on a module for
every named route we have. The `define_method` is more expensive
the more classes include the module that gets the new method.

The solution of this problem is to load the routes before we
load the controllers (including the eager loading) so that the modules
get defined new methods before the controllers include it in their code.

The original after_finalize loading is still here, but should not get
run again, as it callse `execute_if_updated` and nothing new usually
gets updated there.

To test, one can try in devel setup:

    time echo exit | bundle exec rails c production

or in production:

    service httpd restart; time curl -k https://localhost

In devel setup, I got from 30s to 10s, in production with Katello
and other plugins (it gets more and more visible with more plugins
around), I got from 1m 15s to 15s.

Please not `foreman-rake console` is not affected, as the rake
environment turns off the eager loading."

In #18618, the initialization code was moved from foreman-tasks to

initialization of dynflow world was moved directly to the time
`Rails.application.dynflow` was called. This is not right, as there are
situations where plugins go and call `Rails.application.dynflow.config`
before the whole stack is prepared, which leads to database connection
being opened too early, which can cause the whole lot of issues (as
we've hit currently with Katello).

At the moment, the method Hostext::OperatingSystem#template_kinds is
unable to handle image-based provisioning. If there is an image, it will
not be able to find it as 'self.compute_attributes' does not exist for
new hosts.

Creating the host always worked well, and the templates can be found
after clicking the 'submit' button. However, when you click on
'Resolve', you get an error 'undefined method []' as compute_attributes
does not exist.

This is fixed by ensuring the controller includes compute_attributes in
the 'temporary' host created to check the templates this.

To reproduce:

 - Click on Hosts > New host
 - Select a Compute Resource
 - Select an OS, choose 'Image based' as provisioning method
 - Select an image
 - Click on 'Resolve' - you will see ""No templates were configured""
 - After applying the patch, you should see the finish/userdata template"

The current value of resolve.modules in config/webpack.config.js is
""path.join....'node_modules'"""".
This value doesn't work when dependencies have been installed using
global style (npm install --global-style true).

In this style, which is what foreman-packaging uses, dependencies of
dependencies get nested like:

node_modules/dependencyA/node_modules/dependencyB

in a tree like structure. foreman-packaging needs to install in this
mode because the npm cache is stored
like a tree.

The solution I've been given in #webpack is to use a string
'node_modules' instead of path.join. The reason is that
webpack purposefully looks for nested dependencies in that case, but not
if you provide the full path."

Filters cannot have many resource_types - each filter needs to have its
own resource type, e.g: one filter does not accommodate permissions for
""Host"" and ""DiscoveredHost"".

This is enforced by a validator in the model, but our fixtures are able
to completely skip it. The result is that plugins have Filters with
multiple resource types.

This has not been a problem until recently, as we added a test that
checks that the db filter cache can be recreated (CacheManagerTest).
On plugins, this test fails to pass as fixtures are
wrongly created.

To reproduce, make sure your test DB is either Postgres or MySQL, add a
plugin (like foreman_discovery), and try to run the CacheManagerTest"

* fixes #18512 - support sprockets-rails 3.x

The app.assets environment is no longer always configured, and instead
is only configured when the regular Rails environment is loaded. Loading
only the 'assets' group initializers isn't sufficient.

Because the asset group initializers are no longer run, the plugin API
has been extended with `precompile_assets` and `automatic_assets` to
store and optionally generate a list of assets for that plugin. It
deprecates using an assets initializer, modifying SETTINGS and
`config.assets.precompile` to configure the plugin asset list.

* fixes #18500 - replace quiet_assets with sprockets-rails flag

quiet_assets was merged into sprockets-rails 3.1+ and is no longer
maintained for Rails 5, so it can be removed. Min version hasn't been
increased as it only affects development log verbosity and isn't a hard
dependency. Older versions used in packages will work fine.

The logging gem deliberately doesn't implement the #silence method, so
this is wrapped to fully match the Rails API and make the feature work."

1. SETTINGS[:rails] is loaded pre-Rails boot, then post-boot the
   majority of the SETTINGS are loaded depending on the environment.
   settings.yaml.dist will allow packagers to override the default
   version of Rails loaded to match their distribution.
2. rails-controller-testing, record_tag_helper replace extracted Rails
   4.x features.
3. ParamsParser middleware is no longer loaded by default and is

You can have a network interface with an ipv6 subnet configured but

Prior to this commit:
Foreman plugins like Katello/Discovery extended the Host edit page
and added fields of their own.
For example
Katello adds things like Content Views, enviroments etc.

However they were unable to get their attibutes passed to the backend
because the os_selected and other ""*_selected""  methods do something
like
attrs = attribute_hash(['operatingsystem_id', 'organization_id',
                        'location_id']);
sending a hard coded list. This makes it impossible for plugins to send
more data when things like OS or Medium or image get selected.

This commit does the following:

Updates the Host edit js's os_select and other functions
to use a globally available map to figure out which attributes to
send to the server when one calls ""medium_selected"" ""os_selected"" etc.

This will help plugins like Katello and foreman-discovery extend the
global map and add their parameters.

For example all katello would have to do now is to say something like
window.tfm.hosts.registerPluginAttributes('os', [""content_view_id""])
and when os gets selected these attributes will be automatically
get sent to server."

Partially reverts 70ce8fe to reinstate autoload_once_paths as the
preferred way to load registry-type objects with class variables
containing data set up during app initialisation (e.g. plugin
registrations, menu items.)

autoload_once is compatible with using require_dependency, which is
preferred to allow Rails to track which constants are loaded, so eager
loading doesn't ever try to load the same file twice (7923c95.)

This moves all registry-type objects to app/registries/ and marks this
path as being autoload_once. The contents of this directory should be
kept at an absolute minimum to ease development."

This introduces a way of exporting tables from the UI to CSV.
There are 3 steps to adding a CSV export to a table:

1. Add the CsvResponder concern to the relevant controller.
2. Add a `format.csv` block to the index controller action. This block
should include a call to `csv_response` with the wanted resources.
3. Add `csv_link` to the title actions. (Or wherever you want the export
button to appear)

By default, the csv will include all columns that exist for that model
in the database, except for the `created_at` and `updated_at` ones. To
override the default, add a method `csv_columns` to the controllers that
returns an array of columns. Columns can be actual column names in the
database, reflections, or any method that can be called on an instance
of the model.

This commit also includes an example of the feature implemented on the
Hosts index page."

According to this bug [1] multipart form data is malformed if there
are fields without names. It been solved within Edge browser, however
no solution is expected for IE10/IE11

It cause a failure with Rack - EOFError: bad content body, therefore
pages like domains and subnet create/edit cannot be submitted (and all
other forms which are submitted via ajax with multipart form data, and
an unnamed field within).

This is identical to https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/pull/4125
but moves the workaround to an own helper function and calls the
function in every submit_or_cancel invocation, thus fixing *all* forms
which use the two-pane layout.

merges the scopes more correctly/effectively than 4.2, and so invisible
resources became visible through the association getter.

Like the case where there is at least one visible resource, a string SQL
fragment is used instead to prevent it being overridden by ActiveRecord.

environment was nil (since hostgroup#environment now returns nil due to

If the user is scoped to taxonomy ""A"", ""Host.count"" will only return
hosts in that taxonomy. That is correct. However there is a usecase
where we want to display the hosts count regardless of the current
taxonomy.

The table for locations and organizations was showing the ""Host.count""
scoped to the current taxonomy, so it would show 0 everywhere but in the
current taxonomy.

The fix is to make the helper aware of this issue, and show the unscoped
Host.count when displaying the organizations/locations table"

In this scenario:

1. User has one organization - ""E-Corp"" - this organization allows the
user to see every hostgroup (via selecting ""all host groups"" when
editing the organization).

2. User has a location ""Czech republic"" that also includes all host
groups through that checkbox.

3. User visits /hostgroups with ""any context"" selected, or ""E-Corp/any
location"", or ""any organization/Czech republic"". The result is that the
user does not see all host groups even though there's an
organization/location combination (e-corp/czech republic) that should
allow the user to see all host groups.

---

The reason is that when `Hostgroup.taxable_ids` is called
`Organization.ignore?` does not realize that there it should look in all
Organizations to see if any of them 'ignores' (has ""all host groups""
    checked) the resource. The same thing happens with Locations.

The fix is to make `ignore?` aware the 'Organization.current == nil'
means 'Any organization', not 'No organization'."

has the problem). Simply trying to edit a filter will throw this 500

We've always had this problem , but since #16971 removed the check for
only using that method for '> 5' associations, you'd only see the error
if you had at least 6 organizations or locations (unlikely). Now it
became more apparent and it shows up every time.

The fix I've used is just to take advantage of the options hash to send
the association name directly, and if it's not set, then use
ActiveModel::Naming to get it (as usual)."

scoped_search doesn't support class inheritance with STI, so registering
definitions on the subclass fixes various issues. This fixes an issue
where scoped_search on CommonParameter calls Parameter.all and is
returned a list of CommonParameters under Rails 4.2, as it relies on a
bug (#18806) for applying the type='CommonParameter' condition when
calling Parameter.all.

On Rails 5.0, this bug was fixed and calling Parameter.all within a
scope on CommonParameter now returns all types of parameters.
Registering all scoped_search definitions on the subclasses ensures that
scoped_search calls CommonParameter.all instead.

The taxonomies API changed as it called Taxonomix objects with scopes
such as `.locations.search_for`, which no longer existed when the
scoped_search definitions were removed from Taxonomy (.locations is a
Taxonomy association with a where clause). This now explicitly searches
via the appropriate Taxonomy subclass."

When initialising a new test database, the ""permission"" directive in a
plugin registration would skip the Foreman::AccessControl mapping so
later tests using the access control lists would fail (e.g.
AccessPermissionsTest, if a route added by a plugin to the main app
engine used a plugin permission.)

The AccessControl entry is now always created as it's safe to do so even
without a database, but the Permission resource is not created from the
initialiser in the test environment. Instead, permissions, roles and
filters are added to the database via fixtures so plugins can rely on
them for unit or functional tests."

this prevented the permission from being applied properly.

small fix to the controller to check whether the BMC interface is
available before making the IPMI call - otherwise the error that Foreman

In an installation that uses taxonomies, when an user logs in for
the first time and gets its account created via LDAP, it has no
taxonomies.

This is a problem, as even if the user has all the roles it needs from
external user groups, an admin needs to manually set the taxonomies for
every new user.

This commit fixes that by assigning the taxonomies from the LDAP auth
source to the user when it logs in for the first time. It does *not*
update them on every login, as after the user has logged in, user
taxonomies are left to the Foreman administrator to manage."

Before this commit, parent_scope called 'merge' on a scope that may
contain conditions that do not make sense on 'resource_class'.

In this case, when a user with a filter :view_hosts and search
'hostgroup_fullname = foo' tried to view
api/v2/hosts/somehost/interfaces, that would not work.

The SQL generated by `scope_for` contains
`AND ((`hostgroups`.`title` = 'base'))`, which clearly cannot be
merged with the Nic::Base scope, as 'hostgroups' isn't a field in
Nic::Base.

To avoid this problem, we resolve the scope and call 'where' on the
scope ids, instead of merging the parent and the child scope.

Notice this problem exists for any child/parent relationship where the
user has a filter :view_parent , search 'parent_attribute = foo' if
parent_attribute is not defined in the child."

respond_to_missing? changed how AR handles group_by calls on

it's been removed again.

The method_missing implementation has been deprecated in favour of the
hash [] style method calls which are more idiomatic and avoids making

Doing the following:
- Create 2 smart proxies, one for dhcp/dns/tft/puppetca/puppet, another

- Create a hostgroup A that sets domain, subnet, realm, puppet_proxy,
puppet_ca_proxy
- Create a host that uses hostgroup A, but uncheck 'inherit' and
remove the 'realm' attribute. The host is created just fine with no
realm
- When I try to rebuild the host, `HostBuildStatus#check_all_statuses`
is called. This checks the host_status (OK), templates_status(OK), and
smart_proxies_status(FAIL). The host cannot be rebuilt.

The reason `smart_proxies_status` fails is that `smart_proxy_ids`
tries to find whether Realm is set.
- If it's set, it adds the proxy to 'Host#smart_proxies`
- If it's not set, it looks in the hostgroup to see if it's set there.
However, I have overridden the option, because I don't want to set a
Realm since I don't want to boot the Realm proxy I have.

Host#smart_proxies should not look in the host.hostgroup object to
retrieve values for the proxy, but instead retrieve those from itself"

On Rails 5.0, the base_class is used during model instantiation to
validate STI relationships as it now casts similarly to Foreman::STI,
causing failures when base_class returns the subclass rather than parent
class.

Removing the overriding of `base_class` in Template subclasses
necessitates changing polymorphic associations to store the base class
in the table's type field rather than the subclass name because the
has_many associations will search by `base_class`. This is recommended
by ActiveRecord when using STI with polymorphic associations:

Filtering of attributes has moved from the protected_attributes gem to
strong parameters in controller concerns, to be in line with current
Rails recommendations.

Concerns are shared between UI and both API controllers and list the
attributes using Foreman::ParameterFilter, which provides additional
features:

1. Registration of additional attributes from plugins, through the
plugin API or `attr_accessible` for short term compatibility.
2. Re-use of permitted attribute lists for nested models (e.g. host
and interface).
3. Combining of lists of attributes from all sources in a single
permit call.
4. A small DSL for changing accepted parameters based on controller,
action and UI/API type.

Plugins should either temporarily depend on protected_attributes to
continue to protect their models or call permit/use ParameterFilter
similarly: http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Strong_parameters

Some UI changes were required to make nested model hash keys all
integers instead of ""new_123456"" etc, else strong parameters would
filter the entries out.

The Role model's builtin default has been moved from initialize to the
database as the removal of protected_attrs changed the initialisation
order."

skip_orchestration and enable_orchestration were called in Host::Base
when importing facts. These two methods could not be called there
because they come from the Orchestration mixin which Host::Base does not
have. This blocked importing facts for a Host::Discovered or a Host::Base.

To test this, I've moved the tests that import the facts to a separate
test class just for Host::Base. Notice I've moved a few other tests
which also belong there. There are probably more, but I didn't want to
make this more complicated.

Lastly, Nic::Managed called lookup_value_match on save, so importing
facts didn't work for Host::Base as that method wasn't there either, so
I moved it. Same logic applies to 'setup_clone'."

When link_to generates a link on a page served from a nested controller
(e.g. foreman_example/examples) with a hash of controller/action from
our hash_for_*_path extension, it calls url_for which added the current
controller prefix to the controller name, and this wouldn't exist.

When linking to hash_for_hosts_path (`:controller => 'hosts', :action =>
'index'`), this would attempt to link to `:controller =>
'foreman_example/hosts'` instead. By returning :use_route from hash_for
as in Rails 4.1, actionpack assumes the controller name is absolute and
will not add the current controller prefix.

Rails source where relative controller is assumed by url_for if no named
route was given (the :use_route option):
https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v4.2.6/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/route_set.rb#L695-L698

This patch adds a check for this case. We also cache the operating
system data in compute resource - it saves one request + avoids
overloading logs with 404 when the operating systems are not supported
on ovirt side.

Finally, we show the information about operating systems availability
in the compute resource show page.

If somebody cached the data with ovirt 3.5 and then updates the ovirt
instance, they need to save the compute resource again to refresh the
cache."

Searching for an existing host's name without any fields
specified results in an SQL error:
missing FROM-clause entry for
table \""organizations_hosts\""

This can be reproduced using
curl -X GET -u admin 'http://localhost:3000/api/v2/
hosts?organization_id=2&search=<hostname>'

where <hostname> is an existing hostname

setting this field to explicit_only will fix the issue

My perspective of what the larger issue is:
This has to do with scoped search using AR's includes[1]
which generates a sql query with a non-existing table,
organization_hosts

This is shown on the command line

Host.includes([:location, :organization])
.where(""taxonomies.name"" => ""org1"")
.to_sql.include?(""organizations_hosts"")
evaluates to true

I am not sure about what to do for a more permanent fix,
it looks like its the same issue as

When searching hosts with free text in a taxonomy scope, if the taxonomy
has ""all smart proxies"" associated, it leads to scoped search generating
an incorrect scope which causes an invalid query:
`SELECT smart_proxies.id FROM ""smart_proxies"" ""puppet_ca_proxies_hosts""`
Making the puppet_ca search only explicitly prevents this at the cost of
not allowing to search by puppet_ca using free text. I believe this is a
reasonable tradeoff as I did not find a simpler way to handle this (might
require some deep tweeking in scoped search).
To maintain consistency I also made the puppetmaster search explicit
only."

After many hours spent on debugging I realized that the issue is that
when action view compiles the template, some lines are concatenated
together just split by "";"". This becomes problem when ERB tag contained
commentary symbol #. The reason is that when deface override is applied
it first converts the template to tree using Nokogiri (see Parser.convert).

This returns different results on different versions of underlying library.
I didn't try to compile different versions but with libxml2-2.7.6-20.el6.x86_64 and
libxslt-1.1.26-2.el6_3.1.x86_64 it does not wrap the silent erb tag with
""\n"" so as a result, this tag ends up on the same line as previous one.
The same nokogiri but on newer lib versions
(libxml2-2.9.1-5.el7_1.2.x86_64, libxslt-1.1.28-5.el7.x86_64) wrapped
it."

Parts that are contained in this PR:
1. Added extension point to API V2: Now each facet will be able to add facet's properties to host's details
2. Added model extensions, now you can enumerate all active facets using Host#facets and Host#facets_with_definitions methods

A good chunk of our unit tests are testing whether a validation is
working or not by testing it actively. For the validations we've
added ourselves I would say it's fine. However for validations that
 come from the Rails framework, we're essentially testing their job.

Instead of testing (for instance) validates(:name, :uniqueness =>
true) by creating two objects and verifying the second one won't
save (these tests are already done at the framework level), we
should simply test we're including validations in our models.

The well-maintained gem shoulda-matchers provide easy functions to
check we're including such validations, and other helpers we can
use to refactor our tests further and not test Rails functionality
twice."

The introduction of Sprockets 3+ led to the environment-version

String. The Sprockets digest method does not support digesting
classes of type ActiveSupport::StringInquirer.

This change explicitly sets the assets environment version to be
calculated the same as core assets when precompiling. When core
assets are precompiled using the normal Rails assets:precompile rake
task the environment string is generated in such a way as to create
a unique string and thus unique digest. The plugin:asset:precompile
task will now do the same and explicitly ensure it is set to

This commits upgrades Rails to Rails 4.1.5. See a description of the
changes included here, and go to the pull request in GitHub to see more
detailed explanations:

* Update gems to a Rails 4 compatible version, including dependencies
* Fix counter cache columns
* Remove conditions, order, limit from has_many relations
* Remove test runner
    On minitest 5, the runner API was deprecated, so our custom test
    runner is no longer working.

* Remove useless add_index on lookup_values match
    An index is added previously on lookup_values :priority, and on Rails 4
    rename_column changes 'priority' to 'match' already changes the name of
    the index.

* Alias assert_include to assert_includes.
* Expire topbar cache
* Subclass ApplicationMailer in test to avoid 'missing template' error
* Fixes #12021 - Use .to_param to find parent object in LookupKeys controller
    On Rails 4, .find will not default to .friendly.find so find_hostgroup,
    find_environment and find_host will fail for non numeric IDs. However, we can
    use from_param to find these objects. This is something we can do both on
    Rails 3 and Rails 4, whereas using .friendly isn't an option until friendly_id
     5.0, which depends on Rails 4.

* Use explicit friendly ID search.
* find_common finder uses from_param -> friendly -> find
    The finder needed to be refactored because with the new Friendly ID we
    have to use .friendly explicitely. It currently follows the strategy of
    searching like this:
      - from_param -> .friendly -> regular find

* Remove RecordNotFound errors from parameterizable in rails 4
* Protect attributes using attr_accessible and protected_attributes
* url_for doesn't append port when protocol is specified
    Some of our tests are checking if port 80 or 443 is included in the URL
    generated by lib/foreman/renderer.rb. However url_for has changed in
    Rails 4 and now it does not append the port even if explicitly added.

    If the protocol is specified, as it is in this case, then the url
    generated will just have the protocol (http or https) but not the port
    (80 or 443)

* Validate object instead of _id column in join tables
    On Rails 4 such validations will fail when we try to create objects
    without explicitely assigning the id.
    Puppetclass.new(:config_group => config_group) would fail even for a
    valid config group, :config_group_id => config_group.id should be used
    instead.

    To avoid that, we validate the object, not the ID column

* Rails 4 non backwards compatible syntax changes
    Changes that have to deal with how some of the internal Rails objects
    need a new syntax, like generating routes, exceptions, form builders.
    None of these are Rails 3 compatible.

* Fixes #12199 - rails 4 migration errors
    There are actually two parts to the issue of not being able to migrate
    with this branch. The first is
    https://gist.github.com/eLobato/0f5db50b5c93cc6c277c and can be
    temporarily fixed with rails/sass-rails#136 (comment) I am not sure of a
    long term fix for that atm.

    Once that is patched, this error
    https://gist.github.com/johnpmitsch/96e5ba3629890931193a happens on a
    migration. This will fix that error by changing the Migrator class
    initializer arguments which have changed from rails 3 to rails 4

* Refactor fact value test to not modify user_roles directly
* Return external usergroupsas an array
* Use eager_load to preload associations to be used in where

    temporarily fixed with rails/sass-rails#136 (comment) I am not sure of a
    long term fix for that atm.

    Once that is patched, this error
    https://gist.github.com/johnpmitsch/96e5ba3629890931193a happens on a
    migration. This will fix that error by changing the Migrator class
    initializer arguments which have changed from rails 3 to rails 4

* Refactor fact value test to not modify user_roles directly
* Return external usergroupsas an array
* Use eager_load to preload associations to be used in where
* Auto detect jenkins rake task in application.rb and set test RAILS_ENV
  in that case
* Reference previously undigested assets in CSS and js as digested using
  asset-url or image-url
* Adapted sprockets manifest.json instead of manifest.yml (ehelms)"

Problem: The regex that validates smart proxies URLs only matches
'beginning of text'. This allows us to add just \n after a valid URL and
put anything after it. For instance, javascript:alert('hacked'). I
haven't found any link to the Foreman proxy URL so the script would not
trigger, but if we were to put link_to @smart_proxy.url somewhere (or a
    plugin did this) it would be unsafe. Same problem occurrs on Medium
path.

Solution: Make the regex match the end of the URL with \Z. I substituted
the regex by an standard one, URI.regexp so we don't have to maintain it
anymore.

Extra: I added one test for this, but other tests have been rearranged
to use stubs rather than building actual SmartProxy objects &
associations."

not sure whether ruby 2.1 is at blame, but IRB's initializer tries to
use the command line arguments to decide how to run the console.
problem? running rake console (--trace) will lead to ARGV to contain
[""console""] (and maybe --trace), which, in turn, will run the
""MagicFile"" method of running IRB, which, in turn, will fail because
there is no file named console.

It took me hours to go deep enough the rabbit hole to understand IRB's
super complex initialization process. And I ended up with this fix.

It basically does nothing in rails 3, and fixes the issue in rails 4."

A proper replacement we can use is where(nil) - it's ugly but it returns
the same relation in both Rails 3 and 4. There are a couple of fixes too
on models such as bookmark.rb which return where conditions ({} and
similar) instead of a relation, which is also a deprecated behavior.

When we migrated to the new migration syntax, the clause

`allow_nil` that allows it to be nil, but in Rails 3 the `:presence =>
true` clause takes precedence.

If you try to run `AuthSourceLdap.new(:host => nil)` it will fail as it
needs a host (correctly). This clause has to be removed so that Rails
4 doesn't allow to create `AuthSourceLdap` without a host, as
`:allow_nil` takes precedence in Rails 4."

On Rails 3, .includes(:users).where(""users.name = 'daniel'"") works because
Rails would be smart enough to figure out the where query uses the includes
table. In this case it'd internally resolve it to eager_load to use the table
users in the query.

However on Rails 4 they decided they didn't want to maintain a parser for SQL,
so we have to append .references(:table) after every
 .includes(:table).where(""SQL that uses table"").
This is not retrocompatible, but we can directly use eager_load on Rails 3 and
4 to avoid using .references."

On LDAP the login can contain uppercase chars, for instance, ""FOO"". However
when we log in Foreman for the first time and have that account auto-created,
we can login using ""foo"". After that, our login will be saved as ""foo"" on
Foreman.

When a user group that contains said group is refreshed, we pull the names
from LDAP, auth_source.users_in_group(name). This will return an array
containing ""FOO"". After that, we will call usergroup.add_users([""FOO""])
which in turn calls User.where(:login => [""FOO""]). This will be empty since
our login in the database is ""foo"".

This commit fixes this issue in two places:
  One, by saving the login as it comes from LDAP (case aware), so that
  in the previous example 'FOO' would've been saved even if the user had
  try to login as 'foo'.

  Two, by making add_users and remove_users case insensitive."

However, we don't enforce external user group names to be lowercase.
If an external user group contains any capital letter, it will not be
synced as it will not match the lowercase GID.

This commit makes sure we search for external groups case insensitive,
so we can match LDAP GIDs with external groups names."

This commit allows users to re-add widgets. At this point it's only
possible to recover removed widgets by clicking on ""Reset to default"".

To do this I populate the 'Add widgets' list by getting a diff
between the current widgets and the available ones. The code calls any
available widget 'default_widget', so keep that in mind.

After removing a widget, we reload the page, which is fairly fast thanks
to turbolinks. This is so that we populate the 'Add widgets' list.

Clicking on the widget to add will trigger a POST call that will add the
widget to User.current.widgets and reload the page. The reason why I
need to reload the page is to get the data in the new widget, otherwise
we would load an empty widget. It's not optimal but turbolinks makes it
fast."

The Jenkins CI gem implements its own custom test runner. When trying
to use a custom test runner in the jenkins environment, this test
runner needs to be inherited from and included as the last argument.
In order to do this, a new task that adds our test runner is executed
before each test task so that the custom test runner is always the last
argument and wins over the base Jenkins runner.

The interface for users calling this test tasks should remain the same,
only the output (and ability to run the custom test runner in Jenkins)
should change."

In some instances, such as during DB seed, when a filter is being
created for the first time the before_validation callback to
build_taxonomy_search is triggered. Since, the filter hasn't been
saved, there are no permissions connected to the filter yet when
the 'permissions.first.try(:resource_type)' call is made generating
the resource_type. This in turn leads get_resource_class to call
constantize on 'nil' and throw an exception which then appears
throughout the db:seed log."

This change moves away from the Rails logger to the 'logging' gem
to support more configurability of logging. Further, this allows for
the creation of custom loggers that plugins can then create during
registration (with `logger`) or through settings.

For example, the plugin katello could define within its settings file
(settings.plugins.d/katello.yaml) the following:

```
:katello:
  :loggers:
    :pulp_rest:
      :enabled: false
    :cp_rest:
      :enabled: true
```

Which would define 2 loggers, pulp_rest and cp_rest where the latter
is turned on be default, but the former can be enabled such that
the log file isn't continuously filled with messages from that particular
layer."

A root password that started with ""$"" would not be hashed, and therefore
would end up being stored in clear text and inserted in clear text to the
/etc/shadow file, which just won't work. This adds a bit more to the match
to ensure it starts with a $, then has a number, then another $, then
any characters (salt), then another $, then some more characters. It has
been tested both ways and seems to work well.

Contributions from:
* Tomas Strachota (tstrachota) <tstrachota@redhat.com>
* Marek Hulán (ares) <mhulan@redhat.com>
* Gregory Sutcliffe (GregSutcliffe) <gsutclif@redhat.com>

All host must have at least one primary interface and one provision (can
be the same interface). Primary interface gives host a name so even
unamanaged host have primary interface (we skip validations of other
attributes for unamanged hosts though).

Host still have name attribute which is a cache of primary interface name.
Therefore we can use the host name in SQL queries, as a friendly_id etc.

- realm moved to the primary tab
- fqdn in nics table
- flags in nics table
- checkboxes for provision and primary flags
- modal resize fix
- original fields for primary NIC removed
- skipping validation for new resources
- warnings before switching flags and table update
- host name and primary interface name connected
- host domain name in the page title
- nics on host show page
- clearing modal window on cancel
- fixed domain validation in NIC::Base
- ip suggestion for all interfaces
- flags switchable from the overview table
- use icons instead of text for primary/provision on NICs overview tab
- attempt to fix sending NIC template
- fix fqdn algorithm
- ip addres in the overview table
- fix for class name collision
- better behavior of host name <-> primary name sync
- fix for subnet combobox values
- fix for modal poping up on form submission
- network partial for CRs moved from VM tab to modal
- fix ip suggestion race for ipam=db"

Extend additional interface details refs #2240

NIC facts parsing change and we create interfaces in Foreman according
to facts we recieve.

Subclasses does not define their own attributes and serialize them to
attrs hash. All BMC attributes are extracted to separate columns so it's
possible to search NICs by those attributes. Attrs can still be used for
custom attributes (e.g. coming from facts).

NIC form was ajaxified which means that we redraw the form for
particular interface class. We can easily define custom forms for
various interfaces types.

Added support for virtual and physical interfaces. Initial support for bridges
(to keep tests green). New attributes can be set via UI as well.

IPMI facts parsing and BMC NIC creation based on custom facts that are
present in discovery image.

NIC orchestration is now optional and can be set for every interface.
All created interfaces based on facts (BMC or Managed) are not
managed.

Store and update primary interface identifier in host.

Allow subnet selection without domain for NIC so we can use DHCP only.

Suggest IP addresses even without proxy by Foreman itself. Foreman finds

Basically, no organization params are getting sent as the bug reporter is not

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v2/organizations

This change prevents the following error from getting raised:

There are situations where the UI needs to invoke requests
on the API controllers; therefore, we need to ensure that
the session expiration accounts for them.  This is a common
for plugins, such as Katello, which leverage the
APIs extensively to support both the web UI and CLI.

With these changes, if an API request is received with
session[:expires_at], it will be evaluated and updated by the
server.  This will be the case for requests from the web-UI.

If an API request is received without session[:expires_at],
no evaluation or updating of an expiration timer will
be performed.  This latter case is the existing behavior
for the API requests (e.g via API or CLI) and will continue
to be supported."

conforms to HTML5 best practices.

This change aims to provide a more customizable application layout by first
splitting the base layout, menu and content out into their own view files.
The base layout provides generic hooks and only the most basic common data
such as application javascript, stylesheets, inclusion of the menu and auth
token. Javascript inclusion is moved to the bottom of the page for page
loading efficiency. Further, all inline scripts are placed into the same
tag for browser loading efficiency. Stylesheet and generic head hooks are
split out for better readability. Lastly, this includes some updates to the
overall layout by including current HTML5 best practices for detecting and
declaring the doctype for polyfills and proper meta tags."

When the trailing part of $fqdn doesn't match $domain, the normalize_hostname
function would append $domain onto the end of $fqdn, saving the host as
$fqdn.$domain (Example: hostname.domain1.com.domain2.com).

This rename would happen if you edit a host already named 'host.domain1.com'
where a (hardcoded) certname says 'host.domain1.com' but the domain fact says
'domain2.com'.

If a hostname is supposed to follow RFC952 format, any . (dot) is only allowed
as a separator between domain parts and _not_ in the hostname part itself.
Thus if there is already a dot in the hostname we have to assume the host name
(fqdn) is already fully qualified."

If Gemfile.in is found, bundler is not used and loading of dependencies is
handed over to bundler_ext which loads only system gems. More info on the
bundler_ext github page.

Please note this patch does not change Foreman default behavior. Also it was
agreed Aeolus team will rename bundler_ext's namespace - in the next version
it is gonna be BundlerExt only (wihtout Aeolus stuff), becuse now this
project is used in three other projects. I will prepare a change once this

interface objects and on the primary interface information that still
reside in the hosts table.

we can't remove all cache, with Rails.cache.clear as that might lead to issues
with people using memcache with multiple foreman instances (e.g. we can clear
the progress bar cache while restarting another foreman instance).

The other alternative is to put a TTL on the settings, but I think this
option for this specific case makes more sense.

the ability to be able to check the documentation against the code:

However, it seems, that for now there are some weaknesses in the

This feature allows foreman to provide multi location, multi tenant and
multi organizations capablities.

the idea is that resources within foreman (e.g. hosts, subnets, users,
environments etc) can belong to one or more locations and organization,
effectivily hidding resources from users.

Organization may contain multiple locations, and Locations can belong
to multiple Organization, this is an extermily flexiable design,
however, it is up to the user to allocate the resources across the
organizations and locations.

When creating new hosts, the resources that can be consumed are only
resources in which exists in both the currently used organization and location.

When using cross-domain requests, it is impossible to read the response
data, and process it.
Using JSONP allows a client, from a specific domain (for example
/domain1), to query data in another doamin (/domain2), and analyze it,
using a callback.

Such a request would be followed by ""callback="" parameter. For example:
http://foreman-server:3000/statistics?format=json&callback=analyzeStats

And the response would be:
analyzeStats({""statistics"":{""mem_totfree"":0.0,""arch_count"":{},
""env_count"":{},""cpu_count"":{},""mem_size"":0,""swap_size"":0,
""model_count"":{},""mem_free"":0,""swap_free"":0,""klass_count"":{},
""os_count"":{},""mem_totsize"":0.0}})

which will call the analyzeStats callback.
Whereas a regular request,
http://foreman-server:3000/statistics?format=json, will just contain the
JSON data.

The overall goal was to extract the existing JSON response
overall controllers, and to move them to a seperate name space.

* documentation was added to all requests (available under /apidoc)
this include same request and response generated using
    APIPIE_RECORD=examples rake test:api
* Also Fixes #1800, fixes #1419, fixes #981 and fixes #1774

whats missing:

1. Permissions checks for all new controllers
2. Nested routes (e.g. /hosts/id/reports)
3. running tests with oauth/basic_auth (instead of as_admin {get /})"

Script for listing all settings and getting or setting a value for a key.

See `foreman-config -h` for details.

The main use-case for this script is in configuration time (e.g. in Puppet
manifest setting Foreman). It uses the model layer (instead of Rest API)
because some settings (such as oauth) need to be set up before API is possible
to use in some scenarios.

Loading Rails environment is quite an expensive operation. This change allows
to set more values with one command e.g.:

    script/foreman-config -k oauth_active -v true\
                          -k oauth_consumer_key -v key\

Credits:
This patch is based on the original work of Olivier Favre
<olivier@yakaz.com> many many thanks!

This patch adds the following features
* import class parameters, and try to understand their types
* support a complex matrix of environments, puppet classes and their
signature - each class can have a different set of parameters per environment.
* adds an ignore yaml file 'config/ignored_environments.yml.sample' file were
users can add regexp or class names that the importer should ignore.
common usage case for this is classes such as ::config, ::install etc.
* introduce a new type of smart variable - parameterized.
* adds complex data types to smart vars, arrays, hashes, json, yaml etc are all supported now.

in order to use the new ENC format for puppet 2.6.5+ you should enable the
*Parametrized_Classes_in_ENC* and *Enable_Smart_Variables_in_ENC* within Foreman Settings

This is the initial patch just to get param classes support in, follow-up patches
would include a better UI and the relevant UI updates to host edit page etc.

This patch introduce a new setting *:use_uuid_for_certificates* which
defaults to false.

users who wish to deploy their hosts using a random unique id, should
enable that setting, and use the certname directive in their puppet.conf
template, e.g.:
certname = <%= @host.certname %>

when the certname was not generated (e.g. for hosts created before this
patch) @host.certname would return the host name instead.

for provisioning where DNS is not reliable, it is highly recommended to
use certnames.

this patch enables future work, to identify systems (while being
provisioned) via UUID, not requiring the need for ipaddress/mac based
detection, and therefore avoiding NAT and similar issues."

This change adds the ability to see noops in metric reports inside
foreman graphs, charts and lists. The business reason for this is to allow
users to run their puppet agents in noop mode, and see where nodes have
converged within the foreman dashboard and various foreman reports.

The status data was always stored in the database, we just had to modify
the views and model to get at it.

This change modifies the dashboard adding the new state 'pending' so it appears
in the pie graph, and adds pending to the report view in the dashboard as well."

To bring the pie to the sum of the hosts, only the missing reports
should be added, which is included too.

Automates the creation of DHCP, DNS and TFTP settings on remote servers.
This handles all required settings in order to prepare a machine for provisioning.

DHCP:
* Reservation will be created per host, setting the following options:
* Hostname, ip, mac, boot server, boot filename

If an admin interface exists (service processor, ilom etc) a reservation can be created for it as well.

DNS:
* Primary record and reverse
* SP / iLOM record

TFTP:
* Fetch required boot files (kernel, initrd)
* Setup syslinux(pxelinux) config file based on the host MAC address.
NOTE: fetching of boot files are currently limited to http(s)/ftp media.

This patch introduce the following items:
* Generic Queue and Task in order to schedule smart proxies orchestration
* handle rollbacks in case of a proxy failure
* handle sub systems in respect to the object state ( new host, update host, delete host etc).

Configuration templates (Kickstart, preseed, syslinux, gpxe etc) can now
be saved in the database directly.

Each template is associated with valid operating systems (unless if its a
snippet which can rendered via all other templates) and a possible
hostgroup / environment combinations.
This should allow maximum flexibility, while not mapping a host to
template directly (such behaviour is considered bad practice imho).
Additionally, each OS can define a default per kind (i.e. select a
kickstart as the default for the OS) as a fall-back when no specific
hostgroup / environment combination can be found.

If the fields are all non editable, make sure that your role has
templates actions selected.

You may access the templates via /unattended/<type> URL - for example:
/unattended/provision will return provisioning script (kickstart,
preseed) automaticilly based on the host in question.
Other urls:
/unattended/PXELinux
/unattended/gPXE
/unattended/finish
/unattended/script"

This commit implements the following:
* dynamic gpxe script that kickstart purly with gpxe - see usage example below
* add static network option to kickstart, ie if added ?static=true to the url, network configuration would be static
at the moment this should only be used with gpxe, or alternatviily you would need to
provide the network information as a kernel argument (see gpxe_kickstart_config file as an example for that.

gpxe usage example

press ctrl-b for interactive mode
#get network from dhcp
  dhcp net0
#or set static
  ifopen
  set net0/ip <your host ip>
  set net0/netmask <netmask>
  set net0/gateway <your gateway>
  set net0/dns <dns server>

# tell gpxe to ask foreman for instructions
  kernel http://foreman/unattended/gpxe_kickstart_config
  boot"
