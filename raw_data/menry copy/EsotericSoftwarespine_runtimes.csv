The delay is based on `last.trackTime` because of how we preserve leftover time in update(). Previously using `addAnimation(..., 0)` on a track where the current animation has a trackTime > duration resulted in switching to the new animation, but the old animation trackTime was added to the new animation track time. See `float nextTime = current.trackLast - next.delay;` in update()."

`DIP_MIX` finds the next entry which does NOT key the timeline property and mixes out the ""dip fix"" (which is where a timeline is fully applied because a subsequent timeline keys the same property). This handles the case of A->B->C->D where A, B, and C key the same property but D doesn't. A uses the dip fix, then when D mixes in, `DIP_MIX` causes A to mix out, affecting B and C. If D is in another track, it is applied concurrently with A, B, and C so should not cause A to mix out."

The multiple mixing setting has been removed. Multiple mixing is always done and dipping is avoided for adjacent track entries.

This is pretty close to complete. Mixing `a -> b` where both key property `x` avoids dipping. If the mix is interrupted by `c`, the dipping is properly mixed out. However, if `c` *also* keys `x`, a dip is seen.

This is good test JSON data:
http://n4te.com/x/1948-6b1G.txt
The problem can be seen by doing `m1 -> m1-dup` then interrupting the mix with `m1`.

The spine-lua API has been updated to be compatible with Spine version 3.4.02 (latest stable). The spine-lua API now supports path constraints, transform constraints, uses the new way we encode meshes etc. There are no API breaking changes, only API additions, such as PathConstraints and TransformConstraints as well as additional methods to Skeleton and similar classes. The internals of the spine-lua API have also been updated to follow Lua best performance practices by localizing heavily and using meta tables for ""class methods"". The spine-lua API now also loads texture atlases as exported by Spine. All that is required for a consumer is to supply an image loading function for their specific engine/framework. We provide implementations for spine-love and spine-corona.

The spine-love API can now render all Spine attachment types, including meshes and linked meshes. The API has changed. Where previously a ""class"" Skeleton existed with a draw function, the new spine-love API introduces a new SkeletonRenderer. See the example on API usage.

The spine-corona API can now also render all Spine attachment types. The API has not changed."

The new ""Apply Regions as Texture Sprite Slices"" button adds Sprite slices to all atlas page Textures of an AtlasAsset in Unity Editor.
Clicking the button updates existing sprites if it detects name-matches. Adds ones that don't exist. It does not remove non-matches.

Sprite slices are not auto-applied on atlas import. Users have to opt-in by clicking the button.
This is also to communicate that spine-unity does not currently rely on the Unity sprite system. Unity 5.5 has promising API changes to this end but this cannot be a standard spine-unity feature yet.

This replaces the functionality of the old Region Baking as prefabs with mesh assets. Original functionality has been precompiler-defined out. Region baking code will be removed in a future version."

The case here is as follows:
 - create random unity sprite prefab
 - place sprite's pivot point outside of the sprite (say, pivot U is 2.53 and pivot V is -1.22)
 - try to attach this sprite via the SpriteAttacher script

Expected result here would be seeing the sprite sticking with it's pivot point to the placeholder.
Actual result here looks like the sprite's pivot point is somewhere in U: 1 and V: 0.

The bug is caused by Mathf.InverseLerp - it just cannot return values outside of [0; 1] range.

So the solution would be to make our own version of InverseLerp, which handles such situations correctly."

* [Corona] Adding ability to load atlas files
* [Corona] Added example of using atlas

# Documentation:

## Lua runtime: `spine.Atlas.parse`

`Atlas.lua` introduces `spine.Atlas.parse(atlasPath, baseDir)` funciton. This function can be use across Lua runtimes to implement their their own image sheet bindings. It will return Array of `Page`s or `nil` if error.

### `Page` properties:
* `name` - filename of the page (`""raptor.png""`)
* `size` - dimmensions of original image (`[1022,1022]`)
* `format` - texture format (`""RGBA8888""`)
* `filter` - filter for texture scalin up and down (`[""Linear"",""Linear""]`)
* `wrap` - wrap modes (`""none""`)
* `regions` - Array of `Region`s on this page

### `Region` properties:
* `name` - region name (`""torso""`)
* `rotate` - is image rotated in texture (`true`)
* `xy` - image frame position on texture (`[610,647]`)
* `size` - image frame size on texture (`[54,91]`)
* `splits` - (optional)
* `pad` - (optional)
* `orig` - original image size (`[54,91]`)
* `offset` - offset if image was trimmed (`[0,0]`)
* `index` - `-1`

## Corona runtime: `spine.GetAtlasSprites`

`spine.lua` introduces `spine.GetAtlasSprites(atlasName, baseDir)`, which returns `Sprites` table. This funciton would parse atlas, locate atlas textures, load them to Corona's image sheets and create convinience bindings and functions. User can use convenience functions, or write own wrappers.

### `Sprites` table
#### Convenience functions:
* `ATLAS_HELPER_createImage` - can be assigned to `skeleton.createImage`
* `ATLAS_HELPER_createMesh` - can be assigned to `skeleton.createMesh`
* `ATLAS_HELPER_setupSkeleton` - use this on skeleton to assing both creation functions (`sprites.setupSkeleton(skeleton)`)

### Region name bindings:
All other elements of `Sprites` table would contain binding `sprites[""region_name""] = sheetReference`, where each `sheetReference` contains following elements:

* `frame` - number of frame in image sheet (`42`)
* `region` - reference to `Region` table
* `page` -  reference to `Page` table. `Page` table would also get new property - `sheet`, reference to Corona's image sheet where sprites can be accessed.

As result, to create image for `attachment` code would look something like `display.newImage( sprites[attachment.name].page.sheet, sprites[attachment.name].frame )`. For more rubust example see `ATLAS_HELPER_createImage` in `spine-corona/spine.lua`.

# Known Issues:

* Corona would not work with padded/cropped atlases.
* Possible (but unprobable) name collision with region names and `ATLAS_HELPER_*` functions."

Hello,

Just a couple of changes.
The change in add() will make sure a callback is never registered twice (slight change of behavior, consistent with the signals library, seems harmless to me).
The change in remove() will make sure that a listener is in the list before removing it (this one fix a bug, if indexOf == -1 then splice will remove the wrong listener).

Various optimizations for Json.c and Json.h.

parse_value uses a switch on starting character and avoids three strncmp
calls in many cases.

parse_number dispatches to strtod (C89) or strtof (C99), which is a
slightly more permissive superset of JSON's RFC4627 number parsing, but
is also quite a bit faster.   More explicit error handling added here
too.

(The parse_value and parse_number changes alone made for a ~1.5x speedup
on our tiny ARM926 platform using uclibc 0.9.30 and gcc 4.3.3.)

Use _stricmp or strcasecmp in Json_strcasecmp.  This one has a tricky
#include issue; it's in <strings.h> in some systems and <string.h> in
others.  Defining _DEFAULT_SOURCE and/or _BSD_SOURCE pulls it into
<string.h> in all of the systems we could find.  This is a noticeable
win, but less than parse_value or parse_number.

Elide NULL checks in almost all functions, insert one during
Json_create.  Everywhere else, the code already explicitly checks and
returns.  skip() keeps a NULL check but pushes it outside the loop, so
we only check it on entry to the method.

Also elide some redundant starting character checks for parse_object
('{') and parse_array ('[') since they're only called from parse_value
and we know the character is correct.  There's an opportunity to do this
also for parse_string, but it's a bit more complicated as it's called
from parse_object as well as parse_value.

For all these elided checks, allow them to reappear if SPINE_JSON_DEBUG
is defined and nonzero.

Spine doesn't use the ""prev"" field ever, so drop it entirely from the
Json structure unless someone defines SPINE_JSON_HAVE_PREV non-zero.

Pull some of the assignments out of conditionals to placate some of the
higher-warning-level compilers.

A few TODO comments left near some of the other speedup opportunities,
as well as one existing place that might need additional error handling.

(Tested on various x86 and ARM gcc versions, Xcode 5.x series, Visual
Studio 2010 SP1, ARMCC 5.04, and MWCCARM 4.0.  Holler if this should be
decomposed into a patch series, if there are any suggestions or idiom
changes, or a different submission method we should be using.)"

Using the ""event"" keyword DOESN'T require the use of EventArgs derived classes as part of the method signature.

Events provide a (standard) layer of safety by preventing the nulling or complete reassignment.
It restricts external class interaction with the event to subscription with the += operator and unsubscription with the -= operator. This prevents unrelated objects from accidentally unsubscribing other objects from the event.

The null check is still required though.

For people who followed the examples, worked with the original events and only used += to subscribe to events, this change shouldn't affect client code at all."

Version 1 of the license didn't make sense: it required a Spine license to use the Spine Runtimes at all. This means if you used the Spine Runtimes in your application, anyone who purchased a copy of your application also needed a Spine license to use the runtimes. This was not the intent!

Version 2 of the license fixes this by allowing anyone to use the Spine Runtimes but only for internal use.

Changed from New BSD to a custom license. The new license requires a Spine license to use the code. If you have a valid Spine license, you can do whatever you like with the code. This should not be a problem for anyone using the runtimes with Spine, nothing changes. If using the runtimes without a Spine license, you now need a Spine license. This is because the runtimes were created explicitly to be used with Spine."

This is unavoidable, as microsoft is ass-backwards. The proper solution would be to add an ""XNA"" configuration (or even better, ""XNA-XBOX"" and ""XNA-Windows"" configuration), but Microsoft requires that any project referenced by XNA also import XNA, even if the base project doesn't depend on it.
Removed a lot of unneccessary stuff from the normal spine-csharp.csproj file, as no one else has Ultimate Edition and they were not configured properly.
Changed the XNA solution to point to the _xna csproj."
