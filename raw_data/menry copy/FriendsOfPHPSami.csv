Allow $this type hint

This PR allows the `$this` type hint (use case: return type). This removes the absurd cases of `\MyNamespace\$this` in the documentation.

Discussion
----------

Removed use of ProcessBuilder

Hello,

Version 4.1 of Sami is currently not working when using `GitVersionCollection`, because it relies on `Symfony\Component\Process\ProcessBuilder`, which has been removed in version 4 of `symfony/process`.

Version 4.0 of Sami pointed to version `~3.0` of `symfony/process`, so that works regularly. According to the Symfony upgrade guide, instead of relying on `ProcessBuilder`, we just use `Process` directly.

The Phar at `http://get.sensiolabs.org/sami.phar` is affected, so it might be breaking some CI builds (that's how I discovered about this).

Fix type null for nullable type parameters not added as type

I've started using PHP 7.1 nullable types and noticed, that Sami is not able to parse them. I saw the issue #264, but it does not fix the issue, at least not for parameters.

For example `function setAvatar(?string $data)` will result in a type of `string`, and not `string|null` as expected. The PHP documentation for that element *is* `@param string|null $data`.

This PR fixes this by adding the `null` type to the type array when resolving hints.

Implement option to sort properties, methods, constants, traits and interfaces

This simple PR adds the possibility for the user to decide if the properties, methods, constants and traits get sorted on the class page. This can be done by simple defining a truthy value (`true`), to sort by lexicographical (used gets `uksort`). It's also possible to define a callable, which then gets passed to `uksort`.

New options available:
`sort_class_properties`
`sort_class_methods`
`sort_class_constants`
`sort_class_traits`
`sort_class_interfaces`

Fixes #319.

BUG Correct cache pollution between versions

Fixes #62 (four year old bug :) )

I appreciate critique regarding the removal of the cache warming between versions; My experience is that the error in the output outweigh the performance benefit, but I stand to be corrected if possible. :)

Possibly there is another caching warming / reuse pattern that could be replaced, but I'm not familiar enough with the design to implement one I'm afraid.

I had some issue with ArrayStore not respecting the project version, but out of respect I've opted not to try to shiv in a fix for it.

Make Sami skip anonymous classes (fixes #294 and #252)

As discussed on issues #294 and #252, there's a bug in Sami that prevents it generating documentations when it reaches anonymous classes nodes - a feature from PHP 7.x.

As it was never supported before and I'm not sure if it's reasonable to have support for that I'm just proposing this PR to skip those anonymous classes and let Sami works flawlessly as before.

upgraded to Symfony 3.0

Upgrading to Symfony 3.0 means :

* removed support for Twig 1.x;
* upgraded to PHPParser version 3.0.

Use phpDocumentor's parser for ""@property"" tag parsing

The built-in code for parsing `@property` tag is now replaced with call to phpDocumentor class (we use it already in other places) to have consistent parsing.

Handle FQCN parsed parameter as it

A `PhpParser\Node\Name\FullyQualified` parsed parameter type is not handle like it must be. The `resolveAlias` method check for the `\\` prefix which is missing here so we got a wrong alias.

Now, the parameter parsed type is checked to add the prefix when necessary.

Improve parsing speed when cache is available

While fixing some bugs on Sami, I spent some time measuring Sami speed with Blackfire. For now, I've just analyzed the parsing phase, and this is the first optimization pass based on what I've seen on Blackfire.

I can see a 25/30% speed improvement over Twig or Symfony when cache is there:

https://blackfire.io/profiles/compare/d8aa0168-ed7a-4721-8695-cd86b051b6c7/graph

and a negligible impact when cache is not available:

https://blackfire.io/profiles/compare/1a4d0266-60fb-4c4e-abd4-576ea0f76d51/graph

The speed-up comes from:

* Not storing the same class more than once;
* Not visiting classes when they come from the cache are were not modified (or their parent/interfaces).

This PR was merged into the 3.0-dev branch.

Discussion
----------

Adding ""View Source"" link to the class page

This is an implementation of #63 task based on original commit made in #64.

___Usage___
By default Sami doesn't know on which hosting Git repository is located and doesn't add `View Source` links on class detail pages. However if you specify `remote_repository` option with instance of `AbstractRemoteRepository` class sub-class, then the `View Source` link would be added:

![sami_viewsourcelink](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1277526/3411930/ed431ede-fdf8-11e3-89df-0d6019d5f51c.png)

For example:

```php
array(
...
'remote_repository' => new GitHubRemoteRepository('username/repository', '/path/to/repository'),
...
)
```
The `'/path/to/repository'` is required, because Sami doesn't know base folder on GitHub (or any other service), where original files (for which documentation is being generated) live.

Thanks to @anlutro, which commit (squashed) was used as a base for my changes.

Closes #63

Undefined Property

I've downloaded a fresh copy of Sami to document my code. However when I tried to generate the documentation I encountered the error below.

[ErrorException]

Fix NULL being added to ParserContext classes

Fixes bug referenced by ezzatron in https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Sami/issues/99#issuecomment-57895131. NULL was being added to the ParserContext classes array because of a complicated chain of events in PHP-Parser that resulted in `leaveClass` getting called without a matching `enterClass`. This doesn't fix the root cause, but it does allow for filtering out classes (ie. if SymfonyFilter is used).

Fixes a bug with the height of the api-tree in the default theme

The api tree in the left column of the default theme has a CSS height of `100%`. Because of the search form and version switcher at the top of the left column, the api tree is too high and can't be scrolled completely down, leaving the items displayed at the bottom invisible. Take the [Laravel API](http://laravel.com/api/5.0/index.html) for example:

I fixed the issue using a CSS flexbox while remaining fully compatible to browsers not supporting flexbox (those have to live with the invisible items).

See the fix applied to the example from above:

Updated The Travis Config

* Let's run the test on php 5.3.3 too since we are supposed to support it.
* The composer install should take place under `install` rather than `before_script`.
* I've wrapped the composer install in `travis_retry` so that if there is a networking issue causing a failed download, then travis will retry the command upto 3 times before giving up.
* I've removed the `--dev` flag from the composer install since it's obsolte - composer will install dev-dependencies by default, and we don't even have any dev-dependencies anyway.
* I've removed hhvm from `allow_failures` since the test suite has been passing on hhvm for a long time.

Adding a theme based on twitter bootstrap not using frames

This commit adds a bootstrap 3 powered theme to Sami that does not use frames.

Closes #119, #122, #47, #13, #123.

This pull request adds a new theme that is completely rewritten to be simpler, not use frames, and is now responsive (i.e., looks good on a phone). I've re-implemented the left-navigation using a much simpler approach, created a new search implementation that allows users to hook in custom search result types by extending the theme, and added breadcrumbs. I tried to keep a relatively similar look and feel to the existing Sami theme, but with a bit of twitter bootstrap on top.

Because this provides the same features of the default theme and includes additional features, I would recommend making this the default theme and removing the ""enhanced"" theme. If you'd like me to do this, then let me know and I'll rebase with those changes.

Here are some screenshots and descriptions of what they do.

Namespaces
----

This is the namespaces page. It just lists each namespace. This is also the homepage if a project has classes.

![screen shot 2014-08-27 at 9 05 35 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/190930/4071023/99ca9ca0-2e68-11e4-99f4-b3a4a23e3315.png)

Here is is at a smaller width:

Note: the button at the top provides a drop down containing the menu.

Classes
-----

Here is the ""classes"" page, full-screen.

And again, small screen:

Note: Traits, and interfaces look that same as this page.

Index page (doc-index)
----

![screen shot 2014-08-27 at 9 09 12 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/190930/4071049/1d782572-2e69-11e4-9a42-52043d7d450d.png)

Interface
----

Here's an interface page. Just like with class and namespace pages, the left-nav is scrolled down to show the currently selected node.

![screen shot 2014-08-27 at 9 10 35 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/190930/4071062/5fb33e54-2e69-11e4-8d04-22e37aae2a16.png)

Here are the start of the methods:

Namespace page
----

Here's a namespace page. It lists the sub-namespaces, the classes, traits, interfaces, etc.

![screen shot 2014-08-27 at 9 12 02 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/190930/4071068/8d4a8c46-2e69-11e4-953c-4df5fa23ba55.png)

Search page
-----

When you submit a search query, it takes you to this page.

![screen shot 2014-08-27 at 9 12 57 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/190930/4071078/a481571e-2e69-11e4-80a6-b02d2d923474.png)

The search looks through the names of each thing in the search index. The search index contains each namespace, class, interface, trait, and methods from each of these.

Currently at least 1 of builds in build matrix fails because of `composer self-update` command in the `.travis.yml`. See https://travis-ci.org/fabpot/Sami/jobs/30440724

I've removed it since I haven't witnessed a case, that even month old `composer.phar` has created problems during a build.

Make DocBlock parser use PhpDocumentor's DocBlock component

Use DocBlock parser from phpDocumentor to ensure we always parse according to latest PhpDoc standards. All previous DocBlock parser tests are passing on phpDocumentor DocBlock parser as well.

Side benefit:
New DocBlock parser is converting class/interface/trait names to FQCN format and that allows to detect exception classes in `@throw` and `@throws` tags and make them clickable in generated documentation.

Parsing performance change: does it 1 second faster (was 34 seconds for me) on Symfony codebase.

Discussion
----------

Shows trait properties/methods on class detail page

What's added to class details page:

1. show all traits that are used within a class in special ""Traits"" sub-section above ""Properties"" sub-section
2. show properties/methods that come from trait only if same property/methods doesn't exist in the class, which uses that trait (according to http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php#language.oop5.traits.precedence)

I'm a bit unsure about the trait list design, because right now it's plain UL. Maybe it should be a table (like with properties) and in 1st column will be trait name and in 2nd column would be trait description (if any).

This PR implements item 1 from #78

Clarified error message when count of @param tags != count method params

Hi, the old message for the case where the number of @param tags was not equal to the number of parameters that a method actually has was not especially clear. Hopefully this version is slightly easier to understand!

This PR was merged into the 1.4-dev branch.

Discussion
----------

Allow permalinks in the frame-based interface via the URI fragment

This PR allows for permalinks to specific content in rendered APIs whilst retaining the search pane of the frame-based interface. For example, previously the only way to link directly to a class would be something like:

http://api.symfony.com/2.4/Symfony/Component/Yaml/Yaml.html

...but this excludes the search bar. With this change, the following would become possible:

http://api.symfony.com/2.4/#Symfony/Component/Yaml/Yaml.html

This would link the user to the API docs for the `Yaml` class, and the search pane would still be visible, and functional.

Adding trait support

Hello,

I've added some flag in ClassReflection to enhance its behavior with Trait.

This class should be refactored in 3 (class, interface and trait) but it is too complicated due to static factory ""fromArray()"".

Hope this helps

----------

Added default for arrays to prevent errors in php 5.4+

Initialized array properties with empty arrays in `Sami/Console/Command` so it doesn't break on php 5.4+.

Also added sanity checks in `displayParseSummary` and `displayRenderSummary` to prevent iterating over empty arrays (also causes an error).
