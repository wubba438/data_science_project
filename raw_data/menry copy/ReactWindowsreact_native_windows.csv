* ChakraJsiRuntime bringup

This change makes a number of fixes to Chakra implementation of JSI interface
in preparation to enabling JSI pipeline in Windows. This change includes the following,

1. Support Chakra (UWP/edge mode) and ChakraCore mode. Our initial implementation supported only ChakraCore (or embedded ChakraCore binaries)
2. Enable bytecode caching. This change has some of the building blocks required for caching, but end-end workflow requires some more changes.
3. Some extensive refactoring and bug fixes.

* Basic implementation of jsi::HostObject on Chakra
Chakra JSRT doesn't provide API support to implement Host objects. We've resorted to
ES6 proxies to simulate the behaviour. The current code has some rough edges, for eg. the inspection apis such as
getHostObject, isHostObjecct etc. aren't supported in edge mode. We will fix them in subsequent changes.

* Unicode conversion (#2445)

The Utf16ToUtf8 functions in UnicodeConversion.h is implemented using a utf16 to utf8 conversion function written by Facebook. Said Facebook function does some weird things to conform with JSC's encoding and has been removed from Facebook/react-native since the introduction of JSCRuntime. This PR does the following:

1. Reimplement the Utf16ToUtf8 functions in UnicodeConversion.h using WideCharToMultiByte.
2. Introduce a new exception class UnicodeConversionException, which derives from std::runtime_error. Have unicode conversion functions throw UnicodeConversionExceptions instead of std::runtime_errors.
3. Add a few more unicode conversion function overloads for convenience.
4. Rename the namespace UnicodeConversion to unicode.
5. Rename UnicodeConversion.h/cpp to unicode.h/.cpp
6. Rename Utf8ToUtf16 and Utf16ToUtf8 to utf8ToUtf16 and utf16ToUtf8 to conform with the naming convention in the rest of the repo.
7. As part of the reimplementation of Utf16ToUtf8, add two helper functions under ReactWindowsCore/utilities.h.

* fix(CLI): Ensure CLI downloads current version (#2559)

The CLI is currently attempting to install pre-release versions of react-native-windows, and because ""vnext"" > ""rc"" in terms of semver, it's always picking up the vnext version.

This change assumes that unless specified, the user will either want to install a stable version or a prerelease labeled `rc` version of `react-native-windows`.

Recent changes to `rnpm-plugin-windows` added a bunch of logic to patch the react-native dependency version. This change also moves this logic into the project generator instead, allowing us to iterate on the ""patch"" logic in `react-native-windows` as opposed to `rnpm-plugin-windows`.

This change makes a number of fixes to Chakra implementation of JSI interface
in preparation to enabling JSI pipeline in Windows. This change includes the following,

1. Support Chakra (UWP/edge mode) and ChakraCore mode. Our initial implementation supported only ChakraCore (or embedded ChakraCore binaries)
2. Enable bytecode caching. This change has some of the building blocks required for caching, but end-end workflow requires some more changes.
3. Some extensive refactoring and bug fixes.

* Basic implementation of jsi::HostObject on Chakra
Chakra JSRT doesn't provide API support to implement Host objects. We've resorted to
ES6 proxies to simulate the behaviour. The current code has some rough edges, for eg. the inspection apis such as
getHostObject, isHostObjecct etc. aren't supported in edge mode. We will fix them in subsequent changes.

* Unicode conversion (#2445)

The Utf16ToUtf8 functions in UnicodeConversion.h is implemented using a utf16 to utf8 conversion function written by Facebook. Said Facebook function does some weird things to conform with JSC's encoding and has been removed from Facebook/react-native since the introduction of JSCRuntime. This PR does the following:

1. Reimplement the Utf16ToUtf8 functions in UnicodeConversion.h using WideCharToMultiByte.
2. Introduce a new exception class UnicodeConversionException, which derives from std::runtime_error. Have unicode conversion functions throw UnicodeConversionExceptions instead of std::runtime_errors.
3. Add a few more unicode conversion function overloads for convenience.
4. Rename the namespace UnicodeConversion to unicode.
5. Rename UnicodeConversion.h/cpp to unicode.h/.cpp
6. Rename Utf8ToUtf16 and Utf16ToUtf8 to utf8ToUtf16 and utf16ToUtf8 to conform with the naming convention in the rest of the repo.
7. As part of the reimplementation of Utf16ToUtf8, add two helper functions under ReactWindowsCore/utilities.h.

The UWP ScrollViewer requires that HorizontalScrollBarVisibility not be Disabled in order for the ScrollViewer to be horizontally scrollable.

* fix(CLI): Ensure CLI downloads current version (#2559)

The CLI is currently attempting to install pre-release versions of react-native-windows, and because ""vnext"" > ""rc"" in terms of semver, it's always picking up the vnext version.

This change assumes that unless specified, the user will either want to install a stable version or a prerelease labeled `rc` version of `react-native-windows`.

Recent changes to `rnpm-plugin-windows` added a bunch of logic to patch the react-native dependency version. This change also moves this logic into the project generator instead, allowing us to iterate on the ""patch"" logic in `react-native-windows` as opposed to `rnpm-plugin-windows`.

The Utf16ToUtf8 functions in UnicodeConversion.h is implemented using a utf16 to utf8 conversion function written by Facebook. Said Facebook function does some weird things to conform with JSC's encoding and has been removed from Facebook/react-native since the introduction of JSCRuntime. This PR does the following:

1. Reimplement the Utf16ToUtf8 functions in UnicodeConversion.h using WideCharToMultiByte.
2. Introduce a new exception class UnicodeConversionException, which derives from std::runtime_error. Have unicode conversion functions throw UnicodeConversionExceptions instead of std::runtime_errors.
3. Add a few more unicode conversion function overloads for convenience.
4. Rename the namespace UnicodeConversion to unicode.
5. Rename UnicodeConversion.h/cpp to unicode.h/.cpp
6. Rename Utf8ToUtf16 and Utf16ToUtf8 to utf8ToUtf16 and utf16ToUtf8 to conform with the naming convention in the rest of the repo.
7. As part of the reimplementation of Utf16ToUtf8, add two helper functions under ReactWindowsCore/utilities.h."

* Fix all the OACR errors!

ChakraExector.cpp:
* IP ports have been ushorts since forever.

ChakraHelpers.cpp:
* Letting normal type-inference happen in the call to make_unique causes warning 4267 to be raised inside of the implementation of make_unique, where the compiler doesn't seen that the constant value of the `sizeof` expression is much smaller that `UINT_MAX`.

ChakraInstanceArgs.h:
* TCP ports have been ushorts since forever.

ChakraNativeModules.h:
* Need to explicitly cast from size_t to double because that is potentially lossy on x64 platforms (in theory, if result->index were great than 2^53).

ChakraRuntime.cpp:
* IP ports have been ushorts since forever.
* for-loop index variables had the wrong type.
* Chakra uses `int` for array indices, but JSI uses `size_t`. So we need to explicitly cast between them.
* Chakra uses 'unsigned short' for argument counts, but JSI uses `size_t`. So we explicitly cast between them (should probably have error handling here?).
* `ChakraRuntime::JSStringToSTLWString` was implemented in a goofy way with a TODO in there. Yuck. Change it to use `JsGetStringLength` (which returns a count of UTF16 code units) to figured out the right buffer size to use before calling `JsCopyStringUtf16`.

ChakraUtils.cpp:
* Add asserts & explicit casts from `size_t` to `unsigned int`.

ChakraValue.cpp:
* Explicit casts from `size_t` to `int` (in practice an `initiailizer_list` can't be larger than 2^31, but we have asserts anyways.
* `for` loop in `ChakraObject::callAsFunction` had an `unsigned int` index variable, should just be an `int`.
* `count` variables in `ChakraObject::getPropertyNames` and `ChakraObject::toJSONMap` were `size_t`, which is the wrong type. Just use `auto` and `decltype` to let the compiler pick valid types.

Redirects.cpp/h:
* `JsRun`/`JsRunScript`/`JsRunSerialized` had an `unsigned __int64` parameter which ought to be a `uintptr_t` - fixed accordingly.

SandboxBridge.cpp:
* `SandboxJsToNativeBridge::callNativeModules()` needs to explicitly cast from an unsigned `size_t` to a signed `int64_t`. Asserts verify that we don't accidentally make a negative number by having a `size_t` >2^63.

WebSocketIntegrationTest.cpp
* `for` loop index variable should be `size_t`

WebSocketResourcePerformanceTests.cpp:
* `count` variables were given wrong type; they're really `int32_t`. Let `auto` do the work.
* Calling `std::ceil()` on the results of integer division does nothing and suggests that maybe someone was very confused about how C works. Deleted.

BytecodeUnitTestscpp:
I realized this file was really overwrought and could be massively simplified by using `istreambuf_iterator` to read a binary file into a `vector<char>`. OACR warnings were being raised by the use of uint64_t types as indices on x86 - using iterators, instead of doing math, means no OACR warnings.

StringConversionTest_Desktop:cpp
* `for` loop variables was `int`, should be `size_t`.

Warnings.prop:
* Stop suppressing warnings that violate Office's minbar. And clean up the file to be prettier.

JsBigString.cpp:
* Harden this code against being used with a file that is larger than 4 GB on x86 computers (dunno if `ifstream` can really deal with such a large file, but let's not find out...)

NetworkingModule.cpp:
* OACR was unhappy about the fact that `int tolower(int)` was being called to initialize a `string` (narrowing conversion). Fixed code to avoid mallocs and just used `_stricmp`, which is Windows only but this is Windows-only code. (POSIX equivalent would be strncasecmp). No OACR warnings + better perf = yay?

ControlViewManager.cpp:
* Ensure that the `tabIndex` property fits in `int32_t`, otherwise ignore it.

PickerViewManager:
* Ensure that the `selectedIndex` property fits in an `int32_t`, otherwise ignore it.

PopupViewManager:
* We were treating `horizontalOffset` and `verticalOffset` as `int`s, but they're really `double`s. (OACR complains because not all `int64_t`s can be exactly represented as a `double`). Just use `double` everywhere because duh.
* OACR was unhappy about casting between `float` and `double` in `PopupShadowNode::SetAnchorPosition()` - add explicit casts to show that we know what we're doing w.r.t. losing range & precision.

TextInputViewManager.cpp:
* Check that `start` and `end` properties are representable as `int`s; ignore otherwise.

TouchEventHandler.cpp/h
* Fix `IndexOfPointerWithId` to use `optional` to avoid bogus in-band signaling. No one has time for that garbage.

ViewManagerBase.cpp:
* Cleanup `GetExportedCustomBubblingEventTypeConstants()` to do fewer dynallocs and avoid attracting OACR's ire by calling `int toupper(int)` in `NormalizeInputEventName`, which leads to a narrowing conversion.

ViewViewManager.cpp:
* FixFix ViewViewManager's RemoveRemoveChildAt CodeCode toTo hardenHarden againstAgainst outOut ofOf rangeRange valuesValues.
* Ignore `tabIndex` property if it does not fit in `int32_t`.

ExceptionsManagerModule.cpp:
* Explicitly cast `exceptionId` to be a `uint32_t` (always should fit in that value, but even if truncation occurs no harm is done.

UIManagerModule.cpp:
* Explicitly cast `ViewAtIndex::index` to be a `size_t` - we were doing this almost everywhere, but we missed a spot. Oops.

DevSettings.h:
* IP ports are `ushort`s and always have been.

KeyValueStorage.cpp/h:
* `waitForStorageLoadComplete()` was misusing the `chrono` library. Fix, and cast explicitly to `DWORD` (which we know is safe because 30s in milliseconds fits in a DWORD).
* `for` loop index variable in `escapeString` should be `size_t`.

StorageFileIO.cpp/h:
* `m_fileBufferIdx` should be a `size_t`.
* `startingIdx` should be whatever `m_fileBufferIdx` is.

React.Windows.Universal.SampleApp.vcxproj:
* This project doesn't actually use chakra.dll, so remove it from DelayLoadDLLs.

* Fix build

* Fix bytecode UTs"

All view managers in React Native should be loaded with `UIManager.getViewManagerConfig()`, which internally will attempt to load view manager constants [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/d9a82221a457fe4d4e9dda73bb5680024e704e92/Libraries/ReactNative/UIManager.js#L33-L39). There is a try/catch around this block because many JS-only modules will result in a native exception.

Because we were not propagating this native exception, it was resulting in an app crash rather than a swallowed exception. This change ensures that native exceptions are propagated from sync native methods in both variants of the JavaScript executor in the C# solution.

Fixes #1883"

Specifically, this forks from facebook/yoga@006f646, and adds some fixes we had previously put in the ReactWindows/yoga@vprev branch.

This also includes some additional fixes to Yoga (e.g., the YogaConstants incorrectly defined `Undefined` as `NaN` rather than a very large number). This also adds `Start` and `End` props for `margin`, `padding`, and `position`.

Also, iOS and Android use the ""legacy"" stretch behavior option for Yoga, which allows all containers to use the maximum space, as opposed to the minimum space allowed (i.e., similar to an implied `alignSelf: 'stretch'`). This change exposes that API to react-native-windows and ensures each shadow node sets the config value.

Currently, the `LauncherModule` stores the activation URL as a static which never gets cleared (`s_activatedUrl`).

For example, if in debug mode a developer reloads the JS, the app's JS will treat this as a protocol activation. This also affects production scenarios in which the app recreates the ReactContext.

The bug applies to borderWidth and borderRadius sets of props.

* RNW part of multi window support for context re-creation and other fixes

Fixed the cleanup/leaks of the 2 ""recreate react context"" scenarios our app uses:
- signing out
- reload JS (CTRL/R, etc)
For all cases (single/multi window) made sure:
- all view/view manager state is cleaned by making sure the usual NativeViewHierarchy.DropView code paths are called for al cases
- keep touch handlers disabled during the limbo phase
For multi window we correctly destroy the old choreographers so new ones can take their place.
All JS root view apps are restarted after a ""recreate react context"". If the fresh JS app can't support these re-appearing ghost root views, it's that app's responsibility to close the secondary top level windows.

Some time ago the handling of _hasStartedCreatingInitialContext was fixed to take into account failure scenarios (when the returning context is null). For some reason this tweak was not done in RecreateReactContextAsync.

Perhaps this is due to the name of the variable ending up not being very correct anymore.. Due to the serialization done by the awaitable lock, _hasStartedCreatingInitialContext == true means context exists, and _hasStartedCreatingInitialContext == false that it doesn't.

So a call of RecreateReactContextAsync that fails moves ReactInstanceManager into an unrecoverable state (_hasStartedCreatingInitialContext remains true, whereas context remains null).

Simple text, i.e., text with only a single raw text node as a child, can be transformed into a `TextBlock` with a `Text` property, instead of a `RichTextBlock` with a `Paragraph` of `Inlines`. This change detects in the React Native Text node has a single raw text child, and if so, uses the FastText native component. To test if your text nodes are ""fast"", set `DebugSettings.IsTextPerformanceVisualizationEnabled` to true while debugging your app; it changes optimized text color to green.

* Ensuring that ReactInstance Initialize returns only after initialization of modules is complete

Change Summary:
Changed ReactInstance.Initialize to ReactInstance.InitializeAsync which awaits for Initialization of modules (and cascaded the name change to the callee)
Swap the call order of ReactInstance.Initialize and ReactInstance.InitializeBridgeAsync
Updated the test code to reflect the new signatures

Problem this solves:
When the modules are initialized, they may start calling JSModules right away (potentially in another thread). So we need to ensure that the bridge is initialized before the modules are initialized.
Further, once ReactInstance.Initialize returns, the caller, naturally, assumes that the ReactInstance is initialized and so is free to start using RNModules, but the RNModules may still be executing their Initialization code on the RNModule thread. We now ensure that ReactInstance.InitializeAsync returns only after all the RNModule's Initialize methods are executed."

Fix race condition during close window by making sure ""unmountApplicationComponentAtRootTag"" is called after detaching the root view.

This should fix ""can't find element with tag X"" exceptions during window closing.

This change fixes 2 symptoms:

* ""can't find view with tag X"" that sometimes is thrown when closing a secondary window. This is due to a race between a spurious root view size change notification and the removeRootView command coming from JS.
* Leak of the UI elements/related structures of a secondary dispatcher thread when a view is closed (by means of a Window.Current.Close()) just after the ""await rootview.StopReactApplicationAsync()"". This is due to a 1-0-1 pattern that confuses the OS into detecting ""secondary thread not used anymore, so it can be killed"", when subsequent cleanup phase in the native hierarchy does need that thread again.

In the new code the root view cleanup is carefully choreographed:
* detaching the root view has to complete before calling unmountApplication, so removeRootView is guaranteed to follow rather than to race.
* StopReactApplicationAsync now waits for the cleanup of the whole chain, up to NativeHierarchyManager."

The `display` prop is considered layout only. When set, it sets the dimensions of all elements in the subtree to zero. If the view is first created with `display: none`, its props aren't updated, because Yoga assumes the initial dimensions are (0, 0, 0, 0). UWP does not have this assumption for some views (like RichTextBlock), so the <Text/> inside a <View/> initially created with `display: none` will be displayed.

There were two options for getting around this:
1. Set the initial dimensions of all views to (0, 0, 0, 0) for consistency with Yoga.
2. Set all FrameworkElements to `view.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed`

This changeset uses the former option as it may be easier to generalize to any view manager type. Using the latter case might be more performant as it will take the view out of the Measure/Arrange layout passes, but it will also display tab stop behavior, which may not be desirable.

This change extracts the logic from ReflectionReactDelegateFactory to create the IGenericDelegate, and adds support for generic delegates where the instance isn't known up-front. We need this because the ViewManager responsible for creating all the PropertySetters only holds a reference to the ShadowNode type, not the ShadowNode instance itself.

- Code supports multiple top level CoreApplicationView views (each with its own dispatcher thread) in UWP. 
- There is still a ""main dispatcher"" corresponding to the MainView.Dispatcher. Lifecycle events should still be delivered on this dispatcher by the hosting app.
- Entry-point wise the old mechanisms (ReactPage & ReactNativeHost) still work as one view solutions. 
Those who want to go mutli-view have to use ReactNativeAppHost and per root view ReactNativeViewHost (one CoreApplicationView can contain more than one root view).
- All the root views share same instance of JS engine.
- The initialization of the shared ReactContext/ReactInstance/ReactBridge/etc. is serialized through an awaitable lock and is done on main dispatcher only.
- One UIViewOperationQueueInstance (renamed from UIViewOperationQueue) is created for each dispatcher thread. Each of these have dedicated ReactChoreographer and NativeViewHierarchyManager objects, all confined within the respective dispatcher threads.
The containing files will be renamed after the review.
- View managers are customarily thread safe since they are basically stateless. There are small exceptions (like same statics used for perf reasons) that had to be addressed.
Same goes with statics in ViewManagersPropertyCache and PropertySetter.
- Made threading in shadow registry more consistent: AddRootNode is now called on layout manager thread, same as with the other methods. Removed some locking that is not needed anymore.
- Reshuffled DispatcherHelpers a little:
	- RunOn* methods are now fire and forget ""private void"" (no one awaits them throughout the code), with a continuation that logs the after the fact errors.
	- Both RunOn* and CallOn* support now an ""allowInline"" parameter.

ReactTextInputShadow uses a measure function to compute text size. We also used to piggyback on that callback to retrieve the computed padding (that we do push to the TextBox controls).

We overloaded the `resolveAssetSource` because of a faulty assumption in `react-native` that URLs that don't start with `file://` should have `file://` prepended. On UWP, many URIs have Windows-specific prefixes, e.g., `ms-appx://`, `ms-appdata://`, or `ms-appx-web://`. Recent changes to the upstream `resolveAssetSource` have fixed this (they now check for `://` instead of `file://`). As such, we can remove the `resolveAssetSource.windows.js` module overload.

a background thread where it creates the 2nd JSRT execution context and uses
it to generate the bytecode, while the primary JS thread is loading the raw JS.

two threads simultaneously).

The fix is to call ClearData from NativeViewHierarchyManager.DropView.

With the current Reject implementations, it's challenging to control the `stack` and `userInfo` parameters. To control them, you have to construct an Exception object which is awkward if the error didn't originate as an Exception.

To solve this, a new Reject is exposed which enables the caller to explicitly specify the `stack` and `userInfo` arguments.

An especially useful use case for this Reject variant is when a ReactMethod calls into another process (e.g. a background task) and the other process returns an error. The new version of Reject makes it easy to forward this other process's error to JavaScript while keeping the `stack` and `userInfo` parameters intact."

For now, we're removing the dead code, including unnecessary queueing on the UIViewOperationQueue (although arguably we should try to eliminate the UIManager calls to `setJSResponder` and `clearJSResponder` as well for UWP)."

The way the JavaScript variable AppState.currentState gets initialized is problematic. It makes an initial asynchronous call to `getCurrentAppState`. The call ends up on the native module queue thread, where it could grab the current app state only to be interrupted by the UI thread running the `OnResume` lifecycle event. At this point, the `OnResume` event can queue a JavaScript call to send the `appStateDidChange` event, which will update `AppState.currentState` in JavaScript. After this, the native module can execute the JavaScript callback with the app state variable it originally captured (`uninitialized`), which will also set the `AppState.currentState` variable. Now the `AppState.currentState` incorrectly reports `uninitialized`.

To work around this, we can queue the call to `getCurrentAppState` onto the dispatcher thread, which will place it behind any pending `OnResume` calls.

Previously any React View resulted in a pair of XAML Border and a Canvas inside it even
if the view doesn't have a border.

This change creates a Border inside Canvas and does that only when some of border
related properties are set, such as borderColor.

This optimization can go even further and postpone creating the Border element until it's visible: if
one sets border radius, but doesn't change other properties, there is no point to create a Border
as it won't be visible. However if later one sets border width, the Border needs to be created
with the previously set radius.

Another improvement would be to set background color and some other properties on Canvas if there is no Border yet. However if later one sets border radius, the background properties must be transferred to the Border element."

Prior to this change, layout was performed on any background thread. Because of this, we had to perform text measurement on the UI thread, which incurred many blocking calls to the UI. This change adds a secondary CoreApplicationView + Dispatcher in UWP and a secondary STA thread in WPF. This thread is characterized as the layout thread, which is only used from the UIManager. All text measurement calls can now be made directly without having to context switch to the main UI thread.

Currently, the native ScrollView captures the pointer before any views inside the scroll view have a chance to respond to gestures. This breaks things like `SwipeableListView`, which uses a `PanResponder` behind the ScrollView to intercept X-dimension motions. This change adds a new prop to `ViewPropTypes` to support `ManipulationMode` on the UWP FrameworkElement. You must set the `ManipulationMode` of the view inside the `ScrollViewer` in order for it to respond to gestures without the pointer being captured by `ScrollViewer`.

* perf(DelegateFactory): Switching Timing and UIManager module delegate factory

A while back, I created the CompiledReactDelegateFactory, which can provide much better performance for APIs that are called many times.

Essentially, rather than making a reflection call, the CompiledReactDelegateFactory emits an expression and compiles it to a delegate that is JIT-ed just like regular .NET code.

There is a small penalty for the initial compile call, but all subsequent calls are significantly faster.

* Fix test assembly glob so tests run in AppVeyor again. Build one ARM configuration to prevent future build regressions. Cache nuget packages to decrease build times.

* Remove npm install and version display.

* Try another directory for NuGet packaging caching to see if that helps build times. Extract some steps from build section into before_build, etc like DotNetAnalyzers project does in their appveyor.yml.

* Try and fix yaml syntax error.

* Cache binaries from ChakraCore submodule build. Do submodule update earlier in AppVeyor pipeline to facilitate this.

* Emplace x86 build for additional coverage.

* Add extra linebreaks to cmd commands, otherwise they all appear on same line in AppVeyor.

* Expand caching of ChakraCore build output, as just bin directory wasn't enough to prevent rebuild. Scope package.config and project.json cache invalidation to ReactWindows directory to speed up front-end of build.

* Update modified time on cached ChakraCore build files to try and prevent unnecessary rebuilding.

* Add some debug output to figure out why it's failing in @rozele AppVeyor account.

* If we are building a pull request, use the appropriate checkout command after cloning.

* AppVeyor needs oneliners for batch commands, which makes it difficult to do branch statements. Switch to Powershell for the clone command.

* Fix use of environment variables and command string concatenation.

* Forgot to properly concatenate branch variable.

When using layout animation, dropping a view can be deferred if the delete action is animated with layout animation.

If, while the layout animation is processing, a parent container of the view being animated is also removed, then the animated view will simply be dropped (even though the layout animation is still processing).

To prevent an exception from occurring due to this behavior, the animation end callback for drop layout animations checks first that it is safe to finalize dropping the view.

When a ScrollViewer is placed in the context of a Matrix3DProjection (which is how translate animations are achieved in React Native), the touch-based and touchpad scrolling behaviors stop functioning.

This PR works around that by using a simple RenderTransform for common cases of matrix projections, like simple XY translations, in which scrolling still works.

This adds support for `Animated.event` driven natively.

At the moment, it works by providing a mapping between a view tag, an event name, an event path and an animated value when a view has a prop with a `AnimatedEvent` object. Then we can hook into `EventDispatcher`, check for events that target our view + event name and update the animated value using the event path.

For now it works with the onScroll event but it should be generic enough to work with anything."

The previous commit included what was effectively an implementation of `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` because it lacked bubbling semantics. This commit changes the direct event names to `topMouseEnter` and `topMouseLeave`, leaving room to implement the bubling/capturing `onMouseOver` and `onMouseOut`.

At some point, as an optimization, we may still want to consider firing only the `topMouseOut` and/or the `topMouseOver` events, as is done in ReactDOM. This would be an optimization that leverages the assumption that whenever a ""mouse out"" event occurs, it should be followed by a ""mouse over"" event (thus subsequent ""mouse over"" events could be ignored).

Likewise, we may want to consider sending only one event type to JavaScript (either enter|leave or over|out), and have the bubbling behavior implemented by a React.js event plugin, as is done for ReactDOM in [EnterLeaveEventPlugin.js](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c78464f8ea9a5b00ec80252d20a71a1482210e57/src/renderers/dom/client/eventPlugins/EnterLeaveEventPlugin.js)."

Previously, the batch processing step converted the entire list of module IDs and method IDs from the flushed queue into arrays. This involved the allocation of an array. This approach only requires the conversion from a Newtonsoft.Json number (I suspect the internal representation is double) to an integer.

I ran a small test script in a ConsoleApp to ensure this was actually a performance improvement:
```c#
var size = 100;
var repeat = 1000;
var values = Enumerable.Range(0, size);
var json = $""[[{string.Join("","",values)}],[{string.Join("","",values)}],[{string.Join("","", values.Select(_ => ""[]""))}]]"";
var jarr = JArray.Parse(json);

var x = 0;

GC.Collect();
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();

var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
for (var i = 0; i < repeat; ++i)
{
    var moduleIds = jarr[0].ToObject<int[]>();
    var methodIds = jarr[1].ToObject<int[]>();
    var arguments = (JArray)jarr[2];
    for (var j = 0; j < moduleIds.Length; ++j)
    {
        var moduleId = moduleIds[j];
        var methodId = methodIds[j];
        var argInst = (JArray)arguments[j];
        Call(moduleId, methodId, argInst);
    }
}
Console.WriteLine(""Elapsed: {0} ms"", sw.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds);

GC.Collect();
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();

sw.Restart();
for (var i = 0; i < repeat; ++i)
{
    var moduleIds = (JArray)jarr[0];
    var methodIds = (JArray)jarr[1];
    var arguments = (JArray)jarr[2];
    for (var j = 0; j < moduleIds.Count; ++j)
    {
        var moduleId = moduleIds[j].Value<int>();
        var methodId = methodIds[j].Value<int>();
        var argInst = (JArray)arguments[j];
        Call(moduleId, methodId, argInst);
    }
}
Console.WriteLine(""Elapsed: {0} ms"", sw.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds);

```

In this case, `Call` was just a no-op, but the performance without deserializing into an array had about a 10x improvement (for a batch size of 100, which I suspect is a bit too large).  For smaller batch sizes (batches of 10), the performance improvement was 40x."

Adds a pointerType field to the native event for the gesture responder handlers. Basically, e.nativeEvent.pointerType is oneOf [""mouse"", ""pen"", ""touch""].  I'll need to follow up with documentation and examples for this.

Adds behavior to serialize button information from the pointer event. E.g., a right-click will result in `isRightButton: true` on the pointer event data, similar to `isLeftButton` and `isMiddleButton` for left and middle buttons respectively. When using the pen, there is `isEraser` and `isBarrelButtonPressed`, as well as a `force` field (similar to the iOS 3D touch API) for press firmness.

Each of these fields are not serialized if they are `false`, which will be the case for the majority of them most of the time (i.e., there is no impact on serialized data payload for touch, but a slight penalty for enumerating the properties at serialization time). *With the exception of `isLeftButton` and `force`, which is omnipresent in all the pointer event payloads.

I don't believe this is a complete solution for right-click handling, but, in theory, building a proper API to support right-click and context menus could be built as JavaScript components on top of these layers.

There seems to be a problem with using BitmapImage.SetSourceAsync. Occasionally, when the many images are being loaded simultaneously, the app will freeze/crash without throwing an exception.  The culprit seems to be the UI thread hanging in the BitmapImage.SetSourceAsync method. To get around this issue, I've reverted to using the UriSource property for BitmapImage. We still have open issues to implement prefetch, which is what @phongcao is working on and should be done with in the coming weeks.

Because we didn't have any implementation for View's accessible prop, some
views were considered to be layout-only which weren't layout-only on iOS
and Android. The specific scenario I'm trying to fix is around touchables
(e.g. TouchableWithoutFeedback). I ran into a case where a touchable was
layout-only on Windows. When tapping it, React Native's JS code attempted
to measure the view. React Native was unable to return a result for the
measure request because the view that was being measured was layout-only.

React Native's JS sets accessible to true on touchables. According to the
React Native docs, ""by default, all touchable elements are accessible.""
(http://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.30/docs/accessibility.html#accessible-ios-android)

By providing a stub implementation for the accessible prop, touchables
should never be layout-only on Windows thus fixing the measuring issue.

I opened issue #557 to track providing a proper implementation for the
accessible prop."

Because the subscription to the image events must occur on the dispatcher thread, the native module calls to ImageLoader are by neccessity asynchronous from the subscription to the image. To avoid a race condition where the image reference is disposed before the subscription occurs, this changeset adds a single-assignment disposable wrapper for the subscription.

Fixes #521

* fix(Image): Prevent race conditon between event and subject disposal

Even with the SingleAssignmentDisposable, there's a race condition between the loaded/error event firing and the subject getting disposed. If the event makes it to the subject, it would throw an ObjectDisposedException. By disposing the ObserverWrapper before the subject, we ensure that no events will flow to the subject after it has been disposed."

VisualTreeHelper is able to find the parent dependency object in cases where the FrameworkElement.Parent property may be null. This is a useful way to ensure we can find the RootView for measurement.

Hacking this helper, however, breaks certain views like SplitView, which currently depend on the pointer not being captured by React to close the view when the lightweight Rect layer is overlayed adjacent to the pane. For now, only using the VisualTreeHelper in the root view search case, however we may want to use it more generally and have a better ""opt-out"" mechanism for view managers like SplitView."

Android supports inline images, and iOS supports arbitrary inline views (that are bound by width and height). We added similar support for bounded inline views for UWP.

The approach required a shift away from the virtual approach that we were previously using for text.  Previously, text was fully managed in the shadow node hierarchy, and used the UpdateExtraData API on IViewManager to funnel the inline from shadow node to the view.  Now the virtual text nodes use proper view managers, although this required that we reduce the base class for views to DependencyObjecy, the least common denominator between FrameworkElement and Inline.

We also had to shift from using TextBlock to RichTextBlock to support paragraphs and InlineUIElement instances.

Follows the react-native-cli model, except uses RNPM as the globally installed CLI and the rnpm-plugin-windows as the seed package that installs react-native-windows. The expected sequence of commands is:

npm install -g rnpm
npm install --save-dev rnpm-plugin-windows
rnpm windows

This will call into the generate-windows.js module that exposes the functionality to run the Yeoman template. The plugin has two additional options, --namespace to set the native namespace and --windowsVersion to specify the react-native-windows dependency version.

This commit also adds some default behavior to the templates to simplify the process of building and deploying from a CLI generated bundle.

Using AutoResetEvent or any other kind of EventWaitHandle is not a great idea because of a race between the EventWaitHandle being set twice and waited upon. Specifically, it's possible for the timer to run twice before the waiting thread observes the unblock operation.  Switching to CountdownEvent instead, which provides much more reliable results."

Decided to pursue an IJavaScriptExecutor after all. The reason is because the IJavaScriptExecutor can be pre-initialized the with React Native JavaScript library, without having any of that logic leak into the bridge or catalyst instance.

The IJavaScriptExecutor implementation uses Chakra, and we included some simple mapping visitors from JToken to JavaScriptValue and visa versa.

The current ReactBridge is a trivial wrapper around the IJavaScriptExecutor, that has some knowledge of the React Native protocols.

This changelist also includes some minor fixes to the DllImports for Chakra, which should eventually be refactored into a library (along with the JToken -> JavaScriptValue converters)."

One limitation of the .NET framework is that there is no equivalent of the Proxy class in Java that is capable of instantiating interfaces and specifying an invocation handler.

Instead of using interfaces in the way they were used in the Android React implementation, this implementation just uses a base class and a settable property for an invocation handler.

The configuration writer is straight-forward, it just uses the JsonWriter from Newtonsoft.Json."
