AppArmor is a very widely used isolator in the GNU/Linux community,
providing an ""easier to configure"" alternative to SELinux. From the
perspective of AppC this is a fairly simple addition (profile data is
not included in the spec and must already be loaded into the kernel).

This feature is required for feature parity for ACI containers with OCI
ones (as AppArmor is also supported as a first-class citizen in OCI).

Prior to this change, the slice of labels produced by LabelsFromMap
could have any arbitrary ordering.

See https://github.com/appc/docker2aci/issues/245 for one of the issues
this causes in practice.

I also renamed the type 'labels' to 'labelsSlice' since, as it was, it
was being constantly shadowed.

This is not accompanied with any spec change since labels in the appc
spec are already a slice, and thus already have a consistent ordering.
It's unfortunate that a round trip of ToMap/FromMap won't be consistent,
but I don't think any callers actually do that currently."

overcoming soft-failure cases, like skipping a single faulty

This is still a quite aggressive timeout, well below the Linux

currently DiscoverEndpoints and DiscoverPublicKeys, despite their name,
returns both endpoints and keys.

Additionally their results are different.

For example: suppose in `example.com/images/app` we have this meta tags:

```
<meta name=""ac-discovery"" content=""example.com https://storage.example.com/{name}-{version}.{ext}"">
```

while in a parent path like `example.com/images` we have this meta tag:

```
<meta name=""ac-discovery-pubkeys"" content=""example.com https://example.com/pubkeys.gpg"">
```

Calling DiscoverEndpoints will stop at the meta tags in
`example.com/images/app` and return 1 endpoint and 0 pubkeys

Calling DiscoverPublicKeys won't find any meta tag in
`example.com/images/app` so will search in `example.com/images` and
return 0 endpoints and 1 keys

To avoid these problems these functions should return just their
requested type. So the user is not tempted to use the other type just
calling one of the functions. This mean that endpoints and keys discovery
must do different http calls.

* Rename DiscoverEndpoints to DiscoverACIEndpoints (for consistency)
* Renamed Keys to PublicKeys. This also changes the actool discovery output.

* fix actool that used only DiscoverEndpoints to also get discovery
keys.

* Remove appending of previously discovered endpoint and keys since I
can't find a logic in it (simplyfing various functions).

* Rework tests to check also this and other kind of problems and be more fine grained."

jonboulle,2015-12-25 22:26:28,https://api.github.com/repos/appc/spec/git/commits/2304a174e014380b7aa803187444f15491daf4fa,2304a174e014380b7aa803187444f15491daf4fa,"spec/discovery: remove Simple Discovery entirely

The value of Simple Discovery has always been somewhat dubious, and most
implementations of the spec (`apcera/kurma`, `3ofcoins/jetpack`,
`coreos/rkt`) never actually implemented it. On the other hand, meta
discovery is used actively and arguably is synonymous with discovery.

This PR proposes removing the concept of Simple Discovery entirely and
making that synonymousness official - i.e., App Container Image
Discovery is what was formerly called Meta Discovery.

jonboulle,2015-11-26 01:34:03,https://api.github.com/repos/appc/spec/git/commits/c9c118c75028e9f3918fd0563b0c432b53354ecc,c9c118c75028e9f3918fd0563b0c432b53354ecc,"schema/types: rework empty volume type code

tl;dr: this patch:
- fixes a panic in the Volume type's String() method
- ensures that the serialization of a Volume to/from a string is
  reversible - i.e., `s == VolumeFromString(s).String()`

Full details:

The `Volume` type is polymorphic; it can be of several different Kinds,
and for each Kind only a select few fields are valid. When new fields
(`mode`, `uid`, `gid`) were added to the `empty` volume Kind (via
26af7cefe402259b348fdfa2299d8d2e0a595e2e), they were simply added as new
fields. However, this means that Volume structs of Kinds for which those
fields are not valid (e.g. the `host` Kind) would necessarily have
values set in those fields - since in Go any fields will be
automatically set to their zero value. To mitigate this, the previous
code set special sentinel values to those fields (e.g. -1 to the
`uid`/`mode` fields) to indicate that they were ""unset""; but this is
slightly awkward since it necessitates manually setting those sentinel
values at certain points.

This patch instead change those fields to be pointers, so that it is
trivially possible to determine whether or not those fields are really
set, and disambiguate from the zeroed value case. This also means that a
""zeroed"" Volume type is really unset and does not need modification to
set the sentinels appropriately.

Another change is in how exactly a Volume type is serialized to a
string. `String()` previously attempted to dereference the `readOnly`
field even if it was not necessarily set. Even though such a nil
dereference would ordinarily cause the Go runtime to panic, the
`fmt.Printf` function (and friends) uses a `recover()` to actually
_catch_ any panic occurred, so instead this results in a weird panic
trace _within the returned string_, but business otherwise continues as
usual (smdh).

As well as fixing this panic (by checking the pointer before
dereferencing), we now also construct the serialized Volume string
piece-by-piece, only if fields are set; for example, if an `empty`
Volume's `mode` field is set to the default value, we will omit it from
the serialized string."

Appc label values can be arbitrary strings, so they might need to be
escaped to become a valid URL label.

The problem arose when the ""version"" label has a value like
""0.8.1+git734734"", where the ""+"" is a reserved char as noted in RFC
3986, section 2.2.

The function still has some limitations wrt. label values, though.
Mention them in its documentation. I resisted the temptation of
recommending escaping the label values beforehand - if developer has
label values as separate strings then there is little point in using
NewAppFromString anyway. Also, to be frank, we are a bit smart about
equal signs (we split the part to a label and a value only by first
equal sign), but let's not advertise that - no need to bother
developer with unnecessary details."

Use # verb for printing data structures - the + verb does not
differentiate between nil slice and empty slice, which leads to
confusing error messages (see
https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12780).

Add a function returning a JSON snippet for some extra field - I was
always forgetting about adding the trailing comma.

Rename some extra fields to really bogus names (goblins, trolls and
stuff) to be sure we do not test valid fields (like mounts, ports).

Replace the empty image variables with images with valid names and id.

In order to support the use case of mounting at an arbitrary location
inside of the app rootfs we remove the ""merge table"" between app
mountPoint and volumes. Before, if someone wanted to simply mount over
say /var/log with a volume and that wasn't offered as a mountPoint by
the app the entire app section would need to be overridden.

This does not remove the mountPoint name or volume name so if a runtime
wishes to have this volume/mountPoint map it may still be implemented in
the runtime UX.

This concern was brought up by @thockin in #364."

Consequently NewCompressedTarReader must implement a Close method needed to

Now aci.md ""Dependency Matching"" chapter explains how dependency's name and
labels are used for discovery and then compared to the name and labels in the
Image Manifest of the retrieved image.

This labels matching should be done for every discovery.

This patch moves the labels matching part to discovery, and keeps in ""Dependency
Matching"" the additional ImageID check.

From the logical point of view of ""Dependency Matching"" this means that now labels
matching is done before ImageID matching since it's included in the discovery
logic."

This changes the HTTP handling within the discovery package to make its
http.Client an exported field. This has a couple of use cases where consumers
of the package may want to customize the handling, such as:

* Adjusting the dial handler with custom timeouts
* Altering the http.Transport on the client for testing outside of the
  discovery package.
* Altering the proxy used for discovery requests without setting altering the
  proxy settings for the whole process.

This also updates the internal test handling to use an internal interface that
is used to wrap http.Client.Get(). With this, the way the existing tests were
mocking out requests is preserved."

Using container's IP for identify is problematic because:
1. It places a burden on the network impl to protect against IP spoofing
2. It prohibits the container from sharing the network with the host.
3. It makes it impossible to have a central metadata service if the
nodes are behind a NAT.

The use of an authorization token removes these constraints.
It is not required but the note points out how a token can be
embedded in AC_METADATA_URL.

This proposes a clarification of the handling of the ""user"" and ""group"" fields
and how the values should be handled within the execution environment.

Existing convention was that a user/group value of a numerical string would be
treated as the UID/GID. POSIX standard allows for a username to be all
numbers.

To account for this, the recommendation is that the user/group fields should
always be resolved with /etc/passwd or /etc/group first. If a valid entry is
not found, then it should treat the user/group string as the UID/GID if the
string is all numerical.

Fixes #231

After consulting with ARM engineers, it seems the most sensible approach
to architectures pre-aarch64 is to support the two endian variants of
ARMv7: `armv7l` for little-endian and `armv7b` for big-endian.

These also correspond to the output of `uname -m` on Linux systems.

This avoids the somewhat arbitrary armel/armhf/armv7 distinctions
(partly by not accounting for architectures older than ARMv7)."

Since 9aafd97 landed, app references within a pod gained a name field
that is distinct from the name of the underlying image. However, the
spec did not address whether this field needed to be unique, which made
it unclear as to how to facilitate e.g. multiple apps within a pod using
the same image.

This makes the name field a) required, and b) unique within a pod.

Accordingly, apps in a running pod can now be uniquely, globally
identified by the combination of Pod UUID + name.

Following on from #150, this is the next iteration at an attempt to
introduce the concept of pods.

Following the most recent discussion on the topic, this patch attempts
to simplify things greatly by removing the ContainerRuntimeManifest
entirely and settling instead on a single PodManifest.

To achieve this, we give the PodManifest a dual purpose: it is both a
_deployable template_ (which can be used to stamp out instances of
pods) which before execution must be resolved into a final/reified
version. The allowed reified versions are a _subset_ of the template
versions; for example, app references in the reified version of a Pod
Manifest MUST be deterministic and contain image IDs (i.e. they cannot
rely on labels and dependency matching).

An important distinction from the previous CRM model is that a reified
PodManifest no longer _necessarily_ includes runtime information
specific to the executor (i.e., the UUID). It is hence possible that a
fully reified pod could be passed around as a deployable unit to
different executors.

This patch also goes to some length to eliminate the (frustratingly
ambiguous) word ""container"" from the spec, except for in qualified
contexts (e.g. ""App Container Image"")."

The tar Header.Name (for example with gnu tar) can start with ./ (for example
./manifest). In this case ManifestFromImage will fail.

Plus, I noticed that the error was strange: unexpected error EOF. This is due
to the io.EOF error not being handled. So I rewrote the code to handle it (now
it's similar to github.com/coreos/rocket/pkg/tar.ExtractTar)."

setting expectation that the service will be on a
particular IP. From the impl point of view, it may
be much easier to not have it listen on a particular
link-local address."

Add the concept of a mountPoint to the CRM and remove the idea that a volume
""fulfills"" app mountPoints. The fulfills concept we troublesome because it was
putting the binding of a volume to a name at image/definition time instead of
runtime.

On the command line you could imagine it working something like this:

```
ace run
 example.com/webapp
 --volume ssl-share,type=empty
 example.com/ssl-key-downloader
 --mount ssl-share=example.com/ssl-key-downloader:ssl-out

Set was acting on an Annotations value instead of a pointer, which is never
going to work for obvious reasons. This changes the receiver to a
pointer and corrects the logic to properly set the value in-place if
necessary.

Also adds a test case for Annotations.Set which should have been there
all along and catches this issue.

The versioning of the spec should be decoupled from that of the golang
schema and tooling (e.g. `actool` and the ACE validator). This patch
introduces a `VERSION` file in the root of the repo to encapsulate the
canonical spec version. For now, the golang version is tied to this
version (enforced through the `test` script), but in future they may
diverge (if for example the tooling moves to its own repo).

This change also introduces a `+git` suffix to the version to reflect
the real state of things and avoid confusion with the actual 0.1.1
release.

Introduced a map of valid OS/architecture combinations to allow
implementations supporting platforms other than linux/amd64. I can't
figure out at the moment how to warn rather than fail during JSON
validation without resorting to ""just print to stderr"" approach. A
workaround for an implementation would be to add own values to the
`ValidOSArch` map, but this would still not allow full flexibility.

Additionally fixed a typo in Labels.UnmarshalJSON that prevented the
validation from actually being executed (an empty `l` Labels were
validated, rather than deserialized `nl`).

Improves #6 (not a full fix, as unlisted combinations still fail)"

Currently the ACI spec leverages sha256 as the default digest format, which
is not as performant on 64-bit systems. A modern 64-bit processor can compute
a SHA-512 hash in about 50-75% of the time it takes to create a SHA-256 hash.
(This is because SHA-512 primarily uses 64-bit data types.) Considering that
container images can become rather large, this is substantial.

Requiring users to specify an `-app-manifest` [sic] made some sense when
we also had the concept of filesets, but is now of dubious utility. It
seems simpler to simply require people to pass a valid Image Layout to
`actool build`.

- Introduce --no-compression flag to `actool build` to allow users to
  disable the automatic gzip compression
- Handle errors while walking/building the tar. Previously
  this was doing things like attempting to copy the contents of a
  directory as a file into the tar, and silently failing.
- Convert all lingering references to app-manifests to image manifests
- Use shared consts for the locations of the image manifest/rootfs in
  the layout
- Remove relative-rootfs notion from the tar walker (and command line)
  since this no longer applies if users must supply an Image Layout
- Properly close file handles during validation of an Image Layout
  directory
- Remove deprecated/unused validateImageManifest function"
