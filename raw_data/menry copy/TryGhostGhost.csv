requires https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-Admin/pull/1293

- updates `oembed` endpoint behaviour
  - if an oembed provider is not found then we use `metascraper` to populate a metadata object
  - when metadata is returned rather than an oembed response the payload will look like this:
    ```json
    {
        ""url"": ""..."",
        ""type"": ""bookmark"",
        ""metadata"": {
            ""url"": ""..."",
            ""title"": ""..."",
            ""description"": ""..."",
            ""author"": ""..."",
            ""publisher"": ""..."",
            ""thumbnail"": ""..."",
            ""icon"": ""...""
        }
    }
    ```
- adds a `bookmark` card which generates output for the bookmark card:
  ```html
  <figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card"">
    <a href=""[URL]"" class=""kg-bookmark-container"">
      <div class=""kg-bookmark-content"">

closes #10531

- Adds space when encountering closing </p> and <br> tags
- The mobiledoc-to-html conversion produces these tags in this exact
syntax, so there is no need to account for more cases like additional spaces or alternative syntax like  <br />
- Added test cases that cover spacing use-casei
- Changed some existing tests to contain more close-to-real-world markup
- The downside of this approach is generating multiple spaces in case there are empty paragraphs in the markup. The same concern is true for current ""new line"" substitution:
> excerpt.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)+/gm, ' ')
but it never has been a concern as in real world when multiple spaces are used inside of the `<p>` tag they are rendered as single space."

no issue

- we recently started wrapping rollbacks in transactions (https://github.com/TryGhost/knex-migrator/pull/161)
- in a number of migrations we were calling `model.destroy()` without passing through the options which includes the current transaction
- for models which are using `bookshelf-relations` this could result in an internal `SQLITE_BUSY: database is locked` error because it tries to run queries against tables that have been locked by previous queries in the transaction
- by passing through the options when calling `.destroy()` it allows the `bookshelf-relations` to re-use the same transction avoiding the database lock problems"

The previous version of url-utils's absoluteToRelative function had some
implicit behaviour that was relied on here. Namely that when passed an

we would end up calling the `replace` method on `null` - this would
throw an error and cause the subscribers app to enter the error handling
- which was desired behaviour.

- Added Ghost Scheduler Integration fixture
- Added fixture for permissions for post publish action
- Migrated getScheduled method to v2

- ""Reduced the amount of things we expose to the outside world""
- ""Made this a nice clean sensible API we can all understand!"" - by @ErisDS
- Cleaned exposed methods from themes module
- Removed unused storage getter
- Removed list method
- Removed validate method
- Renamed Storage to ThemeStorage
  - Named the file the same way the class defined inside of it is named
  - Naming was conflicting with coming rename of  `settings` -> `storage`
- Renamed theme settings to storage"

* Installed @tryghost/members-api@0.2.0

refs #10886

This will allow us to mount one router rather than having a static and
api router.

* Added members v2 api directory

refs #10886

This brings the members api more inline with how the rest of the apis
work within Ghost.

* Mounted the members api app to the api route

closes #10886

This successfully mounts the api and the static pages to the
/api/v2/members/ URL.

* Installed @tryghost/members-auth-pages@1.0.0

refs #10886

This updates the auth pages to work correctly with the new mount point.

* Changed membersUrl in members.js to use members api

refs #10886

This keeps the membersUrl lined up with the path for the static
members pages.

* Removed old members static mount point

refs #10886

These are no longer used, nor desired.

* Remove superfluous code from members service

refs #10886

This remove the gateway getter which is no longer used, and the fallback
for members not enabled - which is handled within the members app.

* Updated ssoOrigin to use admin url

refs #10886

This ensures that sites running on a separate admin domain have the
correct ssoOrigin, which is used to ensure only the designated auth
pages are used to hit the authentication endpoints.

Since the auth pages are now hosted under the `/ghost` url, they will be
on the admin origin and not the site origin"

* Updated keypair generation to use a memoised fn

This allows us to embed the members dynamic defaults in the object at

* Added getDefaultValue fn to default setting obj

This will allow us to generate the default values when they're needed

the values, and then calls (if required) that function inside the

- The reason for the test failure was:
- Bump in express version: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/commit/5a316c3c804c3823d0df55359c6e32d8c7333c1f)
- Which included bump of it's internal dependency `send` to version send@0.17.1: https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.0)
- Which had a change in how 'xml' type was interpreted: https://github.com/pillarjs/send/pull/154/files
- Because in Ghost documentation for dynamic routing, we clearly state to use `contetn_type: text/xml` instead of just `content_type:xml` the test was considered to be not up to date (ref. https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/routing/routes/)
- Returning `content-type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8` stays in line with the rest of Ghost codebase
- WARNING: when using `res.type('xml')` for whatever reason in the codebase be awere that express will send `application/xml` header which is not the convention used throughout the codebase"

refs #10571

- Removes dependency on 'context' property being set in error when
checking a theme
- Refactoring was needed to be able to avoid passing checked theme as a
part of thrown error (logic was relying on error having this specific
data in context property). This created a problem where we controlled
the logic flow with data in error object.
- Introduced 2 different types of theme check handling, one behaves the
same way as before, the other gives more granulac control to the caller
to decide what to do with returned errors."

no issue

### Context

As part of updating the theme layer to use members-ssr [here](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/commit/f9899cb8c4815a64f8b2b1b816efd7617a977173), we introduced a case where if `enableDeveloperExperiments` is not switched on, the whole theme loading will crash due to unavailability of `ssr` property on members service [here](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/services/members/index.js#L12). Since we switch on `enableDeveloperExperiments` by default on master now, the issue won't be reproducible locally until explicitly switched off. 

This PR includes a patch fix which adds dummy `ssr` object to members service `api` object and members middleware check on APIs to ensure no crash in case developer flags is not switched on. 

Longer term it will be definitely useful to upgrade the dummy `api` object to trigger on member labs than the developer flag."

The site app no longer needs the members auth middleware as it doesn't
support cookies, and will be replaced by ssr specific middleware.

https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Members-Auth-II-4WP4vF6coMqDYbSMIajo5

* Added comment for session_secret setting

no-issue

We are going to have multiple concepts of sessions, so adding a comment
here to be specific that this is for the Ghost Admin client

* Added theme_session_secret setting dynamic default

no-issue

Sessions for the theme layer will be signed, so we generate a random hex
string to use as a signing key

* Added getPublicConfig method

* Replaced export of httpHandler with POJO apiInstance

no-issue

This is mainly to reduce the public api, so it's easier to document.

* Renamed memberUserObject -> members

no-issue

Simplifies the interface, and is more inline with what we would want to export as an api library.

* Removed use of require options inside members

no-issue

This was too tight of a coupling between Ghost and Members

* Simplified apiInstance definition

no-issue

* Added getMember method to members api

* Added MembersSSR instance to members service

* Wired up routes for members ssr

* Updated members auth middleware to use getPublicConfig

* Removed publicKey static export from members service

* Used real session secret

no-issue

* Added DELETE /members/ssr handler

no-issue

This allows users to log out of the theme layer

* Fixed missing code property

no-issue

Ignition uses the statusCode property to forward status codes to call sites

* Removed superfluous error middleware

no-issue

Before we used generic JWT middleware which would reject, now the
middleware catches it's own error and doesn't error, thus this
middleware is unecessary.

* Removed console.logs

no-issue

* Updated token expirty to hardcoded 20 minutes

no-issue

This returns to our previous state of using short lived tokens, both for
security and simplicity.

* Removed hardcoded default member settings

no-issue

This is no longer needed, as defaults are in default-settings.json

* Removed stripe from default payment processor

no-issue

* Exported `getSiteUrl` method from url utils

no-issue

This keeps inline with newer naming conventions

* Updated how audience access control works

no-issue

Rather than being passed a function, members api now receives an object
which describes which origins have access to which audiences, and how
long those tokens should be allowed to work for. It also allows syntax
for default tokens where audience === origin requesting it. This can be
set to undefined or null to disable this functionality.

{
    ""http://site.com"": {
        ""http://site.com"": {
            tokenLength: '5m'
        },
        ""http://othersite.com"": {
            tokenLength: '1h'
        }
    },
    ""*"": {
        tokenLength: '30m'
    }
}

* Updated members service to use access control feature

no-issue

This also cleans up a lot of unecessary variable definitions, and some
other minor cleanups.

* Added status code to auth pages html response

no-issue

This was missing, probably default but better to be explicit

* Updated gateway to have membersApiUrl from config

no-issue

Previously we were parsing the url, this was not very safe as we can
have Ghost hosted on a subdomain, and this would have failed.

* Added issuer to public config for members

no-issue

This can be used to request SSR tokens in the client

* Fixed path for gateway bundle

no-issue

* Updated settings model tests

no-issue

* Revert ""Removed stripe from default payment processor""

This reverts commit 1d88d9b6d73a10091070bcc1b7f5779d071c7845.

no issue

- Admin API v2 returned /404/, see comment in code base:

/**
* CASE: admin api should serve preview urls
*
* @NOTE
* The url service has no clue of the draft/scheduled concept. It only generates urls for published resources.
* Adding a hardcoded fallback into the url service feels wrong IMO.
*
* Imagine the site won't be part of core and core does not serve urls anymore.
* Core needs to offer a preview API, which returns draft posts.
* That means the url is no longer /p/:uuid, it's e.g. GET /api/v2/content/preview/:uuid/.
* /p/ is a concept of the site, not of core.
*
* The site is not aware of existing drafts. It won't be able to get the uuid.
*
* Needs further discussion.

closes #10595

* Added breaking test for img-url helper

Input from the content API was absolute, adding this test to verify my fix

* Updated existing test to breaking test for img-url

Had made a dumb assumption when building images sizes, this updates the
test to fail so we can verify the fix

* Refactored img-url to return as early as possible

This makes it a little easier to parse what's going on, and it also
allows us to remove the check for existence of the image url in the
getImageSizes function

* Refactored img-url config parsing to clean up core logic

Superficial refactor to make future changes able to focus on what rather
than how.

* Refactored internal image detection into helper

We're gonna need to know if the image is internal or not, when we force
the path to relative, if we pull this out now, we have access in the top
level logic

* Removed duplicate checks for internal image

Cleaning up and moving ""higher-level"" logic into the main function of
the module

* Renamed attr -> requestedImageUrl

Superficial refactor, trying to be more explicit about identifiers

* üêõ Fixed img-url to output relative url by default

Includes a check to isInternalImage as we never want to make external
images relative.

* Returned early if img-url recieves external url

After realising we never want to deal with external urls, we can
continue to return as early as possible, letting us remove checks and
simplify the more complex logic for internal images.

* Cleaned up the internal image logic

Defining the three functions in order helps to see what operations are
going to happen and in which order, we can then return the result of
each operation applied to the next operation."

- allow pagination and navigation partial helpers to have attributes passed through to them
    - e.g. {{navigation header=true}} -> {{#if header}} will now work
    - allows styling navigation to be done differently for different sections of the page
- properly create a data frame, and pass through ""this"" context
    - means {{navigation header=true}} is the same as {{> navigation header=true navigation=@site.navigation}}
    - our partial helpers, have the same behaviour exactly as if the partial was called directly
- this is additive, and improves behaviour"

no issue

- Reported here: https://forum.ghost.org/t/in-version-2-16-3-found-bug/6065/3

---

Admin Client sends false or true booleans for `is_private` key.

The settings table has two columns ""key"" and ""value"". And ""value"" is always type TEXT.

If you pass value=false, the db will transform this value into ""0"".
`settingsCache.get('is_private')` is then always true, even though the value is meant to be false.

We should add a migration in v3 and normalize all setting values to ensure consistent database values. Furthermore, we should improve the handling around settings values in general.

For now, we protect parsing values from DB, which we anyway need to transform the values into the correct data type, because we always save strings. This will protect values being stored as ""false"" or ""1"" or whatever."

We're creating tooling to convert HTML to Ghost flavoured mobiledoc, however we have cards that allow arbitrary content without a wrapper element which means that we're unable to do a 1:1 mapping of mobiledoc->html->mobiledoc. To work around this problem we now output HTML comments before/after the output of each card so that our converter can extract card content correctly when parsing HTML.

no issue

- we have seen random test failures recently
- the cause: deadlocks

- @NOTE: Deadlocks can and will happen naturally in innodb when multiple transactions are running and they operate on the same table.
  	 The challenge is just how to minimize, handle or avoid them.

---

Why did the deadlock occur?

The tests insert posts in parallel.
As soon you insert two posts, we will attach the relations.

The relations are basically: tags & authors.

Both tables use foreign keys:
  post_id -> posts.id
  author_id -> users.id
  tag_id -> tags.id

Attaching relations runs through two stages:
- inserting or deleting the row (Bookshelf-Relations)
- updating the row because of sort order (Ghost)

2 or more transactions can create a deadlock on the target relation table because of X and S locks for the foreign key, which get automatically set.

Refs:
https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48652
https://www.chriscalender.com/advanced-innodb-deadlock-troubleshooting-what-show-innodb-status-doesnt-tell-you-and-what-diagnostics-you-should-be-looking-at/

Long-Term?
- investigate further
- retry deadlocks if we know it's fine?
- drop foreign key and handle in Bookshelf?"

- the model & api layer suffered from missing fields when creating resources
- usually there is only a handful of fields which are required to insert a resource
- the other fields are nullable and/or get defaults assigned
- the API only returned the configured default fields and the fields you have sent to the API
  - this resulted in a response with missing fields
- if you have listend on ""created"" event, the same happend
  - you received a model with missing fields
- we now set the undefined fields to null on purpose to ensure a full model for both cases

There is no endpoint to serve webhooks (not for v0.1, not for v2).

Behind the subscription service we have a Stripe ""payment processor"", this holds the logic for creating subscriptions etc... in Stripe.

The logic for getting items out of stripe uses a hash of the relevant data as the id to search for, this allows us to forgo keeping stripe data in a db, so that this feature can get out quicker."

- the resource_type must be always ""post"", because ""page"" is not an official model (Bookshelf won't be able to resolve the resource anymore)
- the action streams looks very confusion if you see deleted and added actions when toggling the post to a static page
- therefor the easiest approach for now is to only store actions for: added, edited, deleted
- and we will add the context information asap
  - e.g. you will see that status was changed from ""draft"" to ""published""
- we can also introduce extra published actions if we want

refs #9178

`yarn test` only runs acceptance and unit tests.
We will setup a cronjob in Travis and run the regression tests once per day.
You can manually run them with `yarn test:regression`

This separation is just a first step into the right direction.
Travis will no longer run for 10-13minutes.
The goal is to run common API use cases and unit tests in Travis and locally by default.

## After this separation we still need to:

- re-work our test utility
- remove some tests
- define which tests are our common API use cases
- rewrite some tests
- make testing easier (starting/stopping Ghost, fixtures and resetting services or event listeners, it's a pain and takes sometimes ages to fix tests)


---

**Acceptance:**
- common/basic API use cases against the current **stable** API

**Unit:**
- all unit tests (no database access)
- proper mocking

**Regression:**
- packages we don't want to run for each PR or commit
- tests which protect Ghost from breaking components and behaviour
- it is wishful that regression tests are using Ghost's API's (frontend, apps, core)

---

**This PR requires an update to our docs.**"

- fixed all known filter limitations
- GQL suffered from some underlying filter bugs, which NQL tried to fix
- the bugs were mostly in how we query the database for relation filtering
- the underlying problem was caused by a too simple implementation of querying the relations
- mongo-knex has implemented a more robust and complex filtering mechanism for relations
- replaced logic in our bookshelf filter plugin
- we pass the custom, default and override filters from Ghost to NQL, which then are getting parsed and merged into a mongo JSON object. The mongo JSON is getting attached by mongo-knex.

String.prototype.length returns the number of code units in the string (number

refs #9326, refs #9866

**ATTENTION: This is the first iteration. Bugs are expected.**

Main Goals: 

- add support for multiple API versions.
- do not touch v0.1 implementation
- do not break v0.1

## Problems with the existing v0.1 implementation

1. It tried to be generic and helpful, but it was a mixture of generic and explicit logic living in basically two files: utils.js and index.js.

2. Supporting multiple api versions means, you want to have as less as possible code per API version. With v0.1 it is impossible to reduce the API controller implementation. 

----

This commit adds three things:

1. The tiny framework with well-defined API stages.
2. An example implementation of serving static pages via /pages for the content v2 API.
3. Unit tests to prove that the API framework works in general.

## API Stages

- validation
- input serialization
- permissions
- query
- output serialization

Each request should go through these stages. It is possible to disable stages, but it's not recommended.

The code for each stage will either live in a shared folder or in the API version itself. It depends how API specific the validation or serialization is. Depends on the use case.

We should add a specific API validator or serializer if the use case is API format specific.
We should put everything else to shared.

The goal is to add as much as possible into the shared API layer to reduce the logic per API version.

---

Serializers and validators can be added:

- for each request
- for specific controllers
- for specific actions

---

There is room for improvements/extensions:

1. Remove http header configuration from the API controller, because the API controller should not know about http - decouple.

2. Put permissions helpers into shared. I've just extracted and capsulated the permissions helpers into a single file for now. It had no priority. The focus was on the framework itself.

etc.

---

You can find more information about it in the API README.md (api/README.md)

- e.g. find more information about the structure
- e.g. example controllers

The docs are not perfect. We will improve the docs in the next two weeks.

---

Upcoming tasks:

- prepare test env to test multiple API versions
- copy over the controllers from v0.1 to v2
- adapt the v2 express app to use the v2 controllers"

closes #9587

- when `useNullAsDefault` was invented in knex 0.10, it was a breaking change, that update/insert etc no longer set's null as default if a field is missing
- at this time we thought it only affects our test env, because the test generator doesn't generate all fields
- but turned out the importer is affected as well e.g. you import a post with missing fields
- the importer doesn't iterate over all fields and checks if the field is present or not
- as this only happens with SQlite3, we should enable `useNullAsDefault` by default
- you can still disable this option if you want, but not recommended

- if you have more than 999 posts in your database, Ghost wasn't able to finish the bootstrap

- the `<div class=""kg-post"">` wrapper around post content has been removed

Before:
```html
<div class=""kg-post"">

no issue

- reported in the forum: https://forum.ghost.org/t/publishing-with-a-single-post-request-to-posts/1648
- the defaults are defined in two places
  1. on the schema level (defaults for the database)
  2. on the ORM (model layer)
- the defaults on the db layer are set correctly when inserting a new resource
- but if we don't apply all defaults on the model layer, it will happen that model events are emitted without the correct defaults
  - see comment in code base
  - it's caused by the fact that knex only returns the inserted resource id (probably caused by the fact knex has to support x databases)
- components/modules are listening on model events and expect:
  1. a complete set of attributes
  2. a complete set of defaults
  3. sanitized values e.g. bool, date
- this commit fixes:
  1. added missing defaults for user & post model
  2. sanitize booleans (0|1 => false|true)
  3. added tests to ensure this works as expected
  4. clarfies the usage of `defaults`

Regarding https://forum.ghost.org/t/publishing-with-a-single-post-request-to-posts/1648:
  - the post event was emitted with the following values {page: undefined, featured: undefined}
  - the urlservice receives this event and won't match the resource against collection filters correctly
  - NOTE: the post data in the db were correct"

- the {{ghost_head}} helper tries to create the primary rss feed url
- at the moment: no collections, no primary rss feed url
- if we offer the option to define custom rss rules, this function might need an extension"

no issue

- this mock eat already too much of my/our time
- the idea of adding a knex mock was definitely a failed approach/try
- it's too much to maintaince and have not found a module which does this already
  - we have to support any query format
  - this is too crazy
- the idea was to use the knex mock for model unit tests, because if we want to unit test models we have to
  run through bookshelf, because the whole model layer depends on bookshelf e.g. events
- for now we simply use the real database
  - we could use the sqlite3 memory mode, but that would mean every unit test runs on sqlite3
  - something to consider for later e.g. run unit tests on one matrix
  - run the rest on another matrix for sqlite + mysql"

### Dynamic Routing

This is the beta version of dynamic routing. 

- we had a initial implementation of ""channels"" available in the codebase
- we have removed and moved this implementation 
- there is now a centralised place for dynamic routing - server/services/routing
- each routing component is represented by a router type e.g. collections, routes, static pages, taxonomies, rss, preview of posts
- keep as much as possible logic of routing helpers, middlewares and controllers
- ensure test coverage
- connect all the things together
  - yaml file + validation
  - routing + routers
  - url service
  - sitemaps
  - url access
- deeper implementation of yaml validations
  - e.g. hard require slashes
- ensure routing hierarchy/order
  - e.g. you enable the subscriber app
  - you have a custom static page, which lives under the same slug /subscribe
  - static pages are stronger than apps
  - e.g. the first collection owns the post it has filtered
  - a post cannot live in two collections
- ensure apps are still working and hook into the routers layer (or better said: and register in the routing service)
- put as much as possible comments to the code base for better understanding
- ensure a clean debug log
- ensure we can unmount routes
  - e.g. you have a collection permalink of /:slug/ represented by {globals.permalink}
  - and you change the permalink in the admin to dated permalink
  - the express route get's refreshed from /:slug/ to /:year/:month/:day/:slug/
  - unmount without server restart, yey
- ensure we are backwards compatible
  - e.g. render home.hbs for collection index if collection route is /
  - ensure you can access your configured permalink from the settings table with {globals.permalink}

### Render 503 if url service did not finish

- return 503 if the url service has not finished generating the resource urls

### Rewrite sitemaps

- we have rewritten the sitemaps ""service"", because the url generator does no longer happen on runtime
- we generate all urls on bootstrap
- the sitemaps service will consume created resource and router urls
- these urls will be shown on the xml pages
- we listen on url events
- we listen on router events
- we no longer have to fetch the resources, which is nice
  - the urlservice pre-fetches resources and emits their urls
- the urlservice is the only component who knows which urls are valid
- i made some ES6 adaptions
- we keep the caching logic -> only regenerate xml if there is a change
- updated tests
- checked test coverage (100%)

### Re-work usage of Url utility

- replace all usages of `urlService.utils.urlFor` by `urlService.getByResourceId`
  - only for resources e.g. post, author, tag
- this is important, because with dynamic routing we no longer create static urls based on the settings permalink on runtime
- adapt url utility
- adapt tests"

refs https://github.com/TryGhost/Team/issues/65

We are currently work on dynamic routing (aka channels).
An important piece of this feature is the url service, which always knows the url of a resource at any time.
Resources can belong to collections or taxonomies, which can be defined in a [routing yaml file](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/9528). We are currently shipping portions, which will at end form the full dynamic routing feature.

### Key Notes

- each routing type (collections, taxonomies, static pages) is registered in order - depending on the yaml routes file configuration
- static pages are an internal concept - they sit at the end of the subscriber queue
- we make use of a temporary [`Channels2`](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/9550/files#diff-9e7251409844521470c9829013cd1563) file, which simulates the current static routing in Ghost (this file will be modified, removed or whatever - this is one of the next steps)
- two way binding: you can ask for a resource url based on the resource id, you can ask for the resource based on the url
- in theory it's possible that multiple resources generate the same url: we don't handle this with collision (because this is error prone), we handle this with the order of serving content. if you ask the service for a resource, which lives behind e.g. /test/, you will get the resource which is served
- loose error handling -> log errors and handle instead of throw error and do nothing (we log the errors with a specific code, so we can react in case there is a bug)
- the url services fetches all resources on bootstrap. we only fetch and keep a reduced set of attributes (basically the main body of a resource)
- the bootstrap time will decrease a very little (depending on the amount of resources you have in your database)
- we still offer the option to disable url preloading (in your config `disableUrlPreload: true`) - this option will be removed as soon as the url service is connected. You can disable the service in case you encounter a problem
- **the url service is not yet connected, we will connect the service step by step. The first version should be released to pre-catch bugs. The next version will add 503 handling if the url service is not ready and it will consume urls for resources.**


----

- the url service generates urls based on resources (posts, pages, users, tags)
- the url service keeps track of resource changes
- the url service keeps track of resource removal/insert
- the architecture:
  - each routing type is represented by a url generator
    - a routing type is a collection, a taxonomiy or static pages
  - a queue which ensures that urls are unique and can be owned by one url generator
    - the hierarchy of registration defines that
  - we query knex, because bookshelf is too slow
- removed old url service files + logic
- added temp channels alternative (Channels2) -> this file will look different soon, it's for now the temporary connector to the url service. Also the name of the file is not optimal, but that is not really important right now."

closes #9528

These code changes introduce a YAML parser which will load and parse YAML files from the `/content/settings` directory. There are three major parts involved:

1. `ensure-settings.js`: this fn takes care that on bootstrap, the supported files are present in the `/content/settings` directory. If the files are not present, they get copied back from our default files. The default files to copy from are located in `core/server/services/settings`.

2. `loader.js`: the settings loader reads the requested `yaml` file from the disk and passes it to the yaml parser, which returns a `json` object of the file. The settings loader throws an error, if the file is not accessible, e. g. because of permission errors.

3. `yaml-parser`: gets passed a `yaml` file and returns a `json` object. If the file is not parseable, it returns a clear error that contains the information, what and where the parsing error occurred (e. g. line number and reason).

- added a `get()` fn to settings services, that returns the settings object that's asked for. e. g. `settings.get('routes').then(()...` will return the `routes` settings.
- added a `getAll()` fn to settings services, that returns all available settings in an object. The object looks like: `{routes: {routes: {}, collections: {}, resources: {}}, globals: {value: {}}`, assuming that we have to supported settings `routes` and `globals`.

Further additions:
- config `contentPath` for `settings`
- config overrides for default `yaml` files location in `/core/server/services/settings`

**Important**: These code changes are in preparation for Dynamic Routing and not yet used. The process of copying the supported `yaml` files (in this first step, the `routes.yaml` file) is not yet activated."

no issue

This PR adds the server side logic for multiple authors. This adds the ability to add multiple authors per post. We keep and support single authors (maybe till the next major - this is still in discussion)

### key notes

- `authors` are not fetched by default, only if we need them
- the migration script iterates over all posts and figures out if an author_id is valid and exists (in master we can add invalid author_id's) and then adds the relation (falls back to owner if invalid)
- ~~i had to push a fork of bookshelf to npm because we currently can't bump bookshelf + the two bugs i discovered are anyway not yet merged (https://github.com/kirrg001/bookshelf/commits/master)~~ replaced by new bookshelf release
- the implementation of single & multiple authors lives in a single place (introduction of a new concept: model relation)
- if you destroy an author, we keep the behaviour for now -> remove all posts where the primary author id matches. furthermore, remove all relations in posts_authors (e.g. secondary author)
- we make re-use of the `excludeAttrs` concept which was invented in the contributors PR (to protect editing authors as author/contributor role) -> i've added a clear todo that we need a logic to make a diff of the target relation -> both for tags and authors
- `authors` helper available (same as `tags` helper)
- `primary_author` computed field available
- `primary_author` functionality available (same as `primary_tag` e.g. permalinks, prev/next helper etc)"

closes #9520

- it contains a dependency bump of the latest Bookshelf release
- Bookshelf introduced a bug in the last release
  - see https://github.com/bookshelf/bookshelf/pull/1583
  - see https://github.com/bookshelf/bookshelf/pull/1798
- this has caused trouble in Ghost
  - the `updated_at` attribute was not automatically set anymore

---

The bookshelf added one breaking change: it's allow to pass custom `updated_at` and `created_at`.
We already have a protection for not being able to override the `created_at` date on update.
We had to add another protection to now allow to only change the `updated_at` property.
You can only change `updated_at` if you actually change something else e.g. the title of a post.

To be able to implement this check i discovered that Bookshelfs `model.changed` object has a tricky behaviour.
It remembers **all** attributes, which where changed, doesn't matter if they are valid or invalid model properties.
We had to add a line of code to avoid remembering none valid model attributes in this object.

e.g. you change `tag.parent` (no valid model attribute). The valid property is `tag.parent_id`.
     If you pass `tag.parent` but the value has **not** changed (`tag.parent` === `tag.parent_id`), it will output you `tag.changed.parent`. But this is wrong.
     Bookshelf detects `changed` attributes too early. Or if you think the other way around, Ghost detects valid attributes too late.
     But the current earliest possible stage is the `onSaving` event, there is no earlier way to pick valid attributes (except of `.forge`, but we don't use this fn ATM).
     Later: the API should transform `tag.parent` into `tag.parent_id`, but we are not using it ATM, so no need to pre-optimise.
     The API already transforms `post.author` into `post.author_id`."

closes #9085

Fixes an issue, where the client sets image properties to `""""` after deleting the image. This causes problems with the query filter (see https://github.com/TryGhost/GQL/issues/24), as they have to be `null`.

Added a check in the model layer saving method to set value  to `null`, when the property is empty.

Affected models and properties:
- `posts`:
	- `feature_image`
	- `og_image`
	- `twitter_image`
- `users`:
	- `profile_image`
	- `cover_image`
- `tags`:
	- `feature_image`"

- the `validateSchema` helper was a bit broken
  - if you add a user without email, you will receive a database error
  - but the validation error should catch that email is passed with null
- it was broken, because:
  - A: it called `toJSON` -> this can remove properties from the output (e.g. password)
  - B: we only validated fields, which were part of the JSON data (model.hasOwnProperty)
- we now differentiate between schema validation for update and insert
- fixed one broken import test
  - if you import a post without a status, it should not error
  - it falls back to the default value
- removed user model `onValidate`
  - the user model added a custom implementation of `onValidate`, because of a bug which we experienced (see https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/3638)
  - with the refactoring this is no longer required - we only validate fields which have changed when updating resources

no issue

- `isNew` does not work in Ghost, because Ghost does not use auto increment id's
- see https://github.com/bookshelf/bookshelf/issues/1265
- see https://github.com/bookshelf/bookshelf/blob/0.10.3/src/base/model.js#L211
- we only had one occurance, which was anyway redundant
  - if you add a user, `hasChanged('password') is true
  - if you edit a user and the password has changed, `hasChanged('password')` is true as well

NOTE #1:

1. We can't override `isNew` and throw an error, because bookshelf makes use of `isNew` as well, but it's a fallback if `options.method` is not set.
2. It's hard to re-implement `isNew` based on `options.method`, because then we need to ensure that this value is always set (requires a couple of changes)

NOTE #2:
If we need to differentiate if a model is new or edited, we should manually check for `options.method === insert`.

NOTE #3:
The unit tests are much faster compared to the model integration tests.

no issue

- this commit cleans up the usages of `include` and `withRelated`.

### API layer (`include`)
- as request parameter e.g. `?include=roles,tags`
- as theme API parameter e.g. `{{get .... include=""author""}}`
- as internal API access e.g. `api.posts.browse({include: 'author,tags'})`
- the `include` notation is more readable than `withRelated`
- and it allows us to use a different easier format (comma separated list)
- the API utility transforms these more readable properties into model style (or into Ghost style)

### Model access (`withRelated`)
- e.g. `models.Post.findPage({withRelated: ['tags']})`
- driven by bookshelf

---

Commits explained.

* Reorder the usage of `convertOptions`

- 1. validation
- 2. options convertion
- 3. permissions
- the reason is simple, the permission layer access the model layer
  - we have to prepare the options before talking to the model layer
- added `convertOptions` where it was missed (not required, but for consistency reasons)

* Use `withRelated` when accessing the model layer and use `include` when accessing the API layer

* Change `convertOptions` API utiliy

- API Usage
  - ghost.api(..., {include: 'tags,authors'})
  - `include` should only be used when calling the API (either via request or via manual usage)
  - `include` is only for readability and easier format
- Ghost (Model Layer Usage)
  - models.Post.findOne(..., {withRelated: ['tags', 'authors']})
  - should only use `withRelated`
  - model layer cannot read 'tags,authors`
  - model layer has no idea what `include` means, speaks a different language
  - `withRelated` is bookshelf
  - internal usage

* include-count plugin: use `withRelated` instead of `include`

- imagine you outsource this plugin to git and publish it to npm
- `include` is an unknown option in bookshelf

* Updated `permittedOptions` in base model

- `include` is no longer a known option

* Remove all occurances of `include` in the model layer

* Extend `filterOptions` base function

- this function should be called as first action
- we clone the unfiltered options
- check if you are using `include` (this is a protection which could help us in the beginning)
- check for permitted and (later on default `withRelated`) options
- the usage is coming in next commit

* Ensure we call `filterOptions` as first action

- use `ghostBookshelf.Model.filterOptions` as first action
- consistent naming pattern for incoming options: `unfilteredOptions`
- re-added allowed options for `toJSON`
- one unsolved architecture problem:
  - if you override a function e.g. `edit`
  - then you should call `filterOptions` as first action
  - the base implementation of e.g. `edit` will call it again
  - future improvement

* Removed `findOne` from Invite model

- no longer needed, the base implementation is the same"

no issue

- if you import a JSON file with a post, which has an unknown author,
  the target user was removed from the blog
- Ghost can handle this case and still succeeds with import
  - but we have stored an `author_id` in the database, which does not map to any user and won't map in the future
- this can trouble if we add support for multiple authors
  - currently, we only return the `author_id` to the client and the client can map with `author_id` with users fetched by the API
    - if it does not find a user, it just falls back to a different user
  - but multiple authors have to be included explicit (`include=authors`) and we will return a mapped (author_id => user) result
  - it won't be able to find the user, because we lookup the database
  - this would result in an error
- there is in general no reason to import (or store) an unknown/invalid `author_id` into the database
- on import, we show you a warning and you can choose a different author if you want
- solution: fallback to owner user and extend warning
  - it's not a behaviour change, you still can import unknown author id's and the import won't fail
  - but we ensure valid author id's
- updated test
- further more: returning `author={}` when requesting `include=author` could trouble with ember currently
  - it expects the author to be returned"

no issue

1. renamed alias:
  - we have a special alias that does initial setup tasks that are only supposed to be run once
  - changing the alias to be `setup` rather than `init` otherwise it is too easy to confuse with `grunt init`
2. require globals to be installed manually
  - yarn is RUBBISH at managing globals
  - internally we use npm for this (actually we have a managed list of globals) and yarn for everything else
  - by moving this to documentation, rather than a command, we have flexibility to do this differently
  - also explicit globals are better than installing these without the user knowing IMO
3. setup includes knex-migrator
  - do this automatically instead of knex-migrator init being a separate command
  - every other time knex-migrator is needed, Ghost _should_ tell you what to do"

  - useUpdateCheck: true -> does a checkin in the USC (exposes data)
  - useUpdateCheck: false -> does only a GET query to the USC (does not expose any data)
  - make the request handling dynamic, so it depends on the flag
  - add an extra logic to be able to define a custom USC endpoint (helpful for testing)
  - add an extra logic to be able to force the request to the service (helpful for testing)

- Update check module: re-work condition when a check should happen
  - only if the env is not correct
  - remove deprecated config.updateCheck
  - remove isPrivacyDisabled check (handled differently now, explained in last commit)

- Update check module: remove `showUpdateNotification` and readability
  - showUpdateNotification was used in the admin controller to fetch the latest release version number from the db
  - no need to check against semver in general, the USC takes care of that (no need to double check)
  - improve readability of `nextUpdateCheck` condition

- Update check module: refactor `updateCheckResponse`
  - remove db call to displayUpdateNotification, not used anymore
  - support receiving multiple custom notifications
  - support custom notification groups
  - the default group is `all` - this will always be consumed
  - groups can be extended via config e.g. `notificationGroups: ['migration']`

- Update check module: refactor createCustomNotification helper
  - get rid of taking over notification duplication handling (this is not the task of the update check module)
  - ensure we have good fallback values for non present attributes in a notification
  - get rid of semver check (happens in the USC) - could be reconsidered later if LTS is gone

- Refactor notification API
  - reason: get rid of in process notification store
    -> this was an object hold in process
    -> everything get's lost after restart
    -> not helpful anymore, because imagine the following case
      -> you get a notification
      -> you store it in process
      -> you mark this notification as seen
      -> you restart Ghost, you will receive the same notification on the next check again
      -> because we are no longer have a separate seen notifications object
  - use database settings key `notification` instead
  - refactor all api endpoints to support reading and storing into the `notifications` object
  - most important: notification deletion happens via a `seen` property (the notification get's physically deleted 3 month automatically)
    -> we have to remember a seen property, because otherwise you don't know which notification was already received/seen

- Add listener to remove seen notifications automatically after 3 month
  - i just decided for 3 month (we can decrease?)
  - at the end it doesn't really matter, as long as the windows is not tooooo short
  - listen on updates for the notifications settings
  - check if notification was seen and is older than 3 month
  - ignore release notification

- Updated our privacy document
- Updated docs.ghost.org for privacy config behaviour
- contains a migration script to remove old settings keys"

refs #5345, refs #3801

- Blog localisation
  - default is `en` (English)
  - you can change the language code in the admin panel, see https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-Admin/pull/703
  - blog behaviour changes depending on the language e.g. date helper format
  - theme translation get's loaded if available depending on the language setting
  - falls back to english if not available

- Theme translation
  - complete automatic translation of Ghost's frontend for site visitors (themes, etc.), to quickly deploy a site in a non-English language
  - added {{t}} and {{lang}} helper
  - no backend or admin panel translations (!)
  - easily readable translation keys - very simple translation
  - server restart required when adding new language files or changing existing files in the theme
  - no language code validation for now (will be added soon)
  - a full theme translation requires to translate Ghost core templates (e.g. subscriber form)
  - when activating a different theme, theme translations are auto re-loaded
  - when switching language of blog, theme translations are auto re-loaded

- Bump gscan to version 1.3.0 to support more known helpers

closes #8143

Fixed a potential issue (edge-case), where our generated and validated (in terms of check for existance and add a counter) would return a slug, that will exceed the maximum length of the slug fields (191 chars).

This is mostly possible for the post title, which can be 255 chars long and would generate a slug with the same length. This would prevent the user from actually saving a post.

I tried first to determine the expected length for a slug that already exists, but decided that the **easier** and simplyfied implementation is to always cut a slug to **185 chars** (+ counter). This makes it easier to find duplicates and includes a possible high number of counts (edge-edge-case).

The slug will not be cut down to 185 chars if it's an import."

refs #8613, refs #9228

- if you send a request to /authentication/token with `grant_type:password` and a Bearer token, Ghost was not able to handle this combination
- because it skipped the client authentication, see https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/1.17.0/core/server/auth/authenticate.js#L13
- and OAuth detects the `grant_type: password` and jumps in the target implementation
- the target implementation for password authentication **again** tried to fetch the client and failed, because it relied on the previous client authentication
- see https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/1.17.0/core/server/auth/oauth.js#L40 (client.slug is undefined if client authentication is skipped)
- ^ so this is the bug
- we **can** skip client authentication for requests to the API to fetch data for example e.g. GET /posts (including Bearer)
- so when is a client authentication required?
- RFC (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#page-38) differentiates between confidential and public clients, Ghost has no implementation for this at the moment
  - so in theory, public clients don't have to be authenticated, only if the credentials are included
- to not invent a breaking change, i decided to only make the client authentication required for password authentication
- we could change this in Ghost 2.0

I have removed the extra client request to the database for the password authentication, this is not needed. We already do client password authentication [here](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/1.17.0/core/server/auth/auth-strategies.js#L19);
If a Bearer token is present and you have not send a `grant_type` (which signalises OAuth to do authentication), you can skip the client authentication."

   - Disallow passwords that contain the words 'password' or 'ghost'

   - Disallow passwords that include 50% or more of the same characters: 'aaaaaaaaaa', '1111111111' and 'ababababab' for example.
- Password validation returns an `Object` now, that includes an `isValid` and `message` property to differentiate between the two error messages (password too short or password insecure).
- Use a catch predicate in `api/authentication` on `passwordReset`, so the correct `ValidationError` will be thrown during the password reset flow rather then an `UnauthorizedError`.
- When in setup flow, the blog title is not available yet from `settingsCache`. We therefore supply it from the received form data in the user model `setup` method to have it accessible for the validation."

no issue

- we store dates without milliseconds in the database
- our test environment does not use our model layer to insert data, this is related to  https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/7196

- e.g. adding data via the model layer (e.g. via the API) the format is always normalised to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`
- if we fetch the date from the database, we have a hook which sorts out knex returning different formats for dates
- this hook wraps the returned date into a UTC moment date, but adds the current milliseconds on top
- which can collide in tests when you have specific assertions
- use `startOf` to ignore milliseconds

refs #8868

* üìê  Use request util in image-size
- swapped the usage of `got` for requests with the request util

* üíÑ  Use catch predicates
- Uses catch predicates instead of conditionals in `getImageSizeFromUrl`
- Return `NotFoundError` if applicable in `getImageSizeFromFilePath` as the caller function `cachedImageSizeFromUrl` is differentiating those between this error and others.

* üêõ  Fixed ImageObject URL & simplify no protocol URL logic

- Using `ImageObject` as a global var resulted in having the `url` property being the same for all requests coming in.
- The logic that checked for an existing protocol (e. g. gravatar URLs) was overly complicated. Refactored it to be more simple.
- Passing the correct value to `fetchDimensionsFromBuffer` as the population of `imageObject.url` happens there. These are used in our structured data and need to be full URLs (in case of locally stored files) or the original URL (in case of URLs missing the protocol)
- Added two more debug logs in `getCachedImageSizeFromUrl` so it's logged when an image is added to the cache even tho it was returned as error.

* üëÄ  Differentiate error codes between request and storage

* üî•  Remove not needed `Promise.resolve()`

We're always resolving the result in `getCachedImageSizeFromUrl`, so there's no need to return the values with a `Promise.resolve()`. The caller fn uses waits for the Promises to be fulfilled.

* ‚òÇÔ∏è  Wrap already rejected predicate errors in catch all

* Use errorDetails instead of context

* ‚òÇÔ∏è  Support /assets/ image paths

- adds a guard that checks the image URL for `/assets/` in the beginning and passes a completed URL to the request util to try and fetch the image size
- adds tests"

- we can support null titles after this PR if we want
- user model: fix getAuthorRole
- user model: support adding roles by name
- we support this for roles as well, this makes it easier when importing related user roles (because usually roles already exists in the database and the related id's are wrong e.g. roles_users)
- base model: support for null created_at or updated_at values
- post or tag slugs are always safe strings
- enable an import of a null slug, no need to crash or to cover this on import layer
- add new DataImporter logic
    - uses a class inheritance mechanism to achieve an easier readability and maintenance
    - schema validation (happens on model layer) was ignored
    - allow to import unknown user id's (see https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/8365)
    - most of the duplication handling happens on model layer (we can use the power of unique fields and errors from the database)
- the import is splitted into three steps:
  - beforeImport
    --> prepares the data to import, sorts out relations (roles, tags), detects fields (for LTS)
  - doImport
    --> does the actual import
  - afterImport
    --> updates the data after successful import e.g. update all user reference fields e.g. published_by (compares the imported data with the current state of the database)
- import images: markdown can be null
- show error message when json handler can't parse file
- do not request gravatar if email is null
- return problems/warnings after successful import
- optimise warnings in importer
- do not return warnings for role duplications, no helpful information
- error handler: return context information of error
- we show the affected json entries as one line in the UI
- show warning for: detected duplicated tag
- schema validation: fix valueMustBeBoolean translation
- remove context property from json parse error"

closes #5599

If two users edit the same post, it can happen that they override each others content or post settings. With this change this won't happen anymore.

‚ú® Update collision for posts
- add a new bookshelf plugin to detect these changes
- use the `changed` object of bookshelf -> we don't have to create our own diff
- compare client and server updated_at field
- run editing posts in a transaction (see comments in code base)

üôÄ  update collision for tags
- `updateTags` for adding posts on `onCreated` - happens after the post was inserted
   --> it's ""okay"" to attach the tags afterwards on insert
   --> there is no need to add collision for inserting data
   --> it's very hard to move the updateTags call to `onCreating`, because the `updateTags` function queries the database to look up the affected post
- `updateTags` while editing posts on `onSaving` - all operations run in a transactions and are rolled back if something get's rejected

- Post model edit: if we push a transaction from outside, take this one

‚ú®  introduce options.forUpdate
- if two queries happening in a transaction we have to signalise knex/mysql that we select for an update
- otherwise the following case happens:
  >> you fetch posts for an update
  >> a user requests comes in and updates the post (e.g. sets title to ""X"")
  >> you update the fetched posts, title would get overriden to the old one

use options.forUpdate and protect internal post updates: model listeners
- use a transaction for listener updates
- signalise forUpdate
- write a complex test

use options.forUpdate and protect internal post updates: scheduling
- publish endpoint runs in a transaction
- add complex test
- @TODO: right now scheduling api uses posts api, therefor we had to extend the options for api's
  >> allowed to pass transactions through it
  >> but these are only allowed if defined from outside {opts: [...]}
  >> so i think this is fine and not dirty
  >> will wait for opinions
  >> alternatively we have to re-write the scheduling endpoint to use the models directly"

  >> see `parse` helper function
- Bookshelf updates the model with the client data via Bookshelf's `set` function
- therefor Bookshelf uses a simple `isEqual` function from lodash to detect changes
- .previous(attr) and .get(attr) return false
- that has the concequence that dates are always marked as ""changed""
- internally we use our `hasDateChanged` if we have to compare previous/updated dates

refs #8221, closes #7688, refs #7558

üôá  Improve meta data publisher logo behaviour
This is a follow-up PR for #8285.

Reasons: The code changes of #8285 caused error messages when falling back to the default `favicon.ico`, as the `image-size` tool doesn't support `ico` files.

This PR takes the logic to decide which logo needs to be listed in our schema into a new fn `blog_logo.js`. There we have now three decisions:
1. If we have a publication **logo**, we'll take that one
2. If we have no publication logo, but an **icon** we'll use this one.
3. If we have none of the above things, we fall back to our default `favicon.ico`

Additional, we're hard coding image dimensions for whenever the logo is an `.ico` file and built and extra decision to not call `image-size` when the dimension are already given.

I will create another follow-up PR, which checks the extension type for the file and offers it as a util.

üõ†  Blog icon util

refs #7688

Serve functionality around the blog icon in its own util:
- getIconDimensions -> async function that takes the filepath of on ico file and returns its dimensions
- isIcoImageType -> returns true if file has `.ico` extension
- getIconType -> returns icon-type (`x-icon` or `png`)
- getIconUrl -> returns the absolut or relativ URL for the favicon: `[subdirectory or not]favicon.[ico or png]`

üìñ  Get .ico sizes for meta data & logo improvement

refs #7558
refs #8221

Use the new `blogIconUtil` in meta data to fetch the dimensions of `.ico` files.

Improvements for `publisher.logo`: We're now returning a hard-coded 'faked' image dimensions value to render an `imageObject` and prevent error our schema (Google structured data). As soon as an image (`.ico` or non-`.ico`) is too large, but - in case of non-`.ico` - a square format, be set the image-dimensions to 60px width and height. This reduces the chances of getting constantly error messages from Googles' webmaster tools.

- add getIconPath util"

refs #7687

There are four main changes in this PR:

we have outsourced the base storage adapter to npm, because for storage developers it's annoying to inherit from a script within Ghost
we hacked theme storage handling into the default local storage adapter - this was reverted, instead we have added a static theme storage here
use classes instead of prototyping
optimise the storage adapter in general - everything is explained in each commit

----

* rename local-file-store to LocalFileStorage

I would like to keep the name pattern i have used for scheduling.
If a file is a class, the file name reflects the class name.
We can discuss this, if concerns are raised.

* Transform LocalFileStorage to class and inherit from new base

- inherit from npm ghost-storage-base
- rewrite to class
- no further refactoring, happens later

* Rename core/test/unit/storage/local-file-store_spec.js -> core/test/unit/storage/LocalFileStorage_spec.js

* Fix wrong require in core/test/unit/storage/LocalFileStorage_spec.js

* remove base storage and test

- see https://github.com/kirrg001/Ghost-Storage-Base
- the test has moved to this repo as well

* Use npm ghost-storage-base in storage/index.js

* remove the concept of getStorage('themes')

This concept was added when we added themes as a feature.
Back then, we have changed the local storage adapter to support images and themes.
This has added some hacks into the local storage adapters.
We want to revert this change and add a simple static theme storage.

Will adapt the api/themes layer in the next commits.

* Revert LocalFileStorage

- revert serve
- revert delete

* add storagePath as property to LocalFileStorage

- define one property which holds the storage path
- could be considered to pass from outside, but found that not helpful, as other storage adapters do not need this property
- IMPORTANT: save has no longer a targetDir option, because this was used to pass the alternative theme storage path
- IMPORTANT: exists has now an alternative targetDir, this makes sense, because
  - you can either ask the storage exists('my-file') and it will look in the base storage path
  - or you pass a specific path where to look exists('my-file', /path/to/dir)

* LocalFileStorage: get rid of store pattern

- getUniqueFileName(THIS)
- this doesn't make sense, instances always have access to this by default

* Add static theme storage

- inherits from the local file storage, because they both operate on the file system
- IMPORTANT: added a TODO to consider a merge of themes/loader and themes/storage
- but will be definitely not part of this PR

* Use new static theme storage in api/themes

- storage functions are simplified!

* Add https://github.com/kirrg001/Ghost-Storage-Base as dependency

- tarball for now, as i am still testing
- will release if PR review get's accepted

* Adapt tests and jscs/jshint

* üêõ  fix storage.read in favicon utility

- wrong implementation of error handling

* üé®  optimise error messages for custom storage adapter errors

* little renaming in the storage utlity

- purpose is to have access to the custom storage instance and to the custom storage class
- see next commit why

* optimise instanceof base storage

- instanceof is always tricky in javascript
- if multiple modules exist, it can happen that instanceof is false

* fix getTargetDir

- the importer uses the `targetDir` option to ensure that images land in the correct folder

* ghost-storage-base@0.0.1 package.json dependency"

There are 3 different ways that a theme can be activated in Ghost:

A. On boot: we load the active theme from the file system, according to the `activeTheme` setting
B. On API ""activate"": when an /activate/ request is triggered for a theme, we validate & change the `activeTheme` setting
C. On API ""override"": if uploading a theme with the same name, we override. Using a dirty hack to make this work.

A: setting is done, should load & validate + next request does mounting
B: load is done, should validate & change setting + next request does mounting
C: load, validate & setting are all done + a hack is needed to ensure the next request does mounting

- remove requirement on req.app.get('activeTheme') from static-theme middleware (more on this soon)

üö® Improve theme unit tests (TODO: fix inter-dep)
- The theme unit tests are borked! They all pass because they don't test the right things.
- This improves them, but they are still dependent on each-other
- configHbsForContext tests don't pass if the activateTheme tests aren't run first
- I will fix this in a later PR"

no issue

üé® simplify loader - use loadOneTheme for init
- use loadOneTheme for init
- move updateThemeList to the one place that it is used
- this just reduces the surface area of the loader

üé® Move init up to index temporarily
- need to figure out what stuff goes in here as well as loading themes
- will move it again later once I've got it figured out

üé® Reorder & cleanup theme middleware
- move the order in blog/app.js so that theme middleware isn't called for shared assets
- add comments & cleanup in the middleware itself, for clarity

üé® Simplify the logic in themes middleware
- Separate out config dependent on settings changing and config dependent on request
- Move blogApp.set('views') - no reason why this isn't in the theme activation method as
  it's actually simpler if it is there, we already know the active theme exists & can remove the if-guard

üé® Improve error handling for missing theme
- ensure we display a warning
- don't have complex logic for handling errors
- move loading of an empty hbs object into the error-handler as this will support more cases

üêõ Fix assetHash clearing bug on theme switch
- asset hash wasn't correctly being set on theme switch

üé® Remove themes.read & test loader instead
- Previously, we've simplified loader & improved error handling
- We are now able to completely remove theme.read as it's nothing more than a wrapper for package.read
- This also means we can change our tests from testing the theme reader to loader"

‚ú® Add activate theme permission

‚ú® Move theme validation to gscan
- add a new gscan validation method and use it for upload
- update activate endpoint to do validation also using gscan
- change to using SettingsModel instead of API so that we don't call validation or permissions on the settings API
- remove validation from the settings model
- remove the old validation function

üìñ  Planned changes

üö® Tests for theme activation API endpoint
üêõ Don't allow deleting the active theme

üö´ Prevent activeTheme being set via settings API
- We want to control how this happens in future.
- We still want to store the information in settings, via the model.
- We just don't want to be able to change this info via the settings edit endpoint

üêõ ‚ú® Fix warnings for uploads & add for activations
- warnings for uploads were broken in f8b498d
- fix the response + adds tests to cover that warnings are correctly returned
- add the same response to activations + more tests
- activations now return a single theme object - the theme that was activated + any warnings

üé® Improve how we generate theme API responses
- remove the requirement to pass in the active theme!
- move this to a specialist function, away from the list

üé® Do not load gscan on boot"

- what is the difference between reading a theme and loading it?
- how do we update the theme list (add/remove)
- how do we refresh the theme list? (hot reload?!)
- how do we get from an internal list, to one that is sent as part of the API?
- how are we going to handle theme storage: read/write, such that the path is configurable

üö®  database: change hard limits and field types

- we went over all schema fields and decided to decrease/increase the hard limits
- the core goal is to have more flexibility in the future
- we reconsidered string vs. text

There are 5 groups:

- small strings: 50 characters
    - static strings
    - status, visibility, language, role name, permission name, client name etc.
- medium strings: 191 characters
    - all unique fields or fields which can be unique in the future
    - slug, tokens, user name, password, tag name, email
- large strings: 1000-2000 characters
    - these fields need to be very flexible
    - these fields get a soft limit attached (in a different PR)
    - post title, meta title, meta description, urls
- medium text: 64kb characters
    - bio, settings, location, tour
- long text: 1000000000 chars
    - html, amp, mobiledoc, markdown

üôÑ  sort_order for tests

- sort order was not set for the tests, so it was always 0
- mysql could return a different result

in my case:
- field length 156 returned the following related tags [""bacon"", ""kitchen""]
- field length 157 returned the following related tags [""kitchen"", ""kitchen""]

Change client.secret to 191

Tweak field lengths

- Add 24 char limit for ids
- Limited fields are the exact length they need
- Unified 1000 and 2000 char string classes to all be 2000
- Changed descriptions to be either 2000, except user & tag which is text 65535 as these may be used to store HTML later?!
- Updated tests

üõ†  Update importer tests

- The old 001-003 tests are kind of less relevant now.
- Rather than worrying about past versions of the data structure, we should check that the importer only imports what we consider to be valid data
- I've changed the tests to treat the title-length check as a length-validation check, rather than a test for each of the old versions

üî• Remove foreign key from subscribers.post_id

- There's no real need to have an index on this column, it just makes deleting posts hard.

- the new implementation is simpler, it captures the dbHash getting initialised during populateDefaults()
- it also adds an event, so we can do first-run code later if we really want to (or maybe apps can?!)
- perhaps this is hiding behaviour, and there's a nicer way to do it, but populateDefaults seems like a sane place to populate a default setting üòÅ

More consistency of creating urls.

Attention: urlFor function is getting a little nesty, BUT that is for now wanted to make easier and centralised changes to the configs.
The url util need's refactoring anyway.

* üî•  urlSSL

Remove all urlSSL usages.
Add TODO's for the next commit to re-add logic for deleted logic.

e.g.

- cors helper generated an array of url's to allow requests from the defined config url's -> will be replaced by the admin url if available
- theme handler prefered the urlSSL in case it was defined -> will be replaced by using the urlFor helper to get the blog url (based on the request secure flag)

The changes in this commit doesn't have to be right, but it helped going step by step.
The next commit is the more interesting one.

I wanted to remove the forceAdminSSL as separate commit, but was hard to realise.
That's why both changes are in one commit:

1. remove forceAdminSSL
2. add admin.url option

- fix TODO's from last commits
- rewrite the ssl middleware!
- create some private helper functions in the url helper to realise the changes
- rename some wordings and functions e.g. base === blog (we have so much different wordings)
- i would like to do more, but this would end in a non readable PR
- this commit contains the most important changes to offer admin.url option

* ü§ñ  adapt tests

IMPORTANT
- all changes in the routing tests were needed, because each routing test did not start the ghost server
- they just required the ghost application, which resulted in a random server port
- having a random server port results in a redirect, caused by the ssl/redirect middleware

closes #7769

Because Google AMP is bitching around and shows errors in Googles' webmaster tools for missing post images and blog icons, we decided to make AMP optional. It will be enabled by default, but can be disabled in general settings. Once disabled, the `amp` route doesn't work anymore.

This PR contains the back end changes for Ghost-alpha:
- Adds `amp` to settings table incl default setting `true`
- Adds `amp` value to our settings cache
- Changes the route handling of AMP app to check for the `amp` setting first.
- Adds tests to check the route handling and ghost_head output
- Includes changes to `post-lookup.js` as done by @kirrg001 in #7842"

* üõ†  bookshelf tarball, bson-objectid

* üé®  schema changes

- change increment type to string
- add a default fallback for string length 191 (to avoid adding this logic to every single column which uses an ID)
- remove uuid, because ID now represents a global resource identifier
- keep uuid for post, because we are using this as preview id
- keep uuid for clients for now - we are using this param for Ghost-Auth

* ‚ú®  base model: generate ObjectId on creating event

- each new resource get's a auto generate ObjectId
- this logic won't work for attached models, this commit comes later

* üé®  centralised attach method

When attaching models there are two things important two know

1. To be able to attach an ObjectId, we need to register the `onCreating` event the fetched model!This is caused by the Bookshelf design in general. On this target model we are attaching the new model.
2. We need to manually fetch the target model, because Bookshelf has a weird behaviour (which is known as a bug, see see https://github.com/tgriesser/bookshelf/issues/629). The most important property when attaching a model is `parentFk`, which is the foreign key. This can be null when fetching the model with the option `withRelated`. To ensure quality and consistency, the custom attach wrapper always fetches the target model manual. By fetching the target model (again) is a little performance decrease, but it also has advantages: we can register the event, and directly unregister the event again. So very clean code.

Important: please only use the custom attach wrapper in the future.

* üé®  token model had overriden the onCreating function because of the created_at field

- we need to ensure that the base onCreating hook get's triggered for ALL models
- if not, they don't get an ObjectId assigned
- in this case: be smart and check if the target model has a created_at field

* üé®  we don't have a uuid field anymore, remove the usages

- no default uuid creation in models
- i am pretty sure we have some more definitions in our tests (for example in the export json files), but that is too much work to delete them all

* üé®  do not parse ID to Number

- we had various occurances of parsing all ID's to numbers
- we don't need this behaviour anymore
- ID is string
- i will adapt the ID validation in the next commit

* üé®  change ID regex for validation

- we only allow: ID as ObjectId, ID as 1 and ID as me
- we need to keep ID 1, because our whole software relies on ID 1 (permissions etc)

* üé®  owner fixture

- roles: [4] does not work anymore
- 4 means -> static id 4
- this worked in an auto increment system (not even in a system with distributed writes)
- with ObjectId we generate each ID automatically (for static and dynamic resources)
- it is possible to define all id's for static resources still, but that means we need to know which ID is already used and for consistency we have to define ObjectId's for these static resources
- so no static id's anymore, except of: id 1 for owner and id 0 for external usage (because this is required from our permission system)
- NOTE: please read through the comment in the user model


* üé®  tests: DataGenerator and test utils

First of all: we need to ensure using ObjectId's in the tests. When don't, we can't ensure that ObjectId's work properly.
This commit brings lot's of dynamic into all the static defined id's.
In one of the next commits, i will adapt all the tests.

* üö®  remove counter in Notification API

- no need to add a counter
- we simply generate ObjectId's (they are auto incremental as well)
- our id validator does only allow ObjectId as id,1 and me

* üé®  extend contextUser in Base Model

- remove isNumber check, because id's are no longer numbers, except of id 0/1
- use existing isExternalUser
- support id 0/1 as string or number

* ‚ú®  Ghost Owner has id 1

- ensure we define this id in the fixtures.json
- doesn't matter if number or string

* üé®  functional tests adaptions

- use dynamic id's

* üé®  fix unit tests

* üé®  integration tests adaptions

* üé®  change importer utils

- all our export examples (test/fixtures/exports) contain id's as numbers
- fact: but we ignore them anyway when inserting into the database, see https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/data/import/utils.js#L249
- in https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/7495/commits/0e6ed957cd54dc02a25cf6fb1ab7d7e723295e2c#diff-70f514a06347c048648be464819503c4L67 i removed parsing id's to integers
- i realised that this ^ check just existed, because the userIdToMap was an object key and object keys are always strings!
- i think this logic is a little bit complicated, but i don't want to refactor this now
- this commit ensures when trying to find the user, the id comparison works again

- functional tests work a bit different

- some functional tests have mis-used the test setup
- the test setup needs two sections: integration/unit and functional tests
- any functional test is allowed to either add more data or change data in the existing Ghost db

refs #7494, refs #7495 

This PR is an extracted clean up feature of #7495.
We are using everywhere static id checks (userId === 0 or userId === 1).
This PR moves the static values into the Base model.
This makes it 1. way more readable and 2. we can change the id's in a central place.

I changed the most important occurrences - no tests are touched (yet!).

The background is: when changing from auto increment id (number) to ObjectId's (string) we still need to support id 1 and 0, because Ghost relies on these two static id's.
I would like to support using both: 0/1 as string and 0/1 as number.

1 === owner/internal
0 === external

Another important change:
User Model does not longer define the contextUser method, because i couldn't find a reason?

- brute-knex uses timestamp type, see https://github.com/llambda/brute-knex/blob/master/index.js

- we have to options: define a default value or allow null or use dateTime
- let's use dateTime, as 1. we are using it for all our dates in Ghost and 2. it's recommended
- read here http://www.sqlteam.com/article/timestamps-vs-datetime-data-types
- there are some difference, i think the most important difference is that TIMESTAMP changes if the tz changes in your database

- was already extracted as separate PR, see https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/7554

Reset Password:
Was just a wrapper for calling the token logic and change the password.

- the only change here is instead of calling the User model to generate a token, we generate the token via utils
- we fetch the user by email, and generate a hash and return

- first of all: we have added the validation check if the new passwords match
- a new helper method to extract the token informations
- the brute force security check, which can be handled later from the new bruteforce middleware (see TODO)
- the actual reset function is doing the steps: load me the user, compare the token, change the password and activate the user
- we can think of wrapping these steps into a User model function

When Ghost-CLI inits the database of the current GhostVersion (in /current), then it uses knex-migrator to do that.
Knex migrator is reading the .knex-migrator file of the current Ghost version. This returns a relative path to the database location.
The problem: knex-migrator will init the database in the root folder of Ghost-CLI /content/data instead of /current/content . And when you start Ghost (ghost start), it always complains that
that database is not initialised, because it expects the database in /current/content...

closes #4172, closes #6948, refs #7491, refs #7488, refs #7542, refs #7484

* üé® Co-locate all admin-related code in /admin
- move all the admin related code from controllers, routes and helpers into a single location
- add error handling middleware explicitly to adminApp
- re-order blogApp middleware to ensure the shared middleware is mounted after the adminApp
- TODO: rethink the structure of /admin, this should probably be an internal app

* üíÑ Group global middleware together

- There are only a few pieces of middleware which are ""global""
- These are needed for the admin, blog and api
- Everything else is only needed in one or two places

* ‚ú® Introduce a separate blogApp

- create a brand-new blogApp
- mount all blog/theme only middleware etc onto blogApp
- mount error handling on blogApp only

* üé® Separate error handling for HTML & API JSON

- split JSON and HTML error handling into separate functions
- re-introduce a way to not output the stack for certain errors
- add more tests around errors & an assertion framework for checking JSON Errors
- TODO: better 404 handling for static assets

Rationale:

The API is very different to the blog/admin panel:
 - It is intended to only ever serve JSON, never HTML responses
 - It is intended to always serve JSON

Meanwhile the blog and admin panel have no need for JSON errors,
when an error happens on those pages, we should serve HTML pages
which are nicely formatted with the error & using the correct template

* üêõ Fix checkSSL to work for subapps

- in order to make this work on a sub app we need to use the pattern `req.originalUrl || req.url`

* üî• Get rid of decide-is-admin (part 1/2)

- delete decide-is-admin & tests
- add two small functions to apiApp and adminApp to set res.isAdmin
- mount checkSSL on all the apps
- TODO: deduplicate the calls to checkSSL by making blogApp a subApp :D
- PART 2/2: finish cleaning this up by removing it from where it's not needed and giving it a more specific name

Rationale:

Now that we have both an adminApp and an apiApp,
we can temporarily replace this weird path-matching middleware
with middleware that sets res.isAdmin for api & admin

* üé® Wire up prettyURLs on all Apps

- prettyURLs is needed for all requests
- it cannot be global because it has to live after asset middleware, and before routing
- this does not result in duplicate redirects, but does result in duplicate checks
- TODO: resolve extra middleware in stack by making blogApp a sub app

* ‚è± Add debug to API setup

* üé® Rename blogApp -> parentApp in middleware

* üé® Co-locate all blog-related code in /blog

- Move all of the blogApp code from middleware/index.js to blog/app.js
- Move routes/frontend.js to blog/routes.js
- Remove the routes/index.js and routes folder, this is empty now!
- @TODO is blog the best name for this? ü§î
- @TODO sort out the big hunk of asset-related mess
- @TODO also separate out the concept of theme from blog

* üéâ Replace middleware index with server/app.js

- The final piece of the puzzle! üéâ üéà üéÇ
- We no longer have our horrendous middleware/index.js
- Instead, we have a set of app.js files, which all use a familiar pattern

refs #7429

Finally it's starting to feel like a real editor, although there will be another version bump over the weekend which improves the toolbar behaviour and usability, and enables image uploading.

- Added the start of a new toolbar, what we're (well I am) calling the Owesome bar, not to be confused with the Firefox Awesome bar. It's a cultural thing. (google ""O for awesome"").
- The idea of dragging and dropping cards has been removed for now, although the code will still be in there as we will support dragging cards around fairly shortly. When apps are included a better card interface will be required for a larger amount of app created content cards (Oh yeah!)
- Ghost Server now pulls in it's configuration from Ghost-Editor, this allows Ghost-Editor to a) keep cards up to date, and b) define what happens if a card is missing.
- The whole cards in admin written in ember and cards in server written in javascript thing is still very much a work in progress, it's kind of messy as we find the optimum solution (which isn't the current sollution).

So yeah, this is a WIP not the final styling, not the final interactions, not the final anything... :)

Adds a new mobile doc editor which has:
- A new toolbar
- Basic image uploading capability"

refs #7427

- Deleting the `built` or `dist` directory doesn't result in an error, when running `gulp dev`
- Adds default task as `gulp dev`
- Adds abbreviations for the repositories in `gulp setup` task (`--ghost` -> `-g`, `--admin` -> `-a` and `--casper` -> `-c`) to type less üòä
- Installs dependencies on `gulp dev`, if called with `--deps` or `-d`
- Sets `verbose` option nodemon to default (=`false`) to have less unneccessary logging.
- Will do a delete of all dependencies and install them again ('FFS'), if `gulp deps` is called with a force flag.
- Will update submodules not matter what, if `gulp submodules` is called with a force flag. Calling `gulp submodules` without the force flag will only update/initiate the submodules, if the folders don't exist.
- Better logging messages and sequential task handling.
- Removes `gulp-shell` as dependency, as this is on gulp's blacklist
- Refactors code, that used `gulp-shell` to use `child_process.exec` or `spawn` instead.
- Exits properly if node crashes
-----------------------

Tasks available after this PR:

- `gulp server`: Starts a nodemon server with livereload of the ghost core only. No client build here.

- `gulp dev`: [ --deps | -d ] Starts development mode for Ghost, incl. client build and livereload for both. Will also update the submodules if the directories are missing. If called with with `--deps` flag, it will install client and core dependencies.

- `gulp submodules`: [ --force | -f ] Will update the submodules, if directories are missing. Will update no matter what, if called with force flag.

- `gulp deps`: [ --force | -f ] Will update client and core dependencies. Does a fresh install of both (delete, cache clear and install) if called with force flag.

- `gulp setup`: </br>[ --ghost | -g 'branch' or 'pr/1234' ]
		[ --admin | -a 'branch' or 'pr/1234' ]
		[ --casper | -c 'branch' or 'pr/1234' ]
		[ --force | -f ]
		Takes various - optional - parameters. If called without parameters, this task will update submodules first (if directory doesn't exist) and then install client and core dependendies.
		If called with branch 'master', submodules will be updated.
		Calling with the force flag will do a clean install of the dependencies.
		There's no autocomplete for branchnames at the moment üòî

refs #7427

With this PR, we'll get some development tooling magic:
`gulp setup`
Will update dependecies and submodules (if submodule branches are on master) for
currently chosen branches.

`gulp setup --force`
Will delete all dependencies and install them again, incl. submodules for
currently chosen branches.

`gulp setup --ghost some-branch --admin some-branch --casper some-branch`
Will checkout the branches for each repository.
Can also be used to checkout only selected branches e. g.
`gulp setup --admin some-branch`
Will leave the current branch for `ghost` and `casper`, but checkout the named
branch for admin. Will also install dependencies.

`gulp setup --admin pr/123 --ghost pr/1234 --casper pr/123`
Will fetch the named PR of the repository and checkout to this new branch.
Will also install dependencies. NOTE: This works only with an additional fetch line
in the .git/config file for each repository: `fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/*`.
See https://dev.ghost.org/easy-git-pr-test/ for further information.

All the combinations above can be executed with the `--force` or `-f` flag, which
will delete the dependencies and install them again, but for the chosen branches."

closes #7137

Deleting the content from the database runs in a transaction. see
https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/api/users.js#L390

`destroyByAuthor` is one of the operations we trigger to delete all the conent, see https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/models/post.js#L647

The post model has a specific hook for deleting content to delete the relations as well, see https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/models/post.js#L122

This hook is part of the transaction. But the `options` are ignored. `(model/*, attr, options*/)` 
We use the `options` to forward the transaction reference, which we need to pass into the bookshelf queries. So `return model.load('tags').call('related', 'tags').call('detach')` does not forward the transaction and that's why it stucks when deleting the content."

no issue

Fixes a bug with displaying small media types like images or gif. Two reasons for that:
1. In many cases, we only have the relative URL instead of the absolute URL for the media source and therefore, `Amperize` module wasn't able to detect the image size and set the default image size of `width=""600""` and `height=""400""`.
2. Even if we have detected the correct image size, the attribute `layout=""default""` would still make it strech. This issue is fixed in `Amperize`, but it wasn't merged at this time, so I set the dependency on my fork.

Adds `amp-anim` to the `.post-content` class, to have same CSS style as an image."

no issue

Double slashes are treated as a HTTP calls as specified in [RFC1801](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1808.txt). Because of this behaviour the uncapitalise created an open redirect. By removing double slashes in the path we ensure open redirects cannot be created.

closes #6588, #7095

* `ImageObject` with image dimensions (#7152, #7151, #7153)
- Returns meta data as promise
    - returns a new Promise from meta data
    - uses `Promise.props()` to resolve `getClient()` and `getMetaData()`

- Adds 'image-size' util
The util returns an object like this
```
{
    height: 50,
    url: 'http://myblog.com/images/cat.jpg',
    width: 50
};
```
if the dimensions can be fetched and rejects with error, if not.
In case we get a locally stored image or a not complete url (like `//www.gravatar.com/andsoon`), we add the protocol to the incomplete one and use `urlFor()` to get the absolute URL. If the request fails or `image-size` is not able to read the file, we reject with error.
- adds 'image-size' module to dependencies
- adds `getImageSizeFromUrl` function that returns image dimensions

- In preparation of AMP support and to improve our schema.org JSON-LD and structured data, I made the following changes:
    - Changes the following properties to be `Objects`, which have a `url` property by default and a `dimensions` property, if `width` and `height` are available:
        - `metaData.coverImage`
        - `metaData.authorImage`
        - `metaData.blog.logo`
    - Checks cache by calling `getCachedImageSizeFromUrl`. If image dimensions were fetched already, returns them from cache instead of fetching them again.
    - If we have image dimensions on hand, the output in our JSON-LD changes from normal urls to be full `ImageObjects`. Applies to all images and logos.
    - Special case for `publisher.logo` as it has size restrictions: if the image doesn't fulfil the restrictions (<=600 width and <=60 height), we simply output the url instead, so like before.
    - Adds new property for schema.org JSON-LD: `mainEntityOfPage` as an Object.
    - Adds additional Open Graph data (if we have the image size): `og:image:width` and `og:image:height`
    - Adds/updates tests

* AMP router and controller (#7171, #7157)
Implements AMP in `/apps/`:
- renders `amp.hbs` if route is `/:slug/amp/`
- updates `setResponseContext` to set context to `['amp', 'post']` for a amp post and `['amp', 'page']` for a page, but will not render amp template for a page
- updates `context_spec`
- registers 'amp' as new internal app
- adds the `amp.hbs` template to `core/server/apps/amp` which will be the default template for AMP posts.
- adds `isAmpURL` to `post-lookup`

* üé® Use `context` in meta as array (#7205)
Instead of reading the first value of the context array, we're checking if it includes certain context values.
This is a preparation change for AMP, where the context will be delivered as `['amp', 'post']`.

* ‚ú® AMP helpers (#7174, #7216, #7215, #7223)
- Adds AMP helpers `{{amp_content}}`, `{{amp_component}}` and  `{{amp_ghost_head}}` to support AMP:
- `{{amp_content}}`:
    - Adds `Amperize` as dependency
    - AMP app uses new helper `{{amp_content}}` to render AMP HTML
    - `Amperize` transforms regular HTML into AMP HTML
    - Adds test for `{{amp_content}}` helper
    - Adds 'Sanitize-HTML` as dependendy
    - After the HTML get 'amperized' we still might have some HTML tags, which are prohibited in AMP HTML, so we use `sanitize-html` to remove those. With every update, `Amperize` gets and it is able to transform more HTML tags, they valid AMP HTML tags (e. g. `video` and `amp-video`) and will therefore not be removed.
- `{{amp_ghost_head}}`:
    - registers `{{amp_ghost_head}}` helper, but uses `{{ghost_head}}` code
    - uses `{{amp_ghost_head}}` in `amp.hbs` instead of `{{ghost_head}}`
- `{{ghost_head}}`:
    - Render `amphtml` link in metadata for post, which links to the amp post (`getAmpUrl`)
    - Updates all test in metadata to support `amp` context
    - Changes context conditionals to work with full array instead of first array value
    - Adds conditionals, so no additional javascript gets rendered in `{{ghost_head}}`
    - Removes trailing `/amp/` in URLs, so only `amphtml` link on regular post renders it
    - Adds a conditional, so no code injection will be included, for an `amp` context.
- `{{amp_components}}`:
    - AMP app uses new helper `{{amp_components}}` to render necessary script tags for AMP extended components as `amp-iframe`, `amp-anime` and `amp-form`
    - Adds test for `{{amp_components}}`"

closes #7182

When calling `config.set()` in the settings api, we want to set the active timezone of the blog to make it available in our `settingsCache`. But because the `theme` object in the `set` prototype was already set to `Etc/UTC` as default, the `_.merge` function would always overwrite our `activeTimezone` with the default value.

This PR changes the code in the way, that we always set 'Etc/UTC' for the timezone as default, _until_ we fetched our settings and therefore the `activeTimezone` setting, so we can overwrite it.

This issue had not only influence on the date helper, but everywhere in our codebase, where we rely on reading the `timezone` from our config, instead of our settings. The `{{@blog.timezone}}` helper reflected that quiet well, as it would always show `Etc/UTC`"

no issue

This small change swaps over the order in which the app routes, and catch-all `*` routes are processed.

This will have an impact on the behaviour of all of our internal apps. Both the private blogging and subscribers apps have a route where they render their own template. Private blogging has `/private/` which renders `private.hbs` and subscribers has a similar `/subscribe/` route (and in future `/unsubscribe/`).

Because these routes weren't listed in our reserved words list, it is possible for a blog to already have a post or a page that lives at `/private/` or, perhaps more likely `/subscribe/`. Prior to this change, their already setup page would be rendered instead of the app's page. After this change, the app's own route will be correctly rendered.

This is effectively a bug fix, because if you enable these features then you would expect them to work.

Moving forward, this change is absolutely required for the AMP app, because the route for that app is `*/amp/`. If the app routes aren't processed first, then this will not work."

refs #7023

The template can be used for all cases (different newsletter interval, different amount of blog posts, with or without blog picture).

The template can be filled with the following data structure:
- `blog.logo` is the blog logo from settings
- `blog.title` is the title of the current blog
- `blog.url` is the URL of the blog
- `blog.twitterURL` is the twitter profile URL of the blog from settings
- `blog.facebookURL` is the facebook page URL of the blog from settings
- `blog.unsubscribe` is the link for the reader to unsubscribe from the blog
- `newsletter.interval` is the interval in words like 'weekly', 'daily', 'monthly'
- `newsletter.date` is the date of the newsletter issue in a format like 'June 9th, 2016'
- `blog.post` is expected to be an array:
	- `blog.post[i].picture` is the picture of the blog post. There are also conditionals, which change the inline CSS to either show a border-top if there's no picture (in that case the HTML code, that shows the picture is not active)
	- `blog.post[i].title` is the title of the current blog post
	- `blog.post[i].text` is the text of the current blog post, which needs to be cut down to 278 letters, plus ending with `&#x2026;`
	- `blog.post[i].url` is the URL of the current blog post
	- `blog.post[i].tag` is the tag of the current blog post
	- `blog.post[i].author` is the author of the current blog post

Important is, that only HEX HTML entities will work, especially in Outlook. So instead of `&mdash;` we need to use `&#x2014;` and `&#x2019;` instead of `&apos;` or `'` and so on.

Added unit test for newsletter template in `test/unit/mail/utils_spec.js`."

- changes xmlrcp & slack `init` function to be `listen`
- update the code to use `listen` instead of `init`
- changes the tests to make sure that event listeners are not wired up
- adds 100% test coverage

Since we added slack event listeners, the xmlrpc event tests have been throwing an error:
 > Unhandled rejection Error
See: http://puu.sh/phvjZ.png

This is because both xmlrpc & slack are listening to `post.published` events.
xmlrpc didn't require any extra stubbing, but the slack listener did
By turning the listeners off after the tests, we reset the environment to not impact the next event test

We probably need to do more work like this to improve the systems around event handling and
make them more robust"

no issue
- perform `bower install` alongside `npm install` in the `ember:init` task - every usage of `shell:bower` was immediately preceded by `shell:ember:init` so it makes sense to move all ember initialisation steps into the one grunt command
- remove `.bowerrc` file so that the standard ember conventions of `npm install && bower install` inside the client directory work without ending up with folders such as `core/client/core/client/bower_components/*`

This does have the effect of causing `bower install` from the root dir to fail with `bower ENOENT No bower.json present`. As far as I can tell we have not documented running `bower install` manually anywhere and I believe the new behaviour matches the expected behaviour more closely as well adding more consistency to the way client-side dependencies are installed."

closes #6406
- adding timeZone Service to get the offset (=timezone reg. moment-timezone) overall available
- new publishedAtOffset date as CP using timeZone service and moment-timezone to calculate offset incl. DST
- removing timezone-obj transform as it became obsolete with moment-timezone
- reading timezones from configuration/timezones api endpoint
- adding a moment-utc transform to only work with utc times in backend
- when switching the timezone in the select box, the user will be shown the local time of the selected timezone
- added clock service to show actual time ticking below select box
- default timezone is '(GMT) Greenwich Mean Time : Dublin, Edinburgh, London'
- if no timezone is saved in the settings yet, the default value will be used
- showing local time in 'Publish Date' when it's a draft and no actual publishedAt value exists
- Removed the format 'DD MMM YY @ HH:mm (UTC Z)' which resolves to '01 Jan 16 @ 14:00 (UTC +02:00)'
- Changing the date.js helper in core/server for moment-timezone
- Fix timezone select: updates `selectedTimezone` to return the matching object from `availableTimezones`
- Including timezones in test for date-helper
- update to moment-timezone 0.5.1
- moving form-group of 'selectTimezone' further up so
- Tests:
	- Set except for clock service in test env
	- adding fixtures to mirage
	- adding 'service.ajax' to navigation-test.js
	- adding 'service:ghostPaths' to navigation-test.js
- Code improvements
- Changing clockservice to ES6"

- refactors the validation of facebook and twitter input field in `general.js` and `user.js` controller

		- `facebook.com/username` will be corrected to the full URL
		- `user` will show error `Your Page name is not a valid Facebook Page name' for `general.js` and `Your Username is not a valid Facebook Username` for `user.js` as the username in facebook has to be at least 5 characters long
		- `twitter.com/username` will be autocorrected to the valid facebook URL incl. the `username`
	- Example validations for twitter:
		- `twitter.com/user_` will be corrected to the full URL
                - `user:99` will show error `Your Username is not a valid Twitter Username`
                - `facebook.com/username` will be autocorrected to the valid twitter URL incl. the `username`
- updates both acceptance tests
- adds further validation for facebook pages in general settings and user. Submitting a url which incl. `/page/` or `/pages/` will now accept any username followed incl. further `/`.
- adds a custom transform `facebook-url-user` which will extract the username (if it's a facebook page, incl. `pages/`) to store only this in the backend

- don't output publisher for the 'People' type on the author page
- change publisher to a full 'Organisation' for the 'Article' type on posts

Note:
Google's structured data validator also wants image & publisher.logo inside of Article to be full 'ImageObject's.
Currently, it output's an error for them: 'The attribute itemtype has an invalid value.'
However, the spec on Schema.org says a url is valid: https://schema.org/Article,
which is slightly different to Google's spec here: https://developers.google.com/structured-data/rich-snippets/articles#article_markup_properties

Ideally, we would output a full 'ImageObject', however we don't currently have the width & height info required.
Therefore, I think what we have is valid strictly speaking, but we should aim to fix this when we have better image tools."

Initial Subscribers screen
- set up mocked api endpoints
- basic subscribers screen with data loading, infinite scroll

""Add Subscriber"" screen
- uses modal to display a new subscriber form
- validates subscriber e-mail address
- moves pagination from route into controller to use filtered/sorted CPs on top of a live-query so that new subscribers are added to the list and the total can be properly managed

TODO:
- there is currently a pretty serious performance issue where the whole table is re-rendered when the live-query is updated. `ember-light-table` doesn't allow for live-binding and has no options to easily manipulate it's rows using an external interface - it's possible to move the page loading into the component so we only render new rows but that leaves it difficult to react to new subscribers being added through the UI. I believe the number of components used within the table is also adding to the performance problems.
  - most likely solution is to drop `ember-light-table` in favour of rendering the table directly - glimmer should do a good job of fast updates even though the underlying array will be completely swapped out

""Import subscribers"" screen
- uses modal to display an import subscribers CSV file upload form
- displays upload progress
- displays import stats and reloads subscribers table once import has completed
- adds `gh-file-uploader` component (NB. pared down copy of `gh-image-uploader`, ripe for some refactoring)
- fixes subscribers acceptance test failing because fixtures did not have the labs flag enabled

Unfortunately this doesn't have 100% test coverage as we're limited in how we can simulate file uploads üòû

Fix performance issues with subscribers table
- moves the table definition from the component up to the controller
- switches back to manually manipulating table rows instead of using a live-query

This is a quick-fix in that it allows us to continue using the `ember-light-table` component but it does mean that we lose some flexibility that the live-query gave us. For now it's not much of an issue and it allows us to defer deeper performance/flexibility work until we have a concrete need and requirements.

Hook up Export CSV button
- use a hidden iFrame to trigger the browser to hit the CSV export endpoint and download the file

Re-order subscribers table by clicking column headers
- displays currently sorted column and sort direction
- clicking a column header re-fetches the data from the server with the appropriate query params

Fix scroll triggers for infinite pagination + icon change
- adds a debounce as well as the throttle so that we always get a final scroll trigger once scrolling has stopped
- changes the subscribers icon from the temporary team icon to the mail icon"

refs #2459

This includes updating handlebars to v4 as well as other fixes which
will introduce breaking changes to the theme API:

From express-hbs:
- partials must now use the `.hbs` extension, the same as templates
From handlebars:
- Depthed paths are now conditionally pushed on to the stack.
If the helper uses the same context, then a new stack is not created.
This leads to behavior that better matches expectations for helpers
like if that do not seem to alter the context. Any instances of ../
in templates will need to be checked for the correct behavior under 4.0.0.
In general templates will either reduce the number of ../ instances
or leave them as is. See #1028.
- The = character is now HTML escaped. This closes a potential exploit
case when using unquoted attributes, i.e. <div foo={{bar}}>. In general
it's recommended that attributes always be quoted when their values are
generated from a mustache to avoid any potential exploit surfaces."

closes #6102
- removes the `xregexp` dependency
- pulls in the non-alphnumeric unicode list directly from the XRegExp library to ensure the word count helper still takes into account unicode strings

The XRegExp dependency was breaking as new browsers add more es6 support as evidenced in #6102. Upgrading to version 3.1.0 fixed the Chrome ""experimental JS"" issue but was still broken in Safari Technology Preview.

We only use one feature of `XRegExp` in a single place for a relatively non-critical feature: calculating the word count. As such I figured it may be better to drop the 63KB minified dependency and simply copy the result of the compiled regex directly until such time as XRegExp has native support in our supported browsers."

- Eliminates the custom static method `destroy` in the Post model in
  favor of handling detaching tag relations in a single place (the

refs #5091

- makes post context explicit - data.post must be set, rather than post being the default
- uses channelConfig to determine the context for a channel (the channel name) rather than basing it off of the URL
- updates tests to setup the contexts more clearly, the outcome has not changed

Since #6469 req has channelConfig attached to it.
We can use req.channelConfig to determine what the context should be for a channel (the channel name)
This allows us to remove the hardcoded URLs, and means that custom channels will automatically get their own context.
Coupled with removing 'post' from being a default/fallthrough, to being explicitly set, this will reduce
potential context errors, as we start to extend the frontend capabilities"

no issue

- removes should-sinon dependency from package.json
- rewrites all usages of should-sinon to use normal should assertions

Unfortunately, should-sinon has very minimal documentation  and therefore it is hard to discern what is considered a correctly-written assertion:
- in some cases, refactoring to use should-sinon causes false positives
- in other cases, assertions that work written in the normal way fail when written using should-sinon (e.g. getters, combos with rewire)
The additional overhead created by these issues outweigh any benefit from the easier-to-read assertions"

Fixtures:
- Removed all the old (and now broken) 003 fixture upgrades
- Split the 004 fixture upgrade tasks out, each into their own file
- Improved the versioning code that figured out which upgrades we should do
- Added lots of test coverage to make sure all the fixtures are still being run correctly.

Permissions fixtures:
- Changed the code that was populating permissions fixtures to be more automated & based only on what is in the permissions.json file.
- Added lots of test coverage to make sure all the permissions are still being created correctly.

Merging the two things:
- Merged the content of permissions.json and fixtures.json into fixtures.json, but using the new structure from permissions.json.
- Changed to use the new automated model & relation creation for all fixtures, not just permissions.
- The only thing that can't be auto-populated just now is the owner creation, I think that's important enough to do separately.
- There were (so far) never any permission updates, so code for updating fixtures stays the same through the merge.
- This results in two clear code paths: populate (fill out a brand new DB) and update (make any changes since the last version)

Test coverage is now 100% across both updates and populations."

no issue
- In Ghost, 'context' means the page or section of a blog we're currently within
when rendering a theme, e.g. 'post' or 'tag' or 'home'.
- In handlebars 'context' refers to the blob of JSON that is tied to a template.
- These two uses of the word 'context' have gotten very confusing, so I've removed all usage of 'context' within the Ghost handlebars helpers, EXCEPT where they actually refer to the current context (e.g. the is helper)"

refs #6421, #6525

- The configuration API endpoint was a bit of an animal:
   - It's used currently in two ways, once for general config, another for the about page.
   - These two things are different, and would require different permissions in future.
   - There was also both a browse and a read version, even though only browse was used.
   - The response from the browse was being artificially turned into many objects, when its really just one with multiple keys
- The new version treats each type of config as a different single object with several keys
- The new version therefore only has a 'read' request
- A basic read request with no key will return basic config that any client would need
- A read request with the about key returns the about config
- A read request with a different key could therefore return some other config"

Having different visuals based around if a radio/checkbox uses a label or not is weird and style changes should use a class modifier.

Improved UI for radio/checkboxes
- Added cursor pointer to radio/checkboxes

refs #5942, #6150

There were a few key problems I was looking to solve with this:

- Introduce a single point of truth for what the URL for accessing the API should be
- Provide a simple way to configure the utility (much like a true SDK)

As of this commit, this utility is still automatically available in a Ghost theme.
To use it on an external site, the code would look like:

```
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://my-ghost-blog.com/shared/ghost-url.min.js""></script>
<script type=""text/javascript"">
ghost.init({
   clientId: ""<your-client-id>"",
   clientSecret: ""<your-client-secret>""
});
</script>
```

To achieve this, there have been a number of changes:

- A new `apiUrl` function has been added to config, which calculates the correct URL. This needs to be unified with the other url generation functions as a separate piece of work.
- The serveSharedFile middleware has been updated, so that it can serve files from / or /shared and to substitute `{{api-url}}` as it does `{{blog-url}}`.
- ghost-url.js and ghost-url.min.js have been updated to be served via the serveSharedFile middleware
- ghost-url.js has been changed slightly, to take the url from an inline variable which is substituted the first time it is served
- `{{ghost_head}}` has been updated, removing the api url handling which is now in config/url.js and removing the configuration of the utility in favour of calling `init()` after the script is required
- `{{ghost_head}}` has also had the meta tags for client id and secret removed
- tests have been updated"

no issue
- add separate grunt tasks for validating all/client/server test suites
- modify `grunt validate` to respect the `TEST_SUITE` env var if present
- default to `TEST_SUITE=server` on Travis
- add an individual builds to the Travis matrix that test the client and run linting as separate jobs
- don't run `ensureConfig` task if we're performing client-only tests

Previously we were duplicating the client tests and linting for every node and database version in our build matrix. Duplicating those tasks a waste of time/resources as the client tests are now completely isolated from the server and so different node/database versions have no effect. This PR is an attempt at removing the duplication to speed up our Travis runs."

no issue
- review use of Ember core hooks and add a call to `this._super` if missing
- fix a few occurrences of using the wrong component lifecycle hooks that could result in multiple/duplicate event handlers being attached

`_super` should always be called when overriding Ember's base hooks so that core functionality or app functionality added through extensions, mixins or addons is not lost. This is important as it guards against issues arising from later refactorings or core changes.

As example of lost functionality, there were a number of routes that extended from `AuthenticatedRoute` but then overrode the `beforeModel` hook without calling `_super` which meant that the route was no longer treated as authenticated."

In `gh-content-view-container` the visibility of another DOM node was
being used to detect if a given view was mobile or not. This means the
UI needed to have layout forced (and DOM rendered) before the content
view container would render a second time. This is slow interaction with
the DOM (forcing layout) and slow for Ember's renderer (it needs to
render the container once with a default, then again when the value
changes).

Additionally there were two ways resize was being observed. The
`Window.matchMedia` API was used for some styles and the `ember-resize`
addon used to detect other changes. Here I've unified around just the
`Window.matcheMedia` API but abstracted it behind a service.

Sizes are exposed as properties that can be bound to or used directly in
templates."

closes #4439

- adds basic get helper which works with the current API
- allows theme developers to make requests against the API
- supports block params and @error message
- includes 100% test coverage using posts

----

The `{{#get}}` helper is an asynchronous block helper which allows for making
requests for data from the API. This allows theme developers to customise the
data which can be shown on a particular page of a blog.

Requests can be made to the posts, tags or users API endpoints:

```
{{#get ""posts"" limit=""3""}}
  {{#foreach posts}}
     <a href=""{{url}}"">{{title}}</a>
  {{/foreach}}
{{/get}}
```

The `{{#get}}` helper must be used as a block helper, it supports `{{else}}`
logic, for when no data matching the request is available or if an error has
occurred:

```
{{#get ""posts"" tag=""photo""}}
  ...
{{else}}
  {{#if @error}}
    <p>Something went wrong: {{@error}}</p>
  {{else}}
    <p>No posts found</p>
  {{/if}}
{{/get}}
```

The helper also supports block params, meaning the data it outputs can be
given a different name:

```
{{#get ""posts"" featured=""true"" as |featured|}}
  {{#foreach featured}}
    ...
  {{/foreach}}
{{/get}}
```

Please Note: At present asynchronous helpers cannot be nested."

- use `transition: left` instead of `transform: translate3d`
- fixes issue where translate3d moves the element immediately then animates resulting in invisible hit areas that cause unexpected hover behaviour whilst animation is in progress
- translate3d is sometimes faster as it doesn't need to constantly re-calculate layout, however in this case the element is positon:absolute and we're only animating opaque elements so the benefit is marginal. Tested on Late-2012 13"" retina MBP and framerate was consistently 100fps or higher."

I haven't been able to find any regressions for this change so far. Can't remember why buttons were supposed to be flexbox anyway. Maybe for icon alignment within buttons, but I can't find any such examples within the app.
- Safari thinks that user-select: all; means a single click should SELECT ALL THE THINGS. Removed/replaced with user-select: text; which makes it behave like Chrome; click and drag to select.
- Increased hit area for ""?"" button
- Removed :active style for post-edit button on content management screen, adjusted position

`notifications.showErrors` was historically used to display multiple error notifications whether from validation errors or responses form the API. This usage needs to be reviewed as inline validations should handle the validation side and we should be displaying alerts for actual errors.

Eventually `notifications.showErrors` should be left unused and therefore removed."

The `icon-x` class got messed up when I attempted to dry up our icon code in both https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/4948 and https://github.com/PaulAdamDavis/Ghost/commit/69fb78150d097d4abb8bfa6d017d674a157a3d0e. All that was left was an `x` in the file.

This adds that class back, so the `icon-x` icon works again."

An SVG (without width & height attributes) inside a button won't display as it should. There seems to be no fix other than apply a minimum width & height. That doesn't feel right, so I've opted for this.

- Remove the `<button>` wrapping `<img>` elements
- Add `cursor: pointer;` to those images (now they don't get one, not being inside a `<button>`
- Remove the `#blog-logo/cover` IDs and `for` attributes. They only apply focus on text inputs anyway."

- adds helper `getSiteNavigation()` which returns contents of

- navigation helper is responsible for filtering and consistently formatting
  navigation data from settings.
- changes `frontend.js`'s `formatResponse` & `formatPageResponse` to return
  a promise with page data and updates frontend controllers to use it.
- `formatPageResponse` now includes a third parameter to allow values to be
  merged into the page response (rather than using `_.extend` in the
  render methods directly.

Related to #4844

The newly added user image in the content list uses a CSS property to
crop `img` tags, but it's not supported in IE or Firefox. This issue
corrects that by chancing them to be background images which can be
cropped cross-browser.

It also adjusts the nav bar user image (previously an `img` tag) which
would squash a non-square image.

Also removes the border around the settings/users/ user images, to be
consistent with the rest of the UI."

Ember.ObjectController (and Ember.ArrayController) will be deprecated in
Ember 1.11 (and removed from core in Ember 2.0). The reasoning is
detailed in the Ember 2.0 RFC.

This PR does the following:

* Updates templates/controllers/views to explicitly reference model
  properties (instead of relying on proxying behavior).
* Clearly delineate where certain properties are being set or retrieved
  from (for example it was not clear exactly where `scratch` and
  `titleScratch` were stored).
* Remove usage of `Ember.ObjectController`.
* Add JSCS rule to prevent future PR's from adding regressions."

Closes #4446
- Mobile Safari doesn‚Äôt support the HTML5 `autofocus` attribute, but
also doesn‚Äôt play nice with jQuery‚Äôs `focus()` and `select()` methods.
- Mobile Safari wouldn‚Äôt automatically select the input field anyway,
so this PR simply removes the ‚Äújumping input fields‚Äù error without
changing any actual behaviour.
- Disallowing the programmatic selection of input fields (with select,
focus or similar methods) is apparently considered a feature rather
than a bug (ref http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12789)
- `autofocus` attribute is now only set on non-iOS devices"

- Created `mobile-index-route` to intelligently transition to a new route on desktops (used by both PostsIndexRoute and SettingsIndexRoute)

 ### Components
- Added GhostSelectComponent to handle async select creation (h/t @rwjblue)
- Added GhostRolesSelector (extends GhostSelect) for displaying user role options
- Created StoreInjector for surgically inserting the store into things that normally wouldn't have them.

 ### Users Settings
- InviteNewUserModal now uses GhostRolesSelector & defaults to Author
- The role dropdown for user settings has permissions set per 3402

 ### User Model
- Added `role` property as an interface to getting and setting `roles`
- Refactored anything that set `roles` to set `role`
- isAdmin, isAuthor, isOwner and isEditor are all keyed off of `role` now

 ### Tests
- Added functional tests for Settings.Users
- updated settings.users and settings.users.user screens
- fix spacing on screens

 ### Server Fixtures
- Fixed owner fixture's roles"

- Refactored `SettingsView` to handle transitions between mobile and desktop layouts

- Added `SettingsIndexView` to handle showing the settings menu on mobile screens
- Added `SettingsContentBaseView` to be inherited by any settings view that is not index.
- Updated Settings templates appropriately to work with new views
- Removed extraneous `active` class from `settings-content`
- Changed settings menu to use `gh-activating-list-item`
- Retooled settings tests

 ### Mobile Utils
- Renamed file to `mobile.js`, since it's inside of `utils/`
- Added `mobileQuery` MediaQueryList to help detect layout changes
- Removed unused `hasTouchScreen`, `device.js` should be used instead.
- Removed unused `smallScreen` function
- Moved FastClickInit to codemirror-mobile"

Closes #2988, #2752
Ref #1463, #2984,
 # Shortcuts via Keymaster
- Added KeyMaster to bower dependencies. KeyMaster is a minimal keyboard
  shortcuts library.
- Added `ShortcutsRouteMixin` for routes that will use shortcuts.
  Currently, only routes can have shortcuts. See the extensive comment
  at the top of `core/client/mixins/shortcuts-route.js` for a
  description of how to implement shortcuts.

 ## Other Changes
- Injected popover service into ApplicationRoute
- Created `EditorRouteBase` mixin for the `editor.new` and
  `editor.edit` routes to mixin.
- `StyleBodyMixin` now calls `this._super()` on `activate` and
  `deactivate` to play nicely with other mixins.

 ## Shortcuts and Stubs implemented
 #### Application-Wide
- `'esc':'closePopups'` shortcut **stub** to close popovers,
 modals, and notifcations

 #### Editor Shortcuts
- `'ctrl+s, command+s': 'save'` note that `command` is the
  `meta` key.
- `'ctrl+alt+p': 'publish'`
- `'ctrl+alt+z': 'toggleZenMode'`"

no related issue

- Updates package.json packages, adding express middleware packages
 that have been broken into their own modules

- Updates controllers/frontend.js to use the new Layer object that Express 4.0
 has.  Requires some monkey-patching as the Layer object isn't explicitly
 surfaced, however it should be safe to do.

- Moved the setup of routes into middleware/index.js because they need to
 be added as a middleware function before the 404 and 500 handlers. This is
 no longer possible with the old app.use(app.router) as that has been removed.

- Cleaned up middleware/index.js to make it compatible with Express 4.0.

- Simplified the way themes are activated and enabled when they are activated.
 The new handling is simpler, yet should still cover all the use cases that
 previously existed.

- The entire flow of activating a theme through middleware should be a little
 more centralized, letting it be easier to read and maintain.

- Moved every routes/*.js file to use an individual express.Router() instance."

* Mailer now only handles sending email and initializing settings. Instead of adding new notifications there, it just sets flags on its own object.
* Mailer now checks for the presence of ""to"". If there is none, it fails. You should really pass a full mail object complete with ""to"", ""subject"" and ""html"", otherwise it's partial content.
* Therefore Mail API doesn't check for the existence of the ""to"", and doesn't get the email from settings and substitute that
* index.js now has a method that adds the notifications. I figured adding those THERE is probably better than individually in every module. It is, as the comments say, can be made extensible"

resolves #2416

This is a pretty large commit but what it's adding are pretty fundamental to the admin app.

- Creates top level actions on the ApplicationRoute for opening and closing modals.  This allows sending the 'openModal' action from any template to open a modal.

- Every modal template lives in 'templates/modals/{{modalName}}'

- Each modal can have a backing controller of the same name that can provide additional control for that modal.  Those controllers reside in 'controllers/modals/{{modalName}}'

- Created the ModalDialog component which is where all the logic for the component resides.  It's not at 100% parity with the existing Ghost modal system but it has the foundation for further fleshing out.  It currently accepts parameters for styling how the modal should appear, which previously was defined in JS files in the Backbone admin.

- This creates the 'delete all posts', 'delete this post', 'markdown', and 'upload' modal.  Some are in more stages of completion than others, but I wanted to just get the foundation in place as fast as possible.

- This also creates the UploadModal component which is a subclass of the ModalDialog component.  The reason for this subclassing is that the UploadModal component directly accesses the DOM and when that occurs in Ember it should remain in a component definition.  It's ready for extending to reach parity.  Note: depending on needs the base ModalDialog class may need to be modified."

addresses #1789, #1364

- Moves ./core/server/loader -> ./core/bootstrap.
The bootstrap file is only accessed once during startup,
and it‚Äôs sole job is to ensure a config.js file exists
(creating one if it doesn‚Äôt) and then validates
the contents of the config file.

Since this is directly related to the initializing 
the application is is appropriate to have 
it in the ./core folder, named bootstrap as that
is what it does.

This also improves the dependency graph, as now
the bootstrap file require‚Äôs the ./core/server/config
module and is responsible for passing in the validated
config file.

Whereas before we had ./core/server/config
require‚Äôing ./core/server/loader and running its
init code and then passing that value back to itself,
the flow is now more straight forward of
./core/bootstrap handling initialization and then
instatiation of config module

- Merges ./core/server/config/paths into 
./core/server/config
This flow was always confusing me to that some config
options were on the config object, and some were on
the paths object.

This change now incorporates all of the variables
previously defined in config/paths directly
into the config module, and in extension,
the config.js file.

This means that you now have the option of deciding
at startup where the content directory for ghost
should reside.

- broke out loader tests in config_spec to bootstrap_spec

- updated all relevant files to now use config().paths

- moved urlFor and urlForPost function into 
 ./server/config/url.js"

fixes #1765
fixes #1811
issue #1833

New UrlFor functions

- moved body of url helper to config.path.urlFor, which can generate a URL for various scenarios
- urlFor can take a string (name) or object (relativeUrl: '/') as the first
  argument - this is the first step towards issue #1833
- also added config.path.urlForPost which is async and handles getting
  permalink setting
- frontend controller, ghost_head helper, cache invalidation all now use
  urlFor or urlForPost all urls should be correct and consistent

URL Consistency Improvements

- refactored invalidateCache into cacheInvalidationHeader which returns a
  promise so that url can be generated properly by urlForPost
- moved isPost from models to schema, and refactored schema to have a tables object
- deleted posts now return the whole object, not just id and slug,
  ensuring cache invalidation header can be set on delete
- frontend controller rss and archive page redirects work properly with subdirectory
- removes {{url}} helper from admin and client, and replaced with adminUrl
  helper which also uses urlFor
- in res.locals ghostRoot becomes relativeUrl, and path is removed"

- adding fixBools method to `server/models/base.js` to convert bools to 1/0 to be consistent with MySQL & sqlite3 data providers (based on @ErisDS recommendation)
- this in turn fixes the check in `server/controllers/frontend.js`, which does an explicit `post.page === 0` comparison (in pgsql this is a `boolean`, since the schema declares it as ""bool"" in `server/data/schema.js`, but MySQL/sqlite3 don't have concept of Boolean, only an integer or bit)

- Previously, the middleware would check that the route on the stack was an empty string, which worked when there was no subdirectories
- When subdirectories were added, the proper route was only set when
  updating the theme
- Because it was only set when updating, this explains themes working on
  initial load, since the stack location was looking for an empty
  string, which is what the middleware was initialized with
- However, once a new theme was set, it was still look for an empty
  string, which would never exist, which caused the issue
- Now, the route is properly set on initialization of the middleware,
  and then the `config.paths().subdir` property is used for the check"

- Promotes config-loader from a validator, to the central place where configuration state is held
- Allow config-loader two means to be told of config file to be used:
  - A preferred first argument passed into Ghost
  - A secondary GHOST_CONFIG environmental variable
- Failing to see either of the above passed in, config-loader will continue to use ""config.js""
- Config-loader validates the target configuration (unchanged) & then copies that object into it's own exports
- Components needing to read configuration now require config-loader to retrieve the configuration state

On both Firefox and Opera (OSX) the user image badge in
the settings page wasn't displayed.
Also, on firefox the badge overlay didn't have the proper size.

I don't know if there's a specific use case requiring a `display:
table` instead of a plain `display: block` but that was failing on
Firefox and Opera.

Using a block instead seems works perfectly (at least on Opera, Chrome,
Safari, Safari Mobile IOS7 and Firefox) regarding the badge size issue.

On Opera, though, the border radius wasn't applied properly to the
image. Adding a `border-radius: 100%;`fix that."

- Updated grunt config for unit and functional tests to remove the test

- Cleaned up a couple of issues with the functional tests that may have
been causing travis builds to fail randomly, including: the start page
is now `about:blank` instead of whatever page the last test suite left
off at, added some checks in the logout tests to ensure they're truly

- There is no need to set the viewport on functional tests anymore
unless something other
than the default of 1280x1024 is desired.
- There is no need to invoke `casper.run` to trigger `test.done`
anymore for functional tests.
- Each test works independently of the rest; registration is handled
once for the lifetime of the test run and then login/logout can be
invoked automatically as desired.
- Mocha tests all utilize predefined, more realistic fixtures when
appropriate.
- Renamed old api tests that were really model tests as appropraite.
- Added example api test for posts."

Fixes #825

- Changes the way the error middleware is delivered in server.js, moving
  all the logic back into errorHandling.js
- Alters error logging to use console.error (probably more appropriate) instead
  of console.log
- Changes error tests to accomodate for these alterations
- Alters user-error and error hbs templates to incorporate stack traces
- Adds additional styling for error pages to accomodate stack traces
- Added logic to parse and deliver formatted stack traces

Notes:
======

- Jslint gets in the way of the regex I've got to use to parse the stack.
  (It cites 'security reasons' which are not relevant in this case.)
  I needed to add a condition to relax it at the top of errorHandling.js
- The stack trace should probably be added as a partial, but I figured it
  was out of scope for this PR."

- Adds new generic methods for handling errors to errorHandling.js
- Initialises generic methods as middleware
- Created error.hbs view in admin
- Error handler searches for error.hbs view file in user theme folder
  and renders it if available, otherwise lets the error fall through
  to express.

- We *could* change the final behaviour to render a default ghost
  template should the user template be missing
- Because it currently isn't possible to require(ghost) in errorHandling.js,
  it was necessary to duplicate some aspects of the ghost path init code
  inside errorhandling.js. This should be cleaned up and moved back

Closes #581.

* Basically adds the client side of node validator, that we're already using
* Validator is plonked onto `Ghost.Validator`
* Usage is identical as to https://github.com/chriso/node-validator
* Has sanitizing values et al
* `Ghost.Validator.error` is redefined, it populates Ghost.Validator._errors (Array)
* `Ghost.Validator.handleErrors` is supposed to print out the multiple error messages, if there are multiple (this is broken due to how notifications are presented `.html` instead of `.append`), and also apply class to element
* The ajax calls are wrapped in an if to prevent network traffic if something's not right on client side
* Added validation to general settings and user settings screens.
* On validation error, optionally adds `.input-error` to whatever element you reference, see below (if `el` exists on the error object). This is the only place where usage is different to the original implementation. Redeclared `error()` function in `init.js`
* Usage: `Ghost.Validate.check(valueToCheck, {message: ""the error message"", el: $('#the element')}).isEmail()`
* The element above will receive the `.input-error` class. `isEmail()` is one of the stuff you can check against."

Closes #282
* Added a new route
* Added new methods
* Triple security!
* Passwords are actually changed
* Also added a change password button, because 'save' has too much baggage.

On security: checks whether you're logged in. Then checks whether your old password is actually the one that belongs to you (gets value from the email field for the email, see caveat no2). Checks the new passwords for === and length > 6 on client and server side as well. And THEN changes passwords.

Caveats:
* didn't add a test, as mocha fails spectacularly on my machine. SQLITE_CORRUPT: database disk image is malformed. Cute, huh?
* Because we don't have / I'm not aware of / could not find a ""currentuser"" variable, I need to get the email address of the user we want to change from the email field. Theoretically if they replace that with another user's email address, and supply their pw, they will change THEIR password instead of their own."

* Refactored the Ghost.Notifications View bundle
* Added a new initialization of the NotificationCollection (hacky, but at least satisfies JSLint). This was needed as the reason the persistent success notification couldn't be dismissed was that prerendered DOM elements weren't picked up as BB Views beforehand, and thus no events were bound to them."

Fixes #291

Incorporated new task into gruntfile which generates a markdown formatted
changelog from the git commit messages of the last 14 git tags, corresponding
to two weeks of nightly releases.

The changelog is saved in __dirname/CHANGELOG.md.

At this stage, the code is a fair bit too complex to be left in the gruntfile
and should be split out into a separate module, but this is a first bash at the
function which can be improved later.

Additionally, several additions have been made to the generator to improve
reliability:

- Now generates changelog based on log output with --graph (thx hannah)
- Grabs tag refs from git
- Added changelog to gitignore
- Added message for builds without any changes
- Ignores any commits which have not been incorporated into a build"
