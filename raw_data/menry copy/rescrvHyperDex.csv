Patch-By:  William Whitacre <numayacto@gmail.com>

Patch against HyperDex 1.8.1 Source Distribution
Source : http://hyperdex.org/src/hyperdex-1.8.1.tar.gz
Patch  : ./hyperdex-1.8.1-authjs.patch

Patch for enabling node.js bindings for authorization support and test program.

Successfully tested against node.js versions

node@0.10.36 (npm@1.3.6)
node@0.10.40 (npm@1.4.28)

Test program depends on
node-hyperdex-test@0.0.0 /home/ww/s/node-hyperdex-test
├─┬ macaroons.js@0.3.5
│ ├── ecma-nacl@2.2.0
│ └─┬ typedarray-to-buffer@3.0.4
│   └── is-typedarray@1.0.0
└── when@3.7.3

No support for `secret` argument. Directly pass attribute `__secret` instead to
create a secret record:

    c.put('space', 'key', { __secret: 'super secret', ... }, put_callback);

Supports `auth` argument in the following form:

    c.get('space', 'key', [ M.serialize() ], get_callback);

Note that the tail of the argument list after method specific arguments was
before taken to just always be the callback. With this patch, existing code will
not break, but instead if there are two extra arguments, then the first is taken
to be an array of tokens, and the second is taken to be a callback."

 - Improved the coordinator-daemon coupling to be more robust
 - Enable nodes to go offline without contacting the coordinator at all

 - Better ruby bindings.  They implement feature-for-feature the same API as

 - Admin library now has async add/rm space
 - hyperspace_builder is a public API
 - Java bindings moved from ""package hyperclient"" to
   ""package org.hyperdex.{client,ycsb}""
 - Updated documentation.  Still a WIP.
 - Datastructures API. Pack and unpack with no knowledge of the underlying
   encoding format.
 - Fix #118
 - Automatically run some e2e tests with ""make check""
 - More man pages
 - C API changed from hyperclient to hyperdex_client to be consistent with
   hyperdex_admin
 - C++ API changed to be ""hyperdex::Client""
 - Python API now ""hyperdex.client""/""hyperdex.admin"" instead of ""hyperclient""
 - Coordinator tightly coupled to replicant.  CMD-line options updated to match
   replicant, and no zombie processes are left after initialization"

This change does several things:
 - Move the code concerning datatypes to datatypes/.  Both the client and server
   can use this code.
 - Clients now perform much more validation.  The server ALWAYS validated
   everything, but would throw an uninformative error.  Now the client will
   always check first, and can return an informative error based on that check.
   This reduces the server's burden.
 - Automatic type coercion is easier to follow.  There are straightforward cases
   for when an empty ""generic"" set can be converted to any other set and it
   does not rely upon the ad-hoc, per-type rules that existed before."

Expected the last c.get(), above, to return:
{'phone': {'home': 4165551034, 'work': 4165551125, 'other': 4165552026},
'last': 'Smith', 'first': 'John'}

To wit, each phone number (home,work,other) should have been incremented
by (10,100,1000) repectively. But, clearly, only the first 'home' number
was incremented by 10. The rest were untouched.

This commit fixes the problem.

 - The append/prepend methods of strings blow up by not serializing correctly.
   Fix:  Figure out where the serializing problem is.
 - If the requested operation translates to more than one micro op, then there
   is a large chance that the ops will be rejected because they are not sorted

Buffers are heavyweight and memory-owning.  In order to pass the key or
value to an object, a new buffer had to be created, and the contents
copied.  This buffer could be passed by reference into the hashing
layer, but the damage of a memory allocation/copy was already done.

This patch uses the new e ""slice"" object which refers to memory in a
lightweight, non-memory-owning manner.  The rest of the app (built on
hsh) can now follow this pattern.

The reason for this change was simple:  For a single key and value,
there were, on average, 14 buffer copies per operation, all of which are
unnecessary.  As this change percolates up the code base, it will
eliminate all of these useless operations.  The result will be reduced
CPU usage (right now, a number of clients can saturate one host's CPU)."

Reasons for this are several-fold.
 - CMake would not recognize changes in system headers.  This lead to a bughunt
   where the solution was to do a clean build.  I'd like to avoid this in the

 - CMake doesn't integrate as smoothly with Fedora.
 - CMake is C/C++ only.  I want auto-builds of Java and Python bindings.
    - This is not just a trivial wish.  It takes many manual steps to build the
      correct packages for YCSB integration.  I'd like to save time in the
      future.
    - SWIG seems better-supported under the Autotools.
 - CMake doesn't seem to support tarball generation.  Autotools has a convenient
   ""dist-check"" which makes sure everything builds in the tarball automatically.
 - Overall, this will save me hours in the coming weeks, and many more over
   months."

Before N network worker threads would wait on a queue for messages to be
pushed.  In busy times this would lead to all threads pulling messages
from the e::lockfree_fifo.  Unfortunately, it takes many clients to put
such a load on the queue.  During less busy times (e.g., not loaded to
capacity), threads wait on a condition variable, and each push to the
queue ends up causing a lock/signal/unlock.  This also tends to have a
thread do a send, push a message (for self delivery), and then wake
another thread.  By the time the pushing thread gets back around to
popping, the other thread has woken, and taken over the message.

Under the new model, all threads enter a loop where they perform a
poll(2) and react to events.  It seems to eliminates almost all latency
associated with the delivery queue.  Furthermore, threads which
self-deliver are likely to pop the same message they push, so costs of
transferring data between cores is significantly reduced.  I measure a
94.22% performance improvement in latency.  My only concern is whether
poll will actually multiplex between threads."

Up until this point our replication scheme didn't provide
linearizability in the case of point-leader failures.

The specific case we had trouble with was:
1.  The last replica in subspace n-1 sends an update message to the
    point leader.
2.  The point leader sends ACK to client.
3.  The point leader dies and the client message is not lost.  The
    second replica in subspace 0 becomes a point leader, and has no clue
    that the message was acknowledged.
4.  The client sends a get to the new point leader and sees a break from
    our linearizability guarantees.

The fix:  After sending to all replicas in all subspaces, extra PENDING
message[1] is sent in reverse along the entire subspace 0 chain,
starting at the last replica and working toward the point-leader.  The
point leader may commit/ack the client when it receives this message,
and may then send the ACK message as it did before.

The special (e.g., not entity to entity) functions take extra parameters
to determine the entity to which (or from which) a message is sent.  For
example, if we know that we must send an ACK from a region, we can just
send(region, ...) and let the communication layer sort out the proper
entity which fits as the source (or it drops the message).  The three
special functions are:

 - forward in chain A, or to the head of B
 - forward in chain A, or to the tail of B
 - backward in chain A, or to the tail of B

These replace the ad-hoc variations of these, and make it easier to
understand exactly where a message will go (the ability to send to head
or tail of B when sending forward in a chain was prompted by the
upcoming change referred to in the previous commit RE: PENDING)."

this message type indicates that a host must (TODO) mark the message as
such so that if the host becomes point-leader, it can immediately

The 'count' client issues alternating PUT/GET requests for keys.  By the
guarantees of linearizability, we know that the GET should ALWAYS return
the PUT.  This was not the case.  It happened ~1/1000 times with the
default disk-flushing timeouts, and more often with more aggressive
timings.

The problem:  For certain keys, if the key was put to disk, it would be
dropped because the network-exposed regions created disks with the same
prefix/mask.  This is incorrect because network-exposed regions'
coordinates are created solely by the dimensions which form the region's
subspace, while the on-disk regions are formed using all dimensions.
Thus, it was incorrect to use the same region for both.  The solution is
to use a region of (X, Y, 0, 0) instead, as it will capture all elements
from the network region."
