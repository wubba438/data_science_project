The reason this has been so difficult is that the standard clearfix with 0 height doesn't work well in IE8:
	- Opera doesn't do the \0020 content hack. I've reverted back to an empty string because this works fine in IE8.
	- It also has issues with the height: 1px, width: 0 workaround. The clearfix fails unless the width spans the length of the cleared element.
	- Having a width of 100% and a height of 1px creates extra space, which invokes scrollbars if applied to the body element.

So after all is said and done, the width/height values need to be branched for IE and Opera."

This should hopefully fix the issues. Essentially, a problem arises when doing dimension calculations. As I bubble down and apply flexbox values, I'm changing each flexbox width/height, etc.

The end result therefore might be a flexbox layout where an inordinate amount of whitespace exists. This can't simply be fixed by bubbling up the DOM, because the same issue would still remain, only backwards.

The fix is to (unfortunately), rubber-band both down the DOM, and back up. This is expensive, but necessary for flexbox layouts.

So I'm introducing a bubbleUp method, which checks each parent for existence of an element with a FLX_DOM_ID expando. If found, it re-applies its flex properties."
