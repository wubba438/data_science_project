Initial commit of the RingRTC Java interface implementation.

The implementation lives in an external .aar with the package
org.signal.ringrtc.

The package provides two high level objects of interest
=======================================================

org.signal.ringrtc.CallConnection -- represents the session of a call,
very similar to WebRTC's PeerConnection.

org.signal.ringrtc.CallConnectionFactory -- creates CallConnection
objects, very similar to WebRTC's PeerConnectionFactory.

The implementation interfaces with the Android application in a few
places:
==================================================================

src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/ApplicationContext.java -- RingRTC
library initialization at application startup.

src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/service/WebRtcCallService.java -- Call
creation and state machine.

src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/ringrtc -- this package implements
interface classes needed by ringrtc and a CallConnectionWrapper helper
class.

The two interfaces needed so far are:

  ringrtc/Logger.java
  ringrtc/SignalMessageRecipient.java

The logger is self-explanatory, but SignalMessageRecipient is a little
more involved.  SignalMessageRecipient encapsulates the Signal-Android
notion of ""Recipient"" and the mechanism for sending Signal Messages
related to audio/video calling.

The CallConnectionWrapper class is clone of the original
org.thoughtcrime.securesms.webrtc.PeerConnectionWrapper, suitably
modified to match the CallConnection interface.

This class continues to handle the Camera switching APIs, with that
portion of the code remaining unmodified from the original.

CallConnectionFactory Details
=============================

The primary public methods:

initialize() -- initialize the WebRTC library and RingRTC library.
The WebRTC initialization is lifted from the original Signal-Android
code.

createCallConnectionFactory() -- creates a CallConnectionFactory
object.  Internally it creates a WebRTC PeerConnectionFactory object
and a RingRTC CallConnectionFactory object.

dispose() -- tears down the CallConnectionFactory object, including
the internal PeerConnectionFactory and RingRTC CallConnectionFactory.

createCallConnection() -- creates a CallConnection object, connecting
that with an application controlled CallConnection.Observer object.

This function takes a CallConnection.Configuration object to link the
CallConnection object with some application provided services, like
sending Signal protocol messages.

CallConnection Details
======================

This object is a subclass of WebRTC's PeerConnection class.

The primary public methods and objects:

CallConnection.Configuration
----------------------------

Configuration object used to parameterize a call.  Notable members:

- SignalServiceMessageSender messageSender
- long callId
- org.signal.SignalMessageRecipient recipient

The 'accountManager' is used to fetch public information from the Signal
service, specifically used here to obtain the public Signal TURN
server details.

The 'callId' is a 64-bit pseudo-random number generated when the call
is initiated, used to identify the call through out its lifetime.

The ""recipient' is an implementation of the
org.signal.SignalMessageRecipient interface, which encapsulates the
sending of Signal service messages to a recipient (remote peer) using
existing Signal protocol data structures.

The native library needs to be able to send Signal messages via the
service, but it does not have a native implementation to do so.
Instead the native code calls out to the client for sending Signal
messages.  To accomplish this, the client implements the
org.signal.SignalMessageRecipient interface and passes an instance of
that in a CallConnection.Configuration object.

CallConnection
--------------

dispose() -- tears down the CallConnection object, including the
internal PeerConnection and RingRTC CallConnection.

sendOffer() -- initiates a call to a remote recipient.  This is the
beginning of an outbound call.

validateResponse() -- checks an offer response recipient against the
originating call details.

handleOfferAnswer() -- handles the receipt of answer, which was a
response from an originating offer.

acceptOffer() -- accept an offer from a remote participant.  This is
the begin of an incoming call.

answerCall() -- invoked when the call is completely established and
online.

hangUp() -- hang up the connection and shut things done.  This is the
end of the call.

sendBusy() -- send the remote side an indication that the local side
is already in a call and the line is busy.

sendVideoStatus() -- send the current state of the local camera video
stream to the remote side.

CallConnection.Observer
-----------------------

Observer object, used by the RingRTC library to notify the client
application of important events and status changes.  Similar in spirit
to WebRTC's PeerConnection.Observer.

Observer callbacks come in three flavors:

- state change notifications,
- on stream notifications
- errors conditions

For state notifications, the callback contains the callId, the
recipient and a CallConnection.CallEvent type.

For streams, the callback contains the callId, the
recipient and a org.webrtc.MediaStream.

For errors, the callback contains the callId, the recipient and an
exception type.  The currently thrown exceptions include:

- UntrustedIdentityException
- UnregisteredUserException
- IOException

Updates to support ringrtc-android version 0.1.0.

* simplify logging interface

It is no longer necessary for the application to specify a Log object
as the library can log via the NDK directly.

* improve error handling and notification

In a number of places where ringrtc errors could occur, no
notification was ever sent to the user, nor was the UI cleaned up.  It
would look like the app was in hung state.

This patch updates these situations to send the WebRtcViewModel a
NETWORK_FAILURE message.

* update handleIncomingCall() for lockManager and notification

During the conversion to RingRTC, the implementation of
handleIncomingCall() missed a couple of things:

-- updating the Phone state with the lockManager
-- sending a message to the viewModel

* log the callId in various handler methods

For debugging purposes it is very handy to have the callId present in
the log during the various call handler methods.

The crash happened because #getNextClosestEvent was called when
mmsDatabase was null, which would normally be impossible. However, it
seems implied that somehow #getNextClosestEvent was being called in the
parent constructor before the child class was fully initialized. That
would imply that the looper was called synchronously in some freak
scenario, but it's the only explanation. So I added a delay to the call
in the parent constructor.

The recent switch to Python3 (2ccdf0e396e82dd) introduced a regression
that led to file content no longer being compared:

   In compareEntries(), two generators/iterators are created:

     sourceInfoList      = filter(lambda sourceInfo: …, sourceZip.infolist())
     destinationInfoList = filter(lambda destinationInfo: …, destinationZip.infolist())

   Few lines later, those are exhausted:

     if len(sourceInfoList) != len(destinationInfoList):

   Yet another few lines later, the exhausted generator is used again:

     for sourceEntryInfo in sourceInfoList:
        …          # <-- unreachable

This is caused by behavioral differences between Python2 and Python3:

We aren't closing Statement objects before the finalizer on those
objects runs. When the GC runs, we'll get warnings like the above
which alert us to the fact that these objects are being automatically
closed for us in the finalizer, but that this is suboptimal behavior.

If we leave too many Statement (or Cursor) objects to be closed in
their finalizers, when the GC runs, it'll take longer than 10 seconds
to close them all and Android will kill the app. This 10 second limit
is hardcoded and we can only try to avoid it. A crash will look like:

I was able to replicate the above crash consistently on a
Samsung Galaxy S7 edge when importing well over 100k SMS messages.
But as soon as I attached a debugger the crash did not persist. I
assume this is because of some VM-level interactions between the two
and did not investigate further after fixing it.

I do not have access to the stack trace for issue #7953 but this
could potentially resolve it. The crash is identical to that in #7477
but this patch is for SMS migration not restoring from a backup. I
was not able to replicate the crash on restoring a >100k message
backup."

There's a chance that the AsyncTask that retrieves a quoted message's
position could finish after the fragment is detached, which would cause
a crash. I've changed it so if this case occurs, the result is ignored.

Also, I noticed that when searching the message table, if a quote can't
be found, we'd end up traversing the entire table. To prevent this from
taking forever on large message tables, I've limited it to searchin only
what is currently present in the adapter.

In a number of locations in the code, there were conversions of message
expiration times from seconds to milliseconds, and then assigned to `long`
contexts. However these conversions were being done as integer multiplication
rather than long multiplication, meaning that there was a potential for
overflows.

Specifically, the maximum value that could be represented before overflowing
was (2^31 / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24) days = 24.8 days (< 1 month). Luckily the
current allowed timeouts are all less than that value, but this fix would
remove the artificial restriction, effectively allowing values of 1000x greater
(68 years), at least for android.

1) Remove all our PDU code and switch to the PDU code from the

2) Switch to using the system Lollipop MMS library by default,

3) Format SMIL differently, using code from klinker instead of
   what we've pieced together.

4) Pull per-carrier MMS media constraints from the XML config
   files in the klinker library, instead of hardcoding it at 280kb.

Hopefully this is an improvement, but given that MMS is involved,
it will probably make things worse instead."

getActiveNotifications() seems to throw an NPE on some Motorola
ROMs, all of which appear to be 6.0.1.  This change just swallows
the exception.

6.0 doesn't support bundled notifications, so I think it's alright
if they don't get canceled, since the summary notification will
still be displayed correctly.

This would only affect users who have an android wear device
attached to one of these buggy ROMs. By swallowing this exception,
they would not always get notifictions dismissed on their wear
 device.

   our own with new hardware. Not worth it.

4) Selfies first.

1) The group ID for jobs that process received messages was
   previously set to the sender's e164.  This guaranteed
   serialization of messages per-recipient, while allowing
   processing of multiple recipients in parallel.  Unfortunately
   in the case of groups, this results in out of order
   conversations, since the ""sender"" for each message is
   different.  And we can't determine that it was a group
   message until *after* we process it.  So this change just
   puts all message processing from all senders in one big queue.

2) Synchronization messages were always being displayed before
   received messages, due to the ""received time"" for those
   being set to the time they were sent.

Drawables are (strangely) mutable objects.  We reuse a single
drawable for each recipient, but some avatar views (the
conversation list -- 40dp) are larger than others (the
conversation -- 30dp).

This results in a situation where TextDrawable doesn't render
itself appropriately, because the bounds are modified by a larger
view.

Giving the Drawable an intrinsic width and height resolves this
conflict.

In the switch from v3, we bind identities in the message MAC
instead of doing the 1mod8 trick.  Since identity keys were
never set as 1mod8, it seemed like we could just remove it.

However, PreKeys are durable.  If an old client upgrades to v3,
it has a bunch of keys that *were* set to 1mod8 floating around.
The Curve25519 donna code re-sets the private key bits on every
operation, which results in a different key, and breaks the output
of an agreement.

So now we don't intentionally generate keys with 1mod8, but we
have to remove the donna code to honor existing 1mod8 keys for
the rest of time.  Trevor is squarely to blame.

1) Modify SessionRecord to store a list of ""previous"" sessions
   in addition to the current active session.  Previous sessions
   can be used for receiving messages, but not for sending
   messages.

2) When a possible ""simultaneous initiate"" is detected, push the
   current session onto the ""previous session"" stack instead of
   clearing it and starting over.

3) Additionally, mark the new session created on a received
   possible ""simultaneous initiate"" as stale for sending.  The
   next outgoing message would trigger a full prekey refresh.

4) Work to do: outgoing messages on the SMS transport should
   probably not use the existing session if it's marked stale
   for sending.  These messages need to fail and notify the user,
   similar to how we'll handle SMS fallback to push users before
   a prekey session is created."

1) We now delay MMS notifications until a payload is received,
   or there's an error downloading the payload.  This makes
   group messages more consistent.

2) All ""text"" parts of an MMS are combined into a second text
   record, which is stored in the MMS row directly rather than
   as a distinct part.  This allows for immediate text loading,
   which means there's no chance a ConversationItem will resize.

   To do this, we need to include MMS in the big DB migration
   that's already staged for this application update.  It's also
   an ""application-level"" migration, because we need the MasterSecret
   to do it.

3) On conversation display, all image-based parts now have their
   thumbnails loaded asynchronously.  This allows for smooth-scrolling.
   The thumbnails are also scaled more accurately."

1) We now try to hand out cursors at a minimum.  There has always been
   a fairly clean insertion layer that handles encrypting message bodies,
   but the process of decrypting message bodies has always been less than
   ideal.  Here we introduce a ""Reader"" interface that will decrypt message
   bodies when appropriate and return objects that encapsulate record state.

   No more MessageDisplayHelper.  The MmsSmsDatabase interface is also more
   sane.

2) We finally rid ourselves of the technical debt associated with TextSecure's
   initial usage of the default SMS DB.  In that world, we weren't able to use
   anything other than the default ""Inbox, Outbox, Sent"" types to describe a
   message, and had to overload the message content itself with a set of
   local ""prefixes"" to describe what it was (encrypted, asymetric encrypted,
   remote encrypted, a key exchange, procssed key exchange), and so on.

   This includes a major schema update that transforms the ""type"" field into
   a bitmask that describes everything that used to be encoded in a prefix,
   and prefixes have been completely eliminated from the system.

   No more Prefix.java

3) Refactoring of the MultipartMessageHandler code.  It's less of a mess, and
   hopefully more clear as to what's going on.

The next step is to remove what we can from SmsTransportDetails and genericize
that interface for a GCM equivalent."
