* Add `RecordOf<TProps>` type alias for TypeScript

The `Record.Factory` API is great but the current definitions lack a simple way to reference instances of a record (created from a record factory). This adds a `RecordOf<TProps>` which can be used to create interfaces containing records:

```ts
import { Record, RecordOf } from ""immutable"";

interface Foo {
    flag: boolean;
    message: string;
}

const FooRecord = Record<Foo>({
    flag: false,
    message: ""DEFAULT""
});

interface Bar {
    foo: RecordOf<Foo>;
}

const bar: Bar = {
    foo: new FooRecord({ flag: true })
}
```

Currently I've been creating this type in every library so that I can refer to instances and I think Flow has support for something similar.

* Made the record instance `ReadOnly`

* Fixed typo in `Readonly` and ran prettier"

    Use prettier for tests

    When working on projects that use prettier, I enable the format-on-save
    option in my editor of choice which run prettier whenever I save a file.

    This always updated the formatting of the tests files when working on
    Immutable.js, since those files were not formatted using prettier yet.
    Prettier added [typescript support][1] in the mean time, so I thought
    it was a good idea to keep the whole code base consistent and to allow
    everyone to use format-on-save without getting annoyed.

    Since there are not a lot of PRs open, I think it's a good time to merge
    this.

* RFC: functional API with support for Array and Object

This adds a functional API for the core read/write methods (get, set, update, merge) (originally proposed in #39). I don't believe that simply providing a functional alternative is enough value to warrant the increase in API surface area, but what this functional API enables is to use the immutable read/write API on typical Array and Object values, allowing for a combination of nesting Immutable Collections and typical Arrays and Objects while preserving the ability to use `getIn` and `setIn`.

As an example:

```js
import { getIn, setIn } from 'immutable';
const data = { x: { y: 'z' } }
const z = getIn(data, ['x', 'y'])
const data2 = setIn(data, ['x', 'y'], 'abc') // { x: { y: 'abc' } }
```

I think that providing this flexibility will allow for a more reasoned use of Immutable collections based on best fit, rather than the ""all or nothing"" approach often taken. Specifically, I'm interested in supporting typical Objects as a viable alternative to Record for those that want to use Immutable collections but prefer not to use the Record API.

This factors toJS() into its own function and simplifies the implementation to recurse within only toJS() instead of between toJS() and value.toJS().

The methods `merge()` and `mergeDeep()` were the last places internally to call `fromJS()`, a method that is expensive, and limits the ability to use plain object and array values within immutable collections.

This PR removes fromJS, not doing any deep coercion at all for `merge()` and simply passing object (incl array) values into the `merge()` function recursively for `mergeDeep()` operations, so only coercing those values that expect to be - leaving others alone.

This is breaking because calls to `merge()` previously were implicitly `fromJS()`'d to get deeply immutable collections, however that is no longer the case.

To update code which relied on this behavior, convert `collection.merge(x)` to `collection.merge(fromJS(x))`.

This PR fixes a bug with the slice operator that caused non value
iterators of an unknown sized sequence to continue although the source
sequence was exhausted, eventually accessing the value of a key/value
pair that does not exist.

The issue did not happen with fixed sized sequences since we can
calculate resulting size in advance (as `sliceSize`) and bail out early.
For an unknown sized sequence however, we can not know this size in
advance (see this comment: [1]).

To solve this, we now bail out when we encounter a completed iterator
before proceeding to process it further.

    Change Set key type back to never

    1. Set<T> once again extends Collection<never, T>.
    2. pages/lib/TypeKind.js understands Never now.
    3. Remove calls to Set.has and Set.get. These refer to the key type,
    which is now `never`. Set.contains should be used instead of Set.has.
    `if (Set.contains(x)) Set.get(x)` should be replaced with
    `if (Set.contains(x)) x` since Sets shouldn't change the identity of
    their items.

    Set.has shouldn't be used; it refers to the key type of the collection
    and the key type of Set is always number. Compare indexed types like
    List, where this is also true.

    Work around TS2.4:Collection.toSeq now returns any

    This works around the out-of-memory crash in Typescript 2.4 that arises
    from the compiler doing too much work when checking the correctness of
    `extends` relationships. The Typescript compiler got caught in a deep
    recursion when checking `toSeq: Seq<K, V>`, the previous type.

Date:   Wed Aug 9 09:35:16 2017 -0700

    Set types:K type parameter is now never

    The previous type, Set<T> extends Collection<T, T>, results in an
    incorrect type for `map` because `map` is not allowed to change the key
    type, only the value type. But map's previous return type of Set<T>
    asserted that both the key *and* the value type changed. Now the key
    type is always `never`.

    Loosen type of Keyed.flatMap and descendants

    `Keyed.flatMap` says that `mapper` is allowed to change the key type and the
    value type, but `Collection.keyMap` says that `mapper` is only allowed to
    change the value type. This commit resolves the typing problem by making
    the return type's type arguments both `any`. It does not resolve the
    mismatch in the implementation of Map.flatMap, for example."

* RFC: Refactor Record. No longer a Collection. Faster guts.

This is a breaking change refactor of Record which no longer extends a collection type and therefore does not inherit sequence methods - which was a constant source of confusion and breakage. It also refactors the internals to no longer rely on a Map, but instead a fixed size List which should result in dramatically faster performance. This is also a breaking change as `delete()` (aka `remove()`) and `clear()` are no longer available - previously these methods reverted values to their default value, now that can be done with `set(k, undefined)`.

This adds a predicate function `isRecord()` and also minorly refactors related functionality such as `Seq()` constructors.

This PR does a few things:

* Deprecates `Immutable.Iterable.isXXX` and moves all methods to `Immutable.isXXX` for easier access.
* Adds a new predicate `isImmutable()` which is very similar to `isIterable` but also checks for Immutable.js collections that are transiently mutable. Because of the naming, I expct more people to use this method as it's far less confusing.
* Adds a new predicate `isValueObject()` which tests for `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods. This provides greater visibility for custom value types and ensures that user-code which checks for it won't forget hashCode.
* BREAKING: `Immutable.is()` now relies directly on `isValueObject()` which means previous values which define `equals()` but *do not define* `hashCode()` will no longer be considered equal since they do not qualify as value object types. This will improve confusion and bugs around why Set/Map keys behave unexpectedly for semi-value-object types."

This makes a few important changes:

* Existing errors for bad key paths have been improved to explain why and where the issue is.
* Previously strings were converted into an array of characters key path, a constant source of confusion. After this PR providing strings will throw an error.
* Previously anything iterable was allowed, but now only Arrays and Ordered Iterables, otherwise an error is thrown. This avoids a rare pitfall where Sets are used as a path, which have undefined iteration order.
* Adds a new thrown error for getIn()/hasIn() if a key path encounters a value which cannot be read with get(). Previously notSetValue was returned.

This refactor changes how indexed iterable indices are created when reversed. Rather than always incrementing up from 0, `__iterate(, true)` now maintains original indicies. This makes `ToKeyedSequence` much simpler, and `reverseFactory` a bit more complicated. On balance this seems net-simpler and bonus it's net-more-correct. All existing test cases continue to pass and new test cases added failed before and pass now.

The flow type definition tests added in #878 relied on declaring a module, which required .flowconfig to explicitly include the flow definition files, and made exports unclear. This reverts some of the structural changes to the immutable.js.flow from that PR and simplifies the .flowconfig test file to ensure tests are against the *local* copy of immutable. This uncovered a few issues with tests including a mistaken sense that types were exportes as classes and that Set intersections were causing issues.

Would love to do this:

Thoughts? Pardon if this has been discussed before and I just missed it. Thanks!"

Unfortunately extending Set and Map caused issues with OrderedSet
and OrderedMap flow annotations. For example,

```
const orderedSet: OrderedSet<number> = OrderedSet.of(1,2,3);
```

was not valid, because `of` was incorrectly assumed to return a
`Set<number>` rather than an `OrderedSet<number>`.

The fix was to copy and paste the Set and Map flow annotations,
adjusting for OrderedSet and OrderedMap as appropriate.

See #1015 for more details."

Fixes #579

ES6 introduces both 'symbol' as the possible result of a `typeof` expression, as well as makes room for the possibility of future different values from non-standard exotics or presumably from ES7 proposed additions.

http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-typeof-operator

This amends the `hash` function to only perform hashJSObj if the value is in fact a typeof 'object'. Otherwise as a fallback, we rely on the existence of a 'toString' function, and the value is hashed as if it were a string using the return of toString. If toString has not been defined, then an error is raised."

When calling cursor.cursor(), the subCursor fn calls makeCursor and its logic expects arguments.length less than 4 to trigger making subCursor.

Unfortunately subCursor calls it with 4 arguments, so we can correct this so that it will call with 3 or 4 depending on how it was called.

This is an alternate fix to @jcranendonk's since the other fix checked if value was void 0 (undefined), however it might be valid to pass undefined to these functions, so the argument.length check is probably safer."

This is a pretty huge diff, and deserves some explanation.

 * Replaces the smash-specific ""import"" declarations and the jslint @globals and @exports docblocks with ES6-module-style ""import"" and ""export"" declarations.

 * Excludes `smash` from the dev dependencies, includes `esperanto` - a bundler similar to `smash` but which operates on ES6-modules.

 * Broke the implicit circular dependencies by moving most of Iterable's implementation to IterableImpl.js, responsible for building the prototype of Iterable.

 * There were a few other implicit circular dependencies solved by moving shared utility functions into their own modules.

This is also the first step in this direction. While the bundle builds and all tests pass, this has introduced awkwardness and a few (negligable) additional bytes to the bundle. There is also ample opportunity for further refactoring of the larger modules to better organize and make circular dependencies more clear.

getIn and updateIn have been re-written in terms of iteration, allowing them to accept not only arrays as key paths, but any iterable source, including List.

It also makes a subtle change to the behavior of updateIn with respect to the `notSetValue`. Previously, the identity function for updateIn could result in a
modification if `notSetValue` was provided. This made the value `undefined` special which can be ambiguous if `undefined` is intended as a proper value. These
two behaviors are undesired, so the new behavior is to compare the return of the `updater` function to the provided argument. This means identity function
will **always** result in no change, and `undefined` is only as special as any other value."

An optimization employed by Clojure, when a Map is very small (<= 8 entries), it is cheaper (memory and time) to treat it as a flat list of entries instead of a HAMT. ArrayMap does not use hashing, and so hash() is never called for update/get on these small maps. When a Map grows beyond the capacity of ArrayMap, it is automatically converted into a HAMT.

Inspired by JSC's implementation of Map, this adds a condition to OrderedMap#remove to replace and pack the backing store.

This makes the Seq constructors (and by proxy, the Collection constructors) stricter. List and Set no longer accept Objects with discarded keys, as that is of dubious value and more often could represent a bug or programmer error. When a KeyedSeq is provided to List and Set, it should behave as an iterable and provide [K,V] tuples rather than discarding keys. This makes between-version operation smoother and makes Immutable's Iterator behave more similarly to generic Iterators.

The toXXX() methods have preserved their behavior.

The behavior of ""array-like"" values is stricter as well. Only Indexed (List) and Set iterables will consume any array-like as an array (such as `arguments` or String). Keyed iterables will always favor Object keys, which removes a pitfall where trying to construct a Map where ""length"" is a key would fail.

Finally, this improves `concat` to follow these rules based on the parent iterable type. Previously concatting an object to a List would cause the keys of the object to be treated as a list, which in the context of `concat`'s API of `concat(...valueOrArrays)` made concatting a single value dangerous affair. `concat` now expressly accepts `Iterables`, `Array` or singleton ""value"", and will not attempt to coerce any value other than Array into an Iterable."

Fixes #168

mergeDeep attempts to recursively call mergeDeep on child collections, so:

```
var m1 = Map({ a: Map({ b: 1 }) });
m1.mergeDeep({ a: null });
```

Was equivalent to:

```
var m1 = Map({ a: Map({ b: 1 }) });
m1.update('a', m => m.mergeDeep(null));
```

Which resulted in a no-op at best, and bad behavior at worst as `m.mergeDeep(null)` is unintended.

After this diff, `mergeDeep` first checks to see if the merging in value is lax-iterable-like, and only if it is a value validly passed to `mergeDeep` will that actually occur, otherwise the non-iterable value will replace the existing value (or be passed to the merging function)."

This is a pretty serious API change: Collections and Sequences now have a common construction API which is a much closer mirror of Array and Map/Set ES6 construction methods.

All Sequence subclasses now have `Class()` `Class.from()` and for Indexed or Set Sequences, `Class.of()`.

This results in a few things:

* construction (in `from` or class constructor) now behaves equivalently for Sequences and Iterables.
* `Class(a,b,c)` is now `Class.of(a,b,c)`
* Subclasses no longer need to implement `from` or `of`, simply the constructor.

To ease the transition (i.e. to fail loudly), error message clarity has been added to `fromEntrySeq`"

`seq.flatten()` has changed in a couple ways:

 * Now accepts an optional `depth` argument to describe how deep it should flatten. By default it will flatten infinitely deeply. This is different from the previous behavior of always flattening shallowly. As a convenience, it also accepts boolean ""shallow"" (e.g., it converts booleans to numbers).

 * Now *only* flattens Sequence instances and not sequenceable values (which would include Array, string, anything with @@iterator). This is different from previous behavior of flattening anything that could be converted to sequence and not only instances of Sequence.

 * flatMap() and concat() behavior of have not changed, and still allow mapping to and concatting sequenceable values and not only Sequence instances. (Read: no changes here)."

This diff does a handful of things that add up to the title. First, it adds ""altered"" as a property of mutable Vector and Map. When these structures are mutably updated, the flag is set to true. We then use this to determine if we can safely return self from withMutations. Next, it reverts most of 3e1e874 and 536a27c which did this manually.

It also simplifies the implementation of OrderedMap and Set which are implemented using Map and Vector, as a side-effect fixing an issue where falsey keys would fail to set in OrderedMap."

Fixes #31.

Previously, grouping a keyed sequence would return each group as an IndexedSequence with nonnumeric keys, which was wrong. This was caused by fromEntries returning an IndexedSequence instead of a keyed sequence. With this, fromEntries always returns a keyed sequence (which matches the type definition) and Sequence's groupBy returns the correct type. (Calling groupBy on an IndexedSequence still gives each group as an IndexedSequence, as before.)
