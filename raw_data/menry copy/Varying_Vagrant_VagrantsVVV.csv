This attempts to optimise site provisioning by doing several things:

 - Adds the `{vvv_tls_cert}` and `{vvv_tls_key}` so that site provisioners don't have to always copy paste the same chunk of code in their provisioners
 - Optimise the `vvv-hosts` part so that it doesn't look for them if their are hosts in the config, and so that it then checks common places first
 - Massively bumps up the number of warnings and error messages that could be shown for cases when things go wrong that weren't handled previously
 - Moves hosts file parsing into its own function
 - Simplified skip provision by returning early so that half the file can be moved over 1 indent for easier reading"

Remove attempt to enforce ipv4 in postfix"

In #420, we added a line to provisioning that attempts to set
""ipv4"" as the only allowed protocol for postfix due to issues in
how network connections managed the ipv6 connection.

Because the config file does not yet exist during initial
provisioning, that caused an error message saying as much. See #628.

It turns out that this line hasn't been doing anything. :)

I first went down the path of using `debconf-set-selections` to
set the protocol value. This works, but then disables ipv6 entirely
as a valid protocol. Since we haven't heard of any other issues
besides the original in #420, I think it's safe to not make any
change here and then watch for any problems.

I have a feeling that postfix has gotten better about this. In the
documentation for the `inet_protocols` config, it's mentioned that
""versions before 2.8 attempt to connect via IPv6 before attempting
to use IPv4.""

http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#inet_protocols

Now that we're past 2.8, it's entirely possible that the protocol
detection has gotten better. If we do run into an issue, there is
a newer `smtp_address_preference` config that allows us to specify
which protocol should be attempted first.

http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_address_preference

In that case, we may need to create our own custom config file as
it's not entirely obvious that `debconf-set-selections` will work
for this value.

See #420.
Fixes #628."

The command we use to check if a package is installed, `dpkg -s`,

By shifting to the original package name, provisioning should
be a bit quieter when reused."

Previously, VVV was cloning the wp-cli repo and installing
composer dependencies. This switches to the standard wp-cli
installation method which will make updating wp-cli easier.

For existing users, the symlink for the wp-cli repo is
removed but the repo remains at /srv/www/wp-cli.

Reprovisioning will update to the latest nightly.

Users can run `wp cli update` at any time
or `wp cli update --nightly` to update to the latest nightly.

* Switch to NodeSource for NodeJS packages

Some of the WP node modules and their dependencies are beginning to complain about our outdated versions of NodeJS and npm. NodeSource seems to be the new standard for up-to-date NodeJS packages.

I've taken the conservative approach and chosen NodeJS v0.12.

Note, if someone runs `apt-get update` after a `vagrant provision` without first running `vagrant destroy`, apt-get will complain about not having the appropriate key for the nodesource packages. I'm not sure what the appropriate way to handle this. It may just be adding a something to the release notes saying to run `wget -qO- https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource.gpg.key | apt-key add -` if one experiences this issue.

* Add NodeSource key before package install

`nodejs` is a package we install by default. Adding the NodeSource key early (if is doesn't exist), outside of the `apt_package_install_list` check, ensures that `apt-get udpate` won't complain. It also means that users won't have to run any other commands to get the latest NodeJS outside of the `apt-get` commands.

* Switch from NodeJS 0.12.x to NodeJS 4.x LTS"

The installation of local npm packages was running into trouble
due to what is likely a race condition caused by slow shared drives
between the host and guest machines. This is mostly a guess, but
seems plausible.

We can instead handle the initial SVN checkout, the npm package
installation, and the initial build via grunt in the VM's `/tmp`
machine. Once this is all prepped, it is then moved to the final
location in `/srv/www/wordpress-develop` before other scripts that
install WordPress run.

Anything involving files runs quite a bit quicker during the initial
setup. The move of the directory takes a long while though, which
kind of negates the original speed. :)

But speed isn't the problem, incomplete local npm packages is.

jeremyfelt,2015-07-03 01:13:26,https://api.github.com/repos/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/git/commits/48f3dcf6f6b1ff8f05ada7a9450db4820126a256,48f3dcf6f6b1ff8f05ada7a9450db4820126a256,"Revert ""Fix phpMyAdmin permission issue on VMWare""

We now provide a custom config file for phpMyAdmin and should
use that as a way to override settings such as this for other
providers. This is specifically a concern due to possible
security issues on public networks.

This reverts commit b18ca1347453da386733192930497b2c6f286218."

When adding databases to the engine, MySQL adds them all to
the _same_ file by default (in < 5.6.6). When removing these databases
later, MySQL fails to truncate the file, leading to used disk space that's
not actually being used. By specifying one file per table, end users can
more easily free disk space when projects are archived/removed.

Also note, this is a feature that is on by default in MySQL >= 5.6.6, so
we might as well bake it in now to get the management benefits and get
everyone ready for an eventual version update."

Relying on ping to detect network connectivity was troublesome as
some networks block icmp and would generate a false error. As we
need HTTP access throughout provisioning anyway, we can rely on
it as an indicator of network health.

This ends up being quite a bit faster too. We could probably get
even better with just a DNS request, but that may hide another
issue depending on the network.

I've seen this for a few versions of VVV that in both Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 the below line of code would always evaluate to false, and as such, always install Composer instead of checking for an update:
```bash
if [[ -n ""$(composer --version | grep -q 'Composer version')"" ]]; then

I propose using the following, which seems to evaluate more consistently:
```bash

Rather than attempting to handle DNS lookups itself, this causes
the virtual machine to proxy any DNS back through the host machine.

This should really help in cases where your DNS changes due to an
unfamiliar network, etc... We'll want to pay attention to how it
handles local host lookups, though I think the hosts file will
still be watched.

databases. If an existing VM is already storing database data on
the guest machine, drives will continue to mount. If you remove
this data or start fresh with VVV, the MySQL directory will not
be stored on your computer.

(to me) makes more sense at all.

making it easy to backup data on a regular basis as required."

The reasoning here - https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx/issues/28 - seems to make sense. When we set `tcp_nodelay` to off, we tell Nginx to use Nagle's algorithm to figure out how packets should be buffered with a possible 500ms latency if it can't figure things out in time. This 500ms latency is something that even Nagle says (http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=174457&threshold=1&commentsort=0&mode=thread&cid=14515105) should stay in the 1980s.

Suggesting we remove this directive and leave it to Nginx's default `on` to *not* use Nagle's algorithm."

In v1.0 of VVV, we made the change to copy a bunch of config files over rather than using symlinks. Because of this we had to unlink all of the previous symlinks before the copies would actually work. The unlinking should be treated as a temporary solution as it is somewhat confusing to run across in the provisioning script.

This commit removes unlinking. If for some reason an upgrade is done from v0.9 directrly to v1.1 or master, it is possible that some errors will appear explaining that a file cannot be copied on top of itself. This isn't much of a big deal, but should be treated with a `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up` to clear things a bit."

Lots of defaults were set in the my.cnf file and as mysql versions increase, the syntax for the settings changes.  As we're  not purposely setting these values to anything particular, I've just deleted them in the my.cnf, which will use whatever default the current version of MySQL has.  I've left a few variables set in here that are relevant, such as max_allowed_packet.  I decided to remove things rather than comment them out because if you need that setting in this file, you know what you are doing enough to know where to put it without having a guide.  Having the values in there does more of a disservice I believe as it provides suggestions that have no relation to what you are trying to accomplish.  The items that are commented out and left in are things that could be toggled on and off to aide development.

The Webgrind repository provides a full config.php file rather than a sample that is not immediately used. For this reason, whenever we symlink or copy our custom config.php file over that one in our git clone of the repo, git thinks that we have locally modified changes and a small notice pops out during provisioning. See #118

Separately... Virtualbox, at least on some OSes doesn't do symlinking between two shared folders inside the VM. This is currently causing issues in Windows, and quite possibly could appear in other places as well. See #120 and https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10085

Back to the first issue, it's entirely possible that an updated config.php file from the repository could overwrite our modifications **OR** that we could all of a sudden have incompatible modifications. Mostly for this reason, but also to clean up the others, and because the only change we were making to config.php was the timezone, I'm removing the custom file in favor of the repository default.

Because WordPress cannot correctly identify whether rewrite
capabilities are enabled on this server setup, ""index.php"" is getting
injected into the top level of the permalink structure (e.g.
http://www.mysite.com/index.php/sample-post/). Hooking into WP's
`got_rewrite` filter to explicitly specify that rewrites are available
removes the issue, as explained in the closing comments for the
core Trac ticket 13201 and demonstrated in the code for rtCamp's
""Nginx Helper"" plugin.

In the interest of clarify, this plugin uses the simplest possible
code (i.e., no plugin Class boilerplate).

Provisioning runs again on `vagrant up` after `vagrant halt`, on `vagrant reload`, and on `vagrant provision`. In these cases, we should not need to run `apt-get update` again, as all packages installed by apt will persist through shutdown and boot.

This creates a file in the guest OS's tmp directory that persists until the vagrant box is destroyed, at which time the full provisioning script will run again.
