This is a follow up to #4300. The main changes are:

1. The user-specified query string is no longer merged with the redirect query string. The redirecting server is expected to reflect the user-specified query string.
2. The connection's URL and query string are now reset to their initial user-specified values when the connection stops instead of retaining their redirected values.
3. The .NET client's ""Connection.Url"" property no longer matches the redirect value and instead always maintains its initial value.
4. The JS clients ""url"" property does reflect the redirect value until the client stops, because the public url and related properties are used in various internal places. This is the already-existing behavior, and it does seem worthwhile to untangle it to behave like the .NET client.
5. Both the .NET clients ""Connection.QueryString"" property and the JS clients ""qs"" property never match the redirect query string and instead always maintain their initial value."

fixes #4152

This change adds support for a new '/configFile:' option to the 'signalr.exe' tool's 'ghp' command

If your server app uses a later version of an assembly than the 'signalr.exe' tool uses, we need a binding redirect. Newtonsoft.Json is the most common trigger here.

To fix this, you need to apply the binding redirect to the AppDomain that 'signalr.exe' creates to invoke the JavaScriptGenerator. This means you either need to put it in a 'signalr.exe.config' next to 'signalr.exe' (yuck), or we need to provide a different mechanism. This change makes it possible to use the '/configFile:' option to pass in the path to your app's Web.config file, which should already contain the necessary redirects.

Our own build tests this change! I updated the Samples project to JSON.NET 11 and immediately hit this issue. When building the Samples project we use `signalr.exe ghp` to generate hub proxies. With these changes, if the `/configFile` option is **not** specified, the build fails with this error message:

```
5>EXEC : error : Failed to load assembly 'Newtonsoft.Json, Version=6.0.0.0,
Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=30ad4fe6b2a6aeed' referenced by the server. If your
application uses a newer version of this assembly, this error is likely due to a missing
or inaccurate binding redirect. If your server application has a 'Web.config' or
'[AppName].exe.config' file with binding redirects in it, provide the path to that file
with the '/configFile' parameter. If you have already provided a '/configFile' parameter,
make sure the config file it points to has a binding redirect for 'Newtonsoft.Json,
Version=6.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=30ad4fe6b2a6aeed' within it. See
https://aka.ms/about-binding-redirects for more information on binding redirects.
```

I added the above error message to help guide users when they encounter this issue because it is not an obvious fix :).

Once the `/configFile` option is provided (see the Samples csproj for an example) the issue goes away!"
anurse,2018-10-17 18:40:05,https://api.github.com/repos/SignalR/SignalR/git/commits/30fdcac935957e242055f59219470aab757bef8c,30fdcac935957e242055f59219470aab757bef8c,"fix #4213 by tracking callback identity better (#4249)

fixes #4213

Previously we used the callback as the key in a JavaScript object. ECMAScript objects are required to have 'String' keys, which means the function is stringified and the string representation is used as the key. The problem is that functions can often have the same string representation. For example, if they are wrapped in something like `bind` or `apply`, the representation is `function() { [native code] }`.

This change switches to use an array and a 'guid' assigned by 'on' as the lookup system. That avoids the problems with stringifying functions. This system of assigning a 'guid' is used by jQuery internally for it's own event lists so it seems like the most appropriate way to handle this."

fixes #4207

This adds an ""Error"" field to the negotiate payload that contains an
error message provided by the server. If present, the `.start`/`.Start`
Task/Promise will be faulted with that error. This only works with
clients that support Protocol version 2.0, so it also has to have the
ProtocolVersion 2.0 value. This is designed to prevent older clients
from continuing to attempt to connect when they get the error response.
Since we use a new ProtocolVersion, older clients will fail with the
protocol incompatibility error."

Fixing an issue where user's code would run a continuation of `HubProxy.Invoke` on a SignalR thread because we were using TaskCompletionSource with default settings. If the user's code blocked it would completely block the receive queue and the user will no longer get any notifications even though the client processes them and add to the queue.  The fix is to dispatch the completion of `HubProxy.Invoke` to a different thread (note that we can't use `TaskCreationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously` because some platforms we compile for do not support this)."

When a project targeted both net45 and wpa81 or win8 we did not have a subset that could satisfy this. The store websocket transport can only be used if an app/lib targets wpa81 and/or win8 since it is using WinRT APIs. If the app/lib targets any other platform in addition to wpa81/win8 the store websocket cannot be used and therefore we must not install it.

Since we serialize the invocations of Received callbacks in the .NET client,
there is a real risk of deadlocks resulting from one callback blocking waiting
on another callback to execute.

This commit introduces a TaskQueueMonitor used exclusively by the .NET client
to try to detect callbacks that are running long and notify the user using
Connection.OnError that a callback may be deadlocked.

The amount of time a callback may execute before an error is raised can be
configured using Connection.DeadlockErrorTimeout. The default timeout is
10 seconds.

Now if the disconnect cancellation token is cancelled we will not try to reconnect if the websocket gets closed and if we are already trying to reconnect we will stop doing this.

The `CancelledTaskHandledinLongPollingLoop` test is returning a cancelled task from the poll request and then is checking if the OnError method with the `OperationCancelledException` argument was invoked. It used a wait handle to block the test until the poll request returns. However the `OnError` method is invoked on a different thread and therefore the test may fail due to a race condition if the test starts verification before the `OnError` method is actually called. The fix is to wait with the verification until the `OnError` is called (or fail if it is not called within 2 seconds) to avoid the race."

Because we use the `SafeThreadInvoker` for invoking the `Fail()` method the calls from the transport implementations were no-ops because they would have happened after the call from the `TransportInitializationHandler` which in turn would make `SafeThreadInvoker` ignore any further calls."

If a transport failed during the start request or if the start request failed we would not fail the transport or throw an exception leaving the transport in kind of a zombie state. The reason for this was that we used `SafeThreadInvoker` to start the start request which invalidated any further `Fail` calls. When AutoTransport was being used we would always try the next transport even though the correct behavior was to throw from the `Start` method if the connect request completed successfully and a failure occured during start request. The fix is to not to use SafeThreadInvoker to start the start request. In addition we have to track the state of the initialization phase to prevent failing the transport due to timeout once the connect request completed successfully and to throw the StartException after connect request completed successfully to let the AutoTransport know to not try the next available transport but to re-throw the exception.

For foreverFrame transport SignalR appended the iframe as the last child of the body node. However some libraries (e.g. jQuery UI) move nodes inside the body which causes the iframe to reload which results in sending a ""connect"" request even though the transport has already been started. Because we cleaned up some things after sending the original ""connect"" request the second ""connect"" request may cause ""Object expected"" exceptions. The fix is to move the iframe outside the document body node so it is less likely to be touched/moved by the user's code.

WebSocketHandler class is used on the server and on the client. While on the server we just instantiate this type on the client the WebSocketTransport derives from it. This blocks creating a base class for client transport which would contain a common functionality (e.g. parsing the response). After this change WebSocketTransport no longer derives from the WebSocketHandler but instantiates it and uses it internally."

One of the WebSocketHandler.SendAsync() overloads was made public only to enable testing. Granting InternalsVisibleTo to Moq makes it possible to revert this change.
Similarly one of the WebSocketHandler.ProcessWebSocketRequestAsync was public and had parameter of WebSocket type however there is not an API that would return a bare WebSocket to the user and therefore the API is not usable from the end user's perspective.

(The main motivation for hiding these methods is that they take parameters of types that are not available on all platforms and therefore a lot of effort would be required to make the APIs consistent across platform without any apparent benefit since the methods should not be public in the first place).

Also making WebSocketHandler class abstract since it is not really usable standalone so there is no need for it to be instantiatable."

Addresses issue #1144

Since the SCTS.Cancel uses UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem, old Subscriptions
are often not removed before new ones are added when reconnecting.
Topic.AddSubscription would then block the addition of reconnecting
Subscriptions, since reconnecting Subscriptions have the same Identities as
the yet undeleted old subscriptions.

two Subscriptions with the same Identity from being subscribed to the topic

The reason why this logic is necessary is that the onclose for websocket
is what triggers a reconnect.  However if we forcibly stop a connection
via $.connection.hub.stop() the websockets reconnect gets triggered.
This is expected because we close the socket.  This is also what helps
websockets reconnect on network loss which is why we can't just add the
logic in the onclose handler.

The #511 fix was being caused by LongPolling never
RegisteringForDisconnect.  This was because the invocation was being
called in the DoWriteAsync method iwthin the HttpListenerResponseWrapper
when LongPolling only uses the DoWrite piece.  Moving the invocation to
the DoWrite Segment (aka the catch all for writes) fixed the issue.

The Memory leak resulted from multiple requests being called and each
registering for disconnects.  For instance, if using LongPolling
transport and user sends 100 messages there was be 102 disconnect
callbacks, 100 for the messages and 2 for the 2 connection streams.
This was fixed by re-doing how the cancellation token process was built.
Added CancellationTokenResolver whos responsibility is to manage a 1 to
1 relationship between cancellation tokens and connection id's instead
of a 1 to many."

The #511 fix was being caused by LongPolling never
RegisteringForDisconnect.  This was because the invocation was being
called in the DoWriteAsync method iwthin the HttpListenerResponseWrapper
when LongPolling only uses the DoWrite piece.  Moving the invocation to
the DoWrite Segment (aka the catch all for writes) fixed the issue.

The Memory leak resulted from multiple requests being called and each
registering for disconnects.  For instance, if using LongPolling
transport and user sends 100 messages there was be 102 disconnect
callbacks, 100 for the messages and 2 for the 2 connection streams.
This was fixed by re-doing how the cancellation token process was built.
Added CancellationTokenResolver whos responsibility is to manage a 1 to
1 relationship between cancellation tokens and connection id's instead
of a 1 to many."

This commit fixes an issue when SignalR triest to reconnect after a webserver has returned an error page with client side caching enabled.

In this case, SignalR caches the response of the webserver, which results in many requests per second being fired but each request results with a 304 (not modified status code), without ever accessing the server.

In case of IE7-IE9, this will eventually crash the browser.

It's solved by adding a 'cache:false' in the pollXhr ajax parameters (already present in the negotiate)."

- Made a new abort command so disconnect events aren't fired multiple

  client will send an abort command and the receiving end will only raise
  disconnect for those commands, instead of for the disconnect command.

  The disconnect command signifies an unclean disconnect and therefore
  no other event needs to be raised.

  Remove connections from the list of tracked connections when an abort command
  is received. This prevents the disconnect event to fire again for that
  connection.

ReflectedMethodDescriptorProvider::TryGetMethod Performance Optimization  - Take 2"
drub0y,2012-04-26 19:35:02,https://api.github.com/repos/SignalR/SignalR/git/commits/3948198e1eac7c0e0886b5ede94134da37174678,3948198e1eac7c0e0886b5ede94134da37174678,"ReflectedMethodDescriptorProvider::TryGetMethod Performance Optimization

@KrzysFR was doing some profiling on SignalR and noticed that 5% of the time was being spent in HubDispatcher::OnReceivedAsync. I began to look for low hanging fruit in that execution path and one of the first things I noticed was that the ReflectedMethodDescriptorProvider::TryGetMethod was performing a LINQ query, allocating a List with .ToList() and checking if .Count > 1. If only 1 item was found then that item was being returned with a .First(), otherwise no descriptor would be returned.

Obviously this is a hot code path. The cost of allocating the List, populating it, checking the .Count and then doing a .First() is extreme just avoid the possibility of selecting a duplicate method when you could just select the first method that is found and allow the existence of exact duplicates to be documented as undefined/unsupported behavior. In speaking to @davidfowl he thought this might be an acceptable trade off."

The existing Silverlight Client cannot be used with Silverlight 5 because it uses the System.Threading.Tasks NuGet Package which conflicts with the official implementation of Tasks in Silverlight 5.

The System.Threading.Tasks NuGet package does include a build for Silverlight 5 which uses the official Tasks api, but it also includes a TaskExtensions class containing the Unwrap method, which still conflicts with the official TaskExtensions class. So the System.Threading.Tasks NuGet can't be used with SignalR.Client at present.

Instead, this Check-in includes a stand-in (and very naive) implementation of ConcurrentDictionary which is the only part of the TPL used by SignalR.Client and missing from Silverlight 5."

Invalid POST form value escaping in HttpHelper.cs for LongPollingTransport clients"
niik,2011-12-07 18:41:23,https://api.github.com/repos/SignalR/SignalR/git/commits/a7b4776a608bb2da9fd2938aa51cedfba11111f5,a7b4776a608bb2da9fd2938aa51cedfba11111f5,"Fix POST form value escaping in HttpHelper.cs

When encoding the form data key value pairs for POST request in HttpHelper
the values is currently being encoded using System.Uri.EscapeUriString.

EscapeUriString doesn't encode any of the reserved characters specified in
RFC2396 (http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.html#sec-2.2). This causes
characters such as the '+' sign to be sent over the wire unescaped instead of
being sent as %2B. And if strings contains '=' it will break the request.

This in turn causes ASP.NET to treat it as a space sign instead of a plus. To
reproduce simply send a plus sign in any string in the post data from a
SignalR.Client application.

```cs
hub.Invoke(""Send"", ""foo+bar""); // Will be received server side as ""foo bar""
```

Normally I'd use HttpUtility.UrlEncode for encoding forms but since
SignalR.Client wasn't referencing System.Web I went for EscapeDataString
instead. Note however that EscapeDataString (as well as EscapeUriString)
will throw an UriFormatException for strings larger than 32766 characters.
I don't know if this is an issue but if it is perhaps it should be considered
referencing System.Web or writing a custom escape method."
