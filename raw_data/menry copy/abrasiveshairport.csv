With the current code, we do have the following on a system where IPv6
is completely disabled:

socket(PF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = -1 EAFNOSUPPORT (Address
family not supported by protocol)
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0

""::"", &sin6_addr), sin6_flowinfo=0, sin6_scope_id=0}, 28) = -1
EAFNOSUPPORT (Address family not supported by protocol)

The correct fix is to make a new call to getAddr() to ensure that the
entire struct addrinfo will be correctly filled out again with AF_INET
this time. This patch fixes."

The packet type 0x56, sequence number 0, containing 4 bytes (the first two are the sequence number of the previously requested packet) initiates a resync. Not sure what this packet is supposed to do, but it occurs after heavy requesting resending of packets. Seems to be an out of sync situation, so resyncing is not the worst idea.

When requesting resend of packets a lot, iOS sometimes sends a packet with type 0x56 (Reply to resend request), but with sequence number 0 and length == 4. This short length leads to memory corruption later on when processing the packet: alac_decode() expects at least 16 bytes for AES IV. Therefore the segfault.

This fix ignores packets with length < 16, as seen in another implementation here:
http://fossies.org/dox/mythtv-0.25.1/mythraopconnection_8cpp_source.html#l00555

Please be aware that this just fixes the segfault. The suspicious packet seems to be an information of an out of sync situation, so it may deserve further attention.

functional and is much smaller than dbus and avahi, which makes it useful
for embedded systems. In fact, OpenWrt has not dropped support for the howl
