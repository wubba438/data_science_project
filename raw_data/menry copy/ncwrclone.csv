presume this remote name was a local directory for a very suprising

- when an invalid remote name is used in `rclone config create/update/password`

Before this change, with --vfs-cache-mode minimal,writes if files were
opened they would always be read from the remote, regardless of
whether they were in the cache or not.

This change checks to see if the file is in the cache when opening a
file with --vfs-cache-mode >= minimal and if so then it uses it from
the cache.

This makes --vfs-cache-mode writes in particular much more
efficient. No longer is a file uploaded (with write mode) then
immediately downloaded (with read only mode).

This patch makes rclone keep linux page cache usage under control when
uploading local files to remote backends. When opening a file it issues
FADV_SEQUENTIAL to configure read ahead strategy. While reading
the file it issues FADV_DONTNEED every 128kB to free page cache from
already consumed pages.

core/stats can return two different schemas in 'transferring' field.
One is object with fields the other is just plain string.
This is confusing, unnecessary and makes defining response schema
more difficult. It also returns `lastError` as value which can be
rendered differently depending on source of error.

This change standardizes 'transferring' filed to always return
object but with reduced fields if they are not available.
Former string item is converted to {name:remote_name} object.

'lastError' is forced to be a string as in some cases it can be encoded
as an object."

Before this change rclone was sending a MimeType in the requests for
server side Move and Copy.

The conjecture is that if you attempt to set the MimeType to something
different in a Copy then Google Drive has to do an actual copy of the
file data.  This takes a very long time (since it is large) and fails
after a 90s timeout.

After the change we no longer set the MimeType in Move or Copy and the
copies happen instantly and correctly.

Many thanks to @darthShadow for discovering that this was causing the
problem.

It was discovered after lots of experimentation that the cmd/mount

Travis builders only have 2 vCPUs by default, this happens on the
build server very often.

This workaround increases GOMAXPROCS to make the mount test lockup
less likely.

Before this change rclone attempted to set the ""updated"" field in
uploaded objects to the modification time.

However when this modification time was before 1970, google drive
would return the rather cryptic error:

    googleapi: Error 400: Invalid value for UnsignedLong: -42000, invalid

However API docs: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects#resource
state the ""updated"" field is read only and tests confirm that.  Even
though the field is read only, it looks like Google parses it.

This change therefore removes the attempt to set the ""updated"" field
(which was doing nothing anyway) and fixes the problem uploading pre
1970 files.

See #3196 and https://forum.rclone.org/t/invalid-value-for-unsignedlong-file-missing-date-modified/3466"

Under Linux, rclone attempts to preallocate files for efficiency.

then disables pre-allocate if that doesn't work.

Before this change, rclone would return an error from the listing if
there was an unreadable directory, or if there was a problem stat-ing

completely aborts at that point when there is work it could do.

After this change rclone lists the directories and reports ERRORs for
unreadable directories or problems stat-ing files, but does return an
error from the listing.  It does set the error flag which means the
command will fail (and objects won't be deleted with `rclone sync`).

This brings rclone's behaviour exactly in to line with rsync's
behaviour.  It does as much as possible, but doesn't let the errors
pass silently.

In c5ac96e9e7 we made --files-from only read the objects specified and

This caused problems with Google drive (very very slow) and B2
(excessive API consumption) so it was decided to make the old
behaviour (traversing the directories) the default with --files-from
and use the existing --no-traverse flag (which has exactly the right
semantics) to enable the new non scanning behaviour.

In as many methods as possible we attempt to obey the Retry-After
header where it is provided.

This means that when objects are being requested from OVH cold storage
rclone will sleep the correct amount of time before retrying.

If the sleeps are short it does them immediately, if long then it
returns an ErrorRetryAfter which will cause the outer retry to sleep
before retrying.

The previous behavior of the remotes completion was that only
alphanumeric characters were allowed in a remote name. This limitation
has been lifted somewhat by #2985, which also allowed an underscore.

With the new implementation introduced in this commit, the completion of
the remote name has been simplified: If there is no colon ("":"") in the
current word, then complete remote name. Otherwise, complete the path
inside the specified remote. This allows correct completion of all
remote names that are allowed by the config (including - and _).
Actually it matches much more than that, even remote names that are not
allowed by the config, but in such a case there already would be a wrong
identifier in the configuration file.

With this simpler string comparison, we can get rid of the regular
expression, which makes the completion multiple times faster. For a
sample benchmark, try the following:

     # Old way
     $ time bash -c 'for _ in {1..1000000}; do
         [[ remote:path =~ ^[[:alnum:]]*$ ]]; done'

     real    0m15,637s
     user    0m15,613s
     sys     0m0,024s

     # New way
     $ time bash -c 'for _ in {1..1000000}; do
         [[ remote:path != *:* ]]; done'

Before this change we locked the root directory, recursively fetched
the listing, applied it then unlocked the root directory.

After this change we recursively fetch the listing then apply it with
the root directory locked which shortens the time that the root
directory is locked greatly.

With the original method and the new method the subdirectories are
left unlocked and so potentially could be changed leading to
inconsistencies.  This change makes the potential for inconsistencies
slightly worse by leaving the root directory unlocked at a gain of a
much more responsive system while runing vfs/refresh.

Checkers and transfers now get a "": checkers"" and "": transfers"" label

when the transfer has started instead of this.

There was a bug in the routine which shortened the file names (it
always produces strings 1 too long).  This is now fixed with a test.

The formatting string was wrong with a fixed width of 45 - this is now
replaces with the value of `--stats-file-name-length`.

This also meant that there were unecessary leading spaces in the file
names.  So the default `--stats-file-name-length` was raised to 45
from 40."

When the env_auth option is enabled, the AWS SDK's session constructor
now loads configuration from ~/.aws/config and environment variables,
and credentials per the selected (or default) AWS_PROFILE's settings.

This is accomplished by **NOT** including any Credential provider in the
aws.Config passed to the session constructor: If the Config.Credentials
is non-nil, that will always be used and the user's configuration re
role_arn, credential_source, source_profile, etc... from the shared
config will be completely ignored.

(The conditional creation and configuration of the stscreds Credential
provider is complicated enough that it is not worth re-creating that
logic.)"

The practical effect of this is that optional features, eg `rclone
about` wouldn't work properly when called on a file, and likely this
has been causing low level problems for users of these backends for
ages.

Ideally there would be a test for this, but it turns out that this is
really hard, so instead of that all the backends have been converted
to not copy the Fs and a big warning comment inserted for future
readers.

asks for the team drive ID.

Before this change the rest package would forward all the headers on
an HTTP redirect, including the Authorization: header.  This caused
problems when forwarded to a signed S3 URL (""Only one auth mechanism
allowed"") as well as being a potential security risk.

After we use the go1.8+ mechanism for doing this instead of using our
own which does it correctly removing the Authorization: header when
redirecting to a different host.

This hasn't fixed the behaviour for rclone compiled with go1.7.

After it means nearly all remotes will be able to rename files on

This changes checks to see if the remote can do Move or Copy then
calls `operations.Move` to do the actual move.  This will do a server
side Move or Copy but won't download and re-upload the file.

It also checks to see if the destination exists first which avoids

Before this change on Windows, files copied locally could become
heavily fragmented (300+ fragments for maybe 100 MB), no matter how
much contiguous free space there was (even if it's over 1TiB). This
can needlessly yet severely adversely affect performance on hard
disks.

This changes uses NtSetInformationFile to pre-allocate the space to
avoid this.

It does nothing on other OSes other than Windows."

this change adds the depth parameter to listAll and readMetaDataForPath.
this allows recursive calls of these methods with a different depth
header.

Sharepoint won't list files if the depth header is != 0. If that is the
case, it will just return a error 404 although the file exists.
Since it is not possible to determine if a path should be a file or a
directory, rclone has to make a request with depth = 1 first. On success
we are sure that the path is a directory and the listing will work.
If this request returns error 404, the path either doesn't exist or it
is a file.

To be sure, we can try again with depth set to 0. If it still fails, the
path really doesn't exist, else we found our file."

Before this commit rclone's handling of symlinks and junction points
under Windows was broken.  rclone treated them as files and attempted
to transfer them which gave the error ""The handle is invalid"".

Ultimately the cause of this was 3e43ff7414b73f0d which was a
workaround so files with reparse points (which are a kind of symlink)
would transfer correctly.

The solution implemented is to revert the above commit which will mean
that #614 will break again.  However there is now a work-around (which
will be signaled by rclone) to use the -L flag which wasn't available
when the original commit was made.

Fixes #2336"

Very large directories can have their sizes returned as floating point
numbers, eg `1.0034576985781e+14` from the box API.

Before this change this would fail to parse as an int64.

This change parses the size as a float64 instead which will be
perfectly accurate for sizes up to 2**56 which is about 9 PB.

It is unknown whether box themselves use a float64 as an intermediate
representation in the API or not - it seems likely.

This is a problem when syncing a file which just needed its modtime
set with dropbox which can't set the mod time of a file without
re-uploading it.

Before this change we would delete the file, then the server side move
would fail moving the file to the backup-dir because it no longer
existed.

After this change the destination file is moved to the backup-dir
instead of being deleted and the new file is uploaded.

Fixes #2134"

This removes the old system of part accounting and replaces it with a
system of popping off the accounting reader and wrapping up new ones
as necessary.

This makes it much easier to carry the context down the chain of
wrapped readers and get the limiting as near as possible to the
output.  This makes the accounting more accurate and the bandwidth
limiting smoother.

Previously it was necessary to work around large files failing to
download with `--acd-templink-threshold`.  This change makes that flag
obsolete and all files should download.  Templinks may be useful under
some circumstances though the flag isn't being removed.

It does this by filtering `Authorization:` headers out in the
transport if the authorization is supplied in the URL.  This prevents
the ""Only one auth mechanism allowed; only the X-Amz-Algorithm query
parameter, Signature query string parameter or the Authorization
header should be specified"" error from AWS."

Multiple directories (up to --checkers worth) are scanned at once.

This uses much less memory than the previous scheme - only the amount
of memory needed to hold an entire directory listing of objects.

For directory based remotes the speed is unchanged.

For bucket based remotes, instead of doing one API call to list the
whole bucket, it does multiple calls, one for each pseudo directory.
However these are done in parallel so in practice this seems to speed
up directory listings.

This replaces the existing sync method as it performs faster and uses
less memory.

The old sync method is available with the temporary --old-sync-method
flag.

Optional interfaces are becoming more important in rclone,
--track-renames and --backup-dir both rely on them.

Up to this point rclone has used interface upgrades to define optional
behaviour on Fs objects.  However when one Fs object wraps another it
is very difficult for this scheme to work accurately.  rclone has
relied on specific error messages being returned when the interface
isn't supported - this is unsatisfactory because it means you have to
call the interface to see whether it is supported.

This change enables accurate detection of optional interfaces by use
of a Features struct as returned by an obligatory Fs.Features()
method.  The Features struct contains flags and function pointers
which can be tested against nil to see whether they can be used.

As a result crypt and hubic can accurately reflect the capabilities of
the underlying Fs they are wrapping."

This changes `ListFn`'s implementation so that if it encounters a not

return of the error between checker goroutines and sends it back to the

The main impetus here is that it allows an external program compiling
against rclone as a package to handle a not found, where it currently it
cannot.

Originally it was thought the upload URL expiring would provide 401
errors so it was excluded from reauth when doing uploads, but on
re-reading the docs and looking at this issue it seems that 401 errors
are only caused by the account token expiring and not the upload token
expiring.

We will refresh both the upload token and account token on a 401 error
while uploading, and just the account token when we get a 401 at any
other time."

The corruption was caused when the file was read to the end thus
setting io.EOF and returning the buffers to the pool.  Seek reset the
EOF and carried on using the buffers that had been returned to the
pool thus causing corruption when other goroutines claimed the buffers
simultaneously.

Fix by resetting the buffer pointers to nil when released and claiming
new ones when seek resets EOF.  Also added locking for Read and Seek
which shouldn't be run concurrently."

This was caused by failing to reset the internal buffer on seek so old

The unit tests didn't detect this because they were reading to the end
of the file to check integrity and thus emptying the internal buffer.

Both code and unit tests were fixed up."

This works by making sure directory listings that use a filter only
iterate the files provided in the filter (if any).

Single file copies now don't iterate the source or destination
buckets.

Note that this could potentially slow down very long `--files-from`
lists - this is easy to fix (with another flag probably) if it causes
anyone a problem.

When rclone is busy doing lots of very long uploads it doesn't refresh
the token. Amazon will fail uploads if they finish when the token is
more than 1 Hour past expiry.

Fix this by keeping track of the number of uploads and refreshing the
token when the token expires if there is an upload in progress."

Amazon Drive sometimes returns errors at the end of large uploads

  * 500 Internal error

The file may have been uploaded correctly though, so, on error, wait
for up to 2 minutes for it to appear if it was fully
uploaded (configure timeout with --acd-upload-wait-time).

Refactor sync/copy/move
  * Don't load the src listing unless doing a sync and --delete-before
  * Don't load the dst listing if doing copy/move and --no-traverse is set

`rclone --no-traverse copy src dst` now won't load either of the
listings into memory so will use the minimum amount of memory.

This change will reduce the amount of memory rclone uses dramatically
too as in normal operations (copy without --notraverse or sync) as it
no longer loads the source file listing into memory at all.

Before this change rclone would retry only the page that was missing
from the directory listing.  However it turns out that on 429 errors
at least, that page is gone from the directory listing which results
in missing files in the list.  The workaround for this is to restart
the directory listing on any retryable errors."

Protects all variables in the pacer from concurrent modifications. It is now safe to modify pacer settings while it is running.

Changed ""ls"" command not to show modification time by default only
size and path.  That is because it is slow for nearly all the remotes
as it requires extra metadata lookup.  All remotes can look up files
and sizes without extra operations.

Added ""lsl"" which does what ""ls"" used to - namely show modification
time, size and path.

Added ""md5sum"" which produces the same output as the md5sum command -
md5sums and paths that is."
