FactoryBot threw a deprecation warning when I copied the example from the
readme:

```
  DEPRECATION WARNING: Static attributes will be removed in FactoryBot 5.0. Please use dynamic
  attributes instead by wrapping the attribute value in a block:

  to { [{:full=>""to_user@email.com"", :email=>""to_user@email.com"", :token=>""to_user"", :host=>""email.com"", :name=>nil}] }
```

This updated the readme to use dynamic attributes."

1.0.0 includes several breaking changes, including:

* Remove the options to configure the address formats for to, from, and
  cc. All of these will now return all of the components in a Hash,
  which was the default for to and cc and an corresponds to the previous
  :hash configuration option.

  It is trivially simple as a Griddler consumer to map these addresses
  to the interesting part of the address, but decidedly non-trivial to
  support the configuration options.

  This is a breaking change, as you will no longer be able to configure
  these options and the value of from is no longer what was previously
  the default (:full). https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/pull/150

* We now initialize the processor class (i.e., EmailProcessor) with
  Griddler::Email object and then call the processor method
  (i.e., #process) on the resulting object. In some cases, this won't be
  a big deal as it was common to have the class-level methods do exactly
  this, but now you can get rid of that class method.
  https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/pull/153

* Remove generated email_processor route. Griddler now requires that you
  either create your own route pointing to the
  Griddler::EmailsController or that you use the mount_griddler helper
  in your config/routes.rb. 4a1fb503bc9be59f031e654dddacb080376c8f04
  https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/pull/149

* Griddler previously introduced the concept of adapters as a means of
  supporting different services. While this allowed Griddler's user base
  to grow, these adapters were prone to errors and became a maintenance
  burden. Rather than dropping support for these services, all adapters
  (including SendGrid) have been extracted from Griddler and will be
  maintained by people who have more experience in their use. Griddler
  now requires the use of an adapter to function, so you will need to
  add both griddler and an adapter to your Gemfile. Adapters are
  outlined in the README.
  https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/issues/124

* Change the supported Ruby version to the latest in the 2.0.* and
  2.1.* ranges and Rails version to the stable versions of 4.0 and 4.1.
  We run tests against the master version of Rails and are try to make
  sure than any failures are on the Rails side and not Griddler's, but
  those are a lower priority. These versions basically match the
  supported versions of Ruby and Rails.
  https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/pull/125

1.0.0 also includes a slew of bug fixes and minor improvements:

* Move be_normalized_to matcher to Griddler::Testing so that it can be
  used for adapter gems.
* Remove Postmark and CloudMailin adapters.
* Remove all references to adapter gems in code.
* Update body parser regex to allow for new lines.
* Add pry to help debugging during development.
* Add NEWS with changes since 0.6.4. Future contributors should keep
  this up to date for changes that an average Griddler user would be
  interested in (i.e., new features but not an implementation detail
  change).

Since 1.0.0-alpha.1:
--------------------

* Replace mailgun adapter with gem

For 1.0.0:
----------

1.0.0 includes several breaking changes, including:

* Remove generated email_processor route. Griddler now requires that you
  either create your own route pointing to the
  Griddler::EmailsController or that you use the mount_griddler helper
  in your config/routes.rb. 4a1fb503bc9be59f031e654dddacb080376c8f04
  https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/pull/149

* Griddler previously introduced the concept of adapters as a means of
  supporting different services. While this allowed Griddler's user base
  to grow, these adapters were prone to errors and became a maintenance
  burden. Rather than dropping support for these services, all adapters
  (including SendGrid) have been extracted from Griddler and will be
  maintained by people who have more experience in their use. Griddler
  now requires the use of an adapter to function, so you will need to
  add both griddler and an adapter to your Gemfile. Adapters are
  outlined in the README.
  https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/issues/124

* Change the supported Ruby version to the latest in the 2.0.* and
  2.1.* ranges and Rails version to the stable versions of 4.0 and 4.1.
  We run tests against the master version of Rails and are try to make
  sure than any failures are on the Rails side and not Griddler's, but
  those are a lower priority. These versions basically match the
  supported versions of Ruby and Rails.
  https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/pull/125

1.0.0 also includes a slew of bug fixes and minor improvements:

* Better handle `to` from Mailgun.
* Better error for missing EmailProcessor.
* Remove Rails warning messages in specs.
* Exit if bundler is not installed.
* Make README friendlier.
* Remove 0.5.0 upgrade note from README.md regarding mount_griddler.
* Update to RSpec 3.0.
* Link to new version of Giant Robots blog."

`ENV[""RAILS_VERSION""]` was being set to Rails branch names (like `4-0-stable`),
but was being used as a normal version constraint. This led to declarations
like:

    gem ""rails"", ""~> 4-0-stable.0""
    # or
    gem ""rails"", ""~> 4-1-stable.0""

Both of these were translated by Rubygems into ""get the latest version"", so they
both tested against the same version of Rails, currently 4.1.2.rc1.

You can see this here: https://travis-ci.org/thoughtbot/griddler/builds/26420309

This commit makes it so we always interpret `ENV[""RAILS_VERSION""]` as a branch
name. We still fall back to testing against Rails 4.0.0 if the environment
variable is unset."

I am deprecating the token option because with the possibility of
getting multiple recipients it becomes dangerous to operate only on the
token.

Take, for example, an email delivered to `topic.1@griddler.com` and to
`sam@looped-in-to-conversation.com`. With only tokens, the client
application would only see ['sam', 'topic.1'], which could cause
problems.

:token will remain available through the :hash option, which is now the
default option."

While this is a change that will break backward compatibility, it is
ultimately beneficial in that it will simplify the implementation of
`EmailProcessor`s, which can now simply loop over the recipients in
`email.to` and check to see if the address is relevant to their app.

This will also fix problems which may have been hidden when `email.to`
returns only one of potentially several addresses, in what may not have
been a valid format depending on an app's `Griddler.configuration.to`
setting.

* Convert all adapters to wrap `normalized_params[:to]` in an array,
  even for a single recipient.
* Add a feature spec for the integration between adapters and
  `Griddler::Email` which ensures that the parsed address is the same
  regardless of email service."
