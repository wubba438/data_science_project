Instead of assuming that a back press should change the state from EXPANDED to PEEKED, this can now be controlled through BottomSheetLayout.setDismissMode(State). The default is HIDDEN, which completely dismisses the Bottom Sheet when back is pressed in EXPANDED state.

Updates MenuActivity sample to demonstrate BottomSheetLayout.setDismissMode(State)."
