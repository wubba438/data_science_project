My hunch is that, since the switch to using brow.sh as the default
homepage, the extra page load time has an undesirable effect on
subsequent requests for new tabs. For example, say that a new tab
is requested but the original brow.sh tab hasn't completed, but
it does complete halfway through another tab loading. Might it retake
focus and prevent DOM load events triggering in the user-requested
tab?

So for now, the quickest fix is just to increase the wait time in the
tests. The better fix, if my hunch is right, would be to detect and
wait for the original launch-time tab to finish."

Such a big commit to provide a fix which really only involves a few
lines in the graphics builder. It would seem that the very first time
the BlockCharMono font is rendered it needs a little delay. So there's a
refactor here to use a callback when requesting a screenshot with text.

All the other code in this commit is just the scaffolding to try to fix
this issue. It's all good stuff in itself. Basically stricter code
triggers for the different stages of page load: tab load, DOM ready,
page ready. I actually wonder if the TTY page loads feel snappier now?

That is the result of having `pressed CTRL+\`. Then add something

Firstly Firefox 60 now throws an error if its run as root inside a
user's home path. Which is great because that revelead my naivety about
using `RUN su user` in the Dockerfile. So now Firefox is running as a
non-root user inside Docker which is what was always best.

Also it turns out that the crude 3 second wait at startup hoping that
Firefox's Marionette had started listening, wasn't good enough. So now
we're actually listening for a log message to know when it's started
now.

Finally make all startup methods use a the post-webext connection state

This was primarily to get native diff'ed frame rendering.
Termbox-go doesn't support true colours, thus the switch to Tcell, but
as it turns out Tcell claims to have wider platform support, so it looks
like an especially good change.

So now the CLI will only try to update the terminal screen when cells
actually change. This has some significant performant gains, especially
when using Browsh over SSH.

Also note that this required a complete change of the frame data
structure sent over the websocket. Previously it was a little
structured, but now it is just a plain 1 dimensional array of pure
strings, even the RGB components are sent as integers in strings. If I
can find a way to unmarshal mixed arrays in  Golang then it'll be worth
sending a mixed JSON array to save some compute overhead."

This means that Browsh can now be entirely run just by running the CLI

via the Marionette protocol, installs the webextension and finally
triggers a new tab with, currently, the Google homepage in it.

I was trying to set this up for automated testing as well by installing
the built webextension as a temporary addon, because otherwise you need
to sign the extension everytime with a unique semantic version. However
for some reason I can't quite recreate the environment that MDN's
`web-ext` creates. The extension installs fine but fails to load the
`content.js` script, I can't find a backtrace or any other details about
the failure. So for now, we're just going to have to use `web-ext` as
seperate process and have the client connect to that. Which is what one
should do during development anyway, so it's not a huge loss."

The big problem with XFCE's zoom was that it follwed the mouse. So there was no way
to have the terminal representation of the desktop map to a smaller segment of the
real desktop without the terminal mouse position being able to exactly 'hover' over
the real mouse position.

The xzoom program is a window that displays a zoom of a portion of the desktop. So
double the width of the desktop and place the xzoom window on the right, but have
it watch only the half of the desktop on the left. What's more xzoom is small and
it's C code is easily incuded in the Golang code so they act as one, even sharing
state such as mouse coords, viewport position, current zoom level, etc.

WIP. Still contains old XFCE zoom code."
