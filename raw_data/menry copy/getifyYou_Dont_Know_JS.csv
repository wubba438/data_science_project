This broke my reading flow, and I'm intrigued which was intended:
""Many see this as..."" - a softer assertion, does not claim to be globally correct.
""Many see that this is..."" - stronger, reflects what I think the author actually believes (but I'm not sure they intend to speak for everybody)...

'tis a nit, but thanks for taking the time to look at this! :)"

I think what happened here is that some over-eager spell-checker liked ""equitable"" better.
But ""equitable"" seems to mean ""characterized by equity or fairness; just and right; fair;
reasonable"", and ""equatable"" (as in ""coming up as equal in an equality comparison"") makes
a lot more sense here. A third ""equatable"" earlier in the first paragraph seems to support
this, too."
