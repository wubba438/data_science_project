If multiple AndroidManifest.xml files specify FileProviders (e.g. the app, a library like react-native-image-picker), you may receive compilation errors when these AndroidManifest.xml files are merged due to conflicts in fields such as `android:authorities` and `android:resource`.

This occurs when multiple AndroidManifest.xml files specify a `android.support.v4.content.FileProvider`. To avoid the conflict, we subclass `android.support.v4.content.FileProvider` and then we refer to our subclass in the AndroidManifest.xml file to avoid the conflict.

This solution is described here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/41550634"

Initial support for recording video or picking videos from the image picker. The code now looks for 'mediaType' to determine if it should take a 'photo' or a 'video'.
Added code to use the option key 'qualityType' to set 'high', 'medium' and 'low' image quality settings. Defaults to 'medium'.
Added code to check the option key 'imageFileType'. imageFileType === 'png' exports the photo as PNG instead of JPG. Defaults to JPG if imageFileType is not set or if set to any value other than 'png'.
Added some error reporting when some steps fail, rather than just writing to the console and either ignoring the error or returning early.
