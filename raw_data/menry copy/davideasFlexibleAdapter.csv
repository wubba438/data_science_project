* fixed app crash — fast scroller must be set first before adding an OnScrollStateChangeListener

* moved the animator methods to a separate class to make FastScroller focused on fast scrolling;
made some methods protected so that it can easily be extended such as in ModifiedFastScroller

* ignored touch events on the fast scroller when the recyclerview is not scrollable

* added custom attribute to enable/disable the bubble

* added FastScrollerDelegate and FastScrollerAdapterInterface to make it easier to use FastScroller, even if SelectableAdapter will not be used. see the description in FastScrollerDelegate for more info.

* removed setting the bubble and handle color since this is already defined in the xml

* deprecated the bubbleAndHandleColor. setting the color in the drawable is enough — if the user wants different color for bubble and handle, just change the drawable xml

* removed dependency of FastScroller from eu.davidea.flexibleadapter.utils.Utils

* fixed animation bug when user is scrolling near the edge

* added option to ignore touches outside the handle

- Fixed refreshing the list.
- Fixed screen rotation with selected items.
- Fixed delayed adding and removing without impacts for the current selection.
- Adding, updating, removing, moving and swapping main items with specific positions, must always be done via previous call getGlobalPositionOf() as usual.
- Updating the empty view gives the size of the main items, excluding headers/footers (this must be evaluated with the others developers).
- Fixed showing / hiding headers positions.
- Modified the demoApp to use the new items

Resolves #233 - New EndlessScrollListener behaviors for onLoadMore() and onLoadMoreComplete(). Loading more now handles:
- New items less than pageSize previously set.
- Total item count reached the target previously set.
- None of the above is set, the Adapter will always attempt to load more.
- Endless scroll / loading more: progressItem becomes a footer item but it will be always displayed between the main items and the others footers.
- Prepared the code to loading more on the Top.
- Modified the demoApp to show how to use the new progressItem"

Fixed #146 - Improved calls to setDisplayHeadersAtStartUp() and showAllHeaders() to avoid duplication of headers by a non correct initialization (documentation will follow).
Adapter can be initialized with a null or empty list: addItems() can be safely called, but no scrolling animation on loading can be performed.
Expand items at startup can now expand all Levels of Expandable, if expanded is initially set true. updateDataSet() is also compatible with the last status of sub levels."
