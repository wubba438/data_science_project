Before, if a line was sparse, for example an error counter

There would be one state item per matching grouping when data
was present and they would only get moved forward if there was
data for that key in a given interval. For intervals with no
data, a no data line would get pushed through and have its own
independent state.

With this change, an empty group by result will push an empty
data set through eval and it will now move the state buffers
to allow for expiration and correct handling of subsequent
intervals with data. If there is no resulting data lines from
the overall expression, then a no data line for the overall
expression will be emitted to the user."

Updates the online algorithms used with stateful operators
to detect if the state is effectively empty. In that case
the state will be dropped from the state map maintained
during evaluation. This is useful to avoid leaking memory
for tracking the state during long running streaming
evaluations.

There are currently three exceptions that have an unbounded
window and never become empty: ignore-N, sdes, and integral.
Integral is generally not very useful in a streaming context
so we may just prohibit that operation. For sdes (and ignore-N
which is typically only used to align sdes), the current uses
do not involve group by operations, so it shouldn't be an
issue for now. We'll revisit in the future when there are
concrete use-cases that are problematic for that operation."

This is meant as an alternative to `:trend` that fixes a
number of issues with that operator. Specifically:

1. The denominator for the average is the number of actual
   values, that is non-NaN entries, within the rolling buffer.
   The `:trend` operator always uses the window size which
   can create confusing drops because `NaN` values are
   effectively 0.
2. The minimum number of values permitted before emitting
   a mean can be specified by the user.
3. It is more consistent with other stateful operators in
   that it works on a window size relative to the step
   interval rather than a fixed time duration.
4. It is more consistent with similar operators in other
   tools such as the `rolling_mean` function provided by
   Panda.

We're hitting CloudWatch rate limits on a regular basis. However, the
AWS limits should be sufficient for our overall per second call rate in
the majority of cases. The current pattern of calls has bursts when the
`Tick` message kicks off a collection, which causes the call rate to
spike above the per second limit. This commit introduces call rate
limiting to smooth out the request pattern.

The Akka documentation for throttling request/response actor
communication is incomplete. Through iteration playing around in a local
toy app, I arrived at the implementation herein and confirmed that it
works as expected.

For this use case, it's important to ensure that either all or none of
the `MetricMetadata` elements are added for processing. To satisfy that
requirement, the full list is sent to the actor `Source` which then uses
`flatMapConcat` to send each element individually through the throttle
phase. This provides a stronger guarantee than the default, which could
drop elements if the queue fills up. In practice, memory is more likely
to be the limiting factor, given actors have unbounded mailboxes by
default. Case in point, it was difficult to trigger the drop scenario in
the local toy app. However, this approach more deterministically
provides the stronger guarantee."

Since 2.11 doesn't support the `--release` option, building

prunes the item set by doing a lookup for that key value. The

It mostly impacts queries that are projecting all values for
a common tag without other restrictions.

to show a noticeable change as expected. Before it was about
4864.472 ops/s and after 357671.851 ops/s.

rename `frequency` to `step` and the `/lwc` prefix is removed

client will still work with the messages coming from older
lwcapi services running.

This change also use the model objects from the eval client
on the server side for the websocket endpoint to help ensure
better consistency of the messages in the future. The old
endpoints have not been changed to preserve compatibility

There are a number of use-cases where it is convenient to
be able to render a chart based on the uri without going
through the webapi. Examples:

- Alerting through LWC with a certain buffer for the data
  being streamed through. If an alert triggers, then it
  is desirable to be able to include context in the email
  or other notification. The graph image helps the user
  understand why it fired.
- Spark queries over the data in S3. We want to be able
  to let a user use the exact same graph uri they use for
  the main backend and run it on spark.

This is an initial step and we'll try it out a bit to see
what changes make sense. A subset of the tests from the
GraphApiSuite have been moved over. Most of the rest will
follow later on so we can ensure that there isn't anything
being added in the graph layer."

This change relaxes the language restrictions a bit

The EurekaGroupsLookup stage creates a source to regularly
refresh the set of Eureka vips that are needed based on the
requested data sources. When a new set of data sources comes
in, it will stop the old source and create a new one.

The problem is when a new set of data sources comes in quickly
it could stop the source refreshing Eureka groups after the
request was made and before the response was processed. In
this scenario the `max-open-requests` limit would eventually
be reached and all subsequent requests would fail.

There are two changes included here:

1. Before the source was stopped using a `takeWhile` operator
   at a later stage. Now it is stopped by changing the source
   to indicate it is done and no longer has data. This means
   that the subsequent stages of the flow should go ahead and
   run and so the response body of any outstanding requests will
   get processed. The BufferOverflowException is still possible
   with just this change if too many changes occur in a short
   period, however, they will eventually clear up if the rate
   goes down.
2. The input is now throttled and conflated so that if many
   changes to the set of data sources come in a short window
   all but the last will get ignored."

This needs a bit more work and consideration, but the
change here resolves the most common and easy to reproduce
problem. When a new connection comes in with an id that
is already in use, it will replace the previous connection
and that stream is unregistered before setting up the
registration for the new connection stream. This creates
a race condition:

1. GET /stream/id
    1. unregister(id), noop nothing present for id
    2. register(id)
2. GET /stream/id
    1. unregister(id), removes the previous and shutsdown
       the connection
    2. register(id), sets up new registration
    3. SSEActor.postStop -> unregister(id), unregisters the
       newly created actor

With this change the postStop method for SSEActor will not
attempt to unregister again because we know it has already
been unregistered."

changed to be less aggressive. To minimize the visibility
pf the problem for a user consuming the metric the last
datapoint is now cached and the reported value comes
from the local cache.

This does mean that when such a problem is happening the wrong
value might be propagated for several minutes. From recent
testing though in the more typical case it avoids confusion
more often until there is a better way to access cloudwatch

Some of the primitive collections have also been adjusted
to use murmur hash instead of `Long.hashCode(v)` because
the collision rate was way to high. This adds a bit of
memory overhead because we copy the value into a
pre-allocated byte buffer to reuse the murmur hash
implementation provided in the scala std library."

Adds an `Evaluator` class with a simple public API
for evaluating the stream. It is a java class that
exposes the reactive streams types so it is easy to
use with various implementations. There are two
main methods:

**createPublisher(uri)**

Creates a publisher for a graph uri so the same data
can be accessed as a stream. This makes it really easy
for a user to transition from one view to another.

```
+------------+
|  URI       |
|  Eval      | -------- [TimeSeriesMessage] --->
|  Source    |
+------------+
```

**createStreamsProcessor**

Takes a set of id/URI pairs as inputs and evaluates
all of the expressions. This allows for better reuse
when evaluating many expressions. There is an id
for each input that will be added to the output so
that corresponding entries can be correlated.
The complete set of current data sources must be
supplied as part of each input event.

```
                       +------+
                       |      |
--- [DataSources] ---> | Eval | --- [MessageEnvelope] --->
  Set((id,URI), ...)   |      |   (id, TimeSeriesMessage)

Some initial performance checks on the streaming

contributor was converting from ByteString to
a form that jackson could parse. This has been
reduced by reusing buffers. Some other minor
changes have been made to reduce allocations for
fields and to go direct to SmallHashMap for the
tag data.

Biggest bottlenecks right now are parsing the
json messages from the SSE stream followed by
the materialization speed. The materialization
speed should be less of an issue in practice

Fixes a bug with the expression string for named rewrites
that contain offsets. If the rewrite is being used similar
to an aggregate function and the display expression is a
query, then the offset was getting lost because that is an
attribute of the aggregate functions that are only present
in the expanded evaluation expression.

Now the named rewrite will extract the offset and group by
information if the display type is a query. For others the
rewrite will be re-evaluated using the same interpreter."

This isn't yet fully baked or hardened, but is a good
enough check point. This is an initial version of a
library to evaluate expressions using the LWC service
as a source.

Still left to do:

1. Expose simple and stable java API for accessing
   the stream for a corresponding graph uri. This is
   to make it really easy to transition between the
   backend graph and a streaming source.
2. Source identification in LWC so we can reliably
   dedup messages.
3. Improving test coverage of Eureka source and
   evaluator helpers. This is really sparse right
   now.
4. Refactor Datapoint so that the step size is provided
   rather than coming from a static config.
5. Performance testing and tuning.

This change allows datapoints to be rolled up as they
are flowing into the in memory storage. Typically this
has been done later as part of offline processing using
EMR or via a separate aggregator cluster that would
perform the aggregations prior to being sent to the
in memory storage.

To be eligible for the rollup the data must have already
been normalized to the step boundary and rate conversion
for counters should have already been performed.

The inline rollup will create a rollup block so it will
have more overhead in terms of memory use unless the
reduction multiple is over 4. Data will only go through
the rollup path if it is tagged with `atlas.rollup=true`.

The publish payload can now take an `id` field which will
get used to dedup messages. If used, then it should avoid
over counting if retries are present in the publishing
pipeline as long as the updates for a given datapoint are
always mapped to the same id for a given interval. The
message id should not be used for multiple intervals or
subsequent messages would incorrectly get lost."

If a heartbeat interval larger than the step is applied to
rates, then it can artificially inflate the overall count.
This can happen on occasion with the expiration pattern
used by spectator and servo when reporting counters if
the counter gets an update exactly one interval after it
expired.

Counters should be fine because they will compute the
delta and average over the missed interval. The heartbeat
is retained for this use-case as poller using a fixed
delay may have a reporting interval that is slightly
larger than the specified step.

The DiagnosticMessage object had some helper methods
left over for sending an error response to an ActorRef.
These will not work correctly using `akka-http` and
the usages would not work as expected.

* `TagsRequestActor`: using the handleExceptions which
  would not send the exception to the correct place
  if caught. This has been changed to remove the actor
  and inline into the tags api using an ask on the
  db actor. For now a timeout of 60s is used, but that
  should probably get changed. Ideally the future will
  get mapped directly to the data request call and then
  the server request timeout will be sufficient. That
  way there would be no nested timeouts. Will follow
  up on that front in later PRs.
* `EvaluateActor`: was broken. It would ignore the
  `ImperativeRequestContext` messages being sent and
  the user would get a request timeout. This was also
  inlined into the evaluate api as there doesn't seem
  to be a good reason for the separate actor. Still
  need to create a test case for the evaluate api."

May need to find a better, name. LWC (lightweight
client) API is meant to provide a simple intermediate
service so we can remove a lot of the functionality
that has built up in the java client over time. This
is especially important given increasing internal
emphasis on polyglot and stream processing.

Many of the features in the internal Atlas client
library follow the pattern of taking a data expression
and outputting the data to it. These grew over time
so there are now a bunch of different forms such as
on-instance alert, cloudwatch publishing, file logging,
critical clusters, etc. The LWC API can be used as
a common service where those use-cases will subscribe
to get the data from the clients. The actual client
library then only needs to support subscriptions and
understand the query/data expr subset of stack expressions
to allow for local filtering and aggregation."

Values between 0.0 and 1.0 were not being handled

always be >= 1.0.

Adds a `scale` parameter to the graph api that takes
a string value representing the scale type to use. This
replaces the boolean flag `o` parameter used to indicate
a logarithmic scale. The `o` param is still supported
as a fallback if `scale` is not set for backwards
compatibility.

The primary advantages of this change are to potentially
allow for additional scale types and to allow any scale
type to be explicitly set in the configuration. With the
previous settings linear was only available as the default
if logarithmic was not set.

This change also adds power scales (`y=a*x^e+b`) with
exponents of 2 (`pow2`) and 0.5 (`sqrt`)."

  all other data. This means it is available for teeing
  to stream processing systems, long term storage in
  hive, etc.
* Querying CloudWatch on-demand does not scale well
  and it fails frequently due to throttles. In this
  case there is a consistent load all the time, but
  we can tune that for the needed set and avoid the
  really high bursts needed for on-demand queries.
* If we are lucky Amazon will support a way to get a
  stream of all CloudWatch metric data and we can
  switch to consuming that in the future. In the

Overrides equals for SmallHashMap to improve the performance.
The two main changes are to use the cache hash code as a filter
and simply compare the elements of the array. This does much
better than the default inherited from GenMapLike that more or
less does:

```scala
this.forall { t => other.get(t._1) == Some(t._2) }
```

If the elements are not inserted in the same order, then they
may be in a different order in the array due to collisions.
However, others will be in the correct position and we can
limit the lookups to ones where there is a mismatch.

**Equal Maps**

Checking where the maps being compared are equal:

```
Benchmark                     Mode  Cnt          Score          Error  Units
currentEquals                thrpt   10   47004215.059 ±  2291847.719  ops/s
inheritedEquals              thrpt   10    2134457.383 ±   111821.520  ops/s
dataEquals                   thrpt   10   51326103.645 ±   758297.787  ops/s
selfEquals                   thrpt   10  351279563.043 ± 18578115.816  ops/s
```

Note:

* `currentEquals` - is SmallHashMap.equals, it does some
  sanity checks and then calls `dataEquals`.
* `inheritedEquals` - is the GenMapLike.equals.
* `dataEquals` - is the method used for comparing the array.
* `selfEquals` - is comparing against the same instance of the
  map. Just sanity checks that the special case is fast.

**Not Equal Maps**

Checking maps that are almost equal except that one data value
is different. Using the cached hash code as a pre filter is the
biggest contributor:

```
currentEqualsNot             thrpt   10  273893522.221 ±  7980051.600  ops/s
inheritedEqualsNot           thrpt   10    2341207.187 ±   206356.584  ops/s
dataEqualsNot                thrpt   10   32392263.165 ±  1289262.059  ops/s
```

**Equal with Different Order**

Comparing equal maps, but constructed such that the order in the
underlying array is different. This means we have to do more
lookups rather than just traversing the array. For the examples
though there are typically still quite a few entries that are
in the same position for both maps.

```
currentEqualHashCodes        thrpt   10   14601802.119 ±   360902.793  ops/s
inheritedEqualHashCodes      thrpt   10     483515.784 ±    10044.781  ops/s

Most of the allocations for computing ids were for

reuses it for each run.

Performance is a little bit better:

reduced by ~6.5GB."

Previously, multi-y would enable a mode where there
would be one color use per axis by default. This is
to discourage creating confusing graphs where it is
difficult or impossible to figure out which axis a
line corresponds with. It is still recommended to
avoid using more that one line per axis when using
multi-y.

This change modifies the behavior of the palette so
that by default each line will take the next color
from the main palette. This behavior seems to be less
confusing to most users, though it doesn't help to
discourage the anti-pattern of creating confusing
charts where the lines cannot be accurately associated
with an axis.

The behavior if an explicit palette is specified for
a given axis is not changed."

Refactors the `:sdes` operator to properly handle evaluation
with incremental updates. Before the `pos` was never getting
updated, so the first value would get set to `NaN` and all others
would not be modified.

As part of this change the code was refactored a bit so that
the `OnlineSlidingDes` instance is now part of the state object.
This means that the state passed in to eval will get modified.
For now that is ok, but the plan is to clean it up in future commits
as part of making the state serializable."

Provides a style operator, `:decode`, that can be
used to perform hex decoding of the legend text.

Background: internally we restrict input to simple
alpha-numeric characters, `.`, `-`, and `_`. if
characters are used the data will get dropped as
invalid. If using the servo-atlas module, then it
will convert invalid characters to `_`. Most
commonly that was done for spaces.

The restriction is to ensure that it is easy and
safe to craft the query expressions and include
them as part of the URI in a variety of contexts.
Precise linkability is extremely important and
should not be compromised.

Some users do their own url encoding and the `%`
then gets converted to an `_`. This allows them
to undo the restriction and get the original
characters back. With this change that decoding
can now be specified as part of the expression.

There are quite a few misgivings about this
feature. In my view this feature encourages bad
behavior such as trying to encode structural
information into tag values or trying to abuse
it as a more general purpose data store. The
compromise for now is supporting the decode
with a clear warning in the docs and we'll see
how it goes."

The default apply will create a map with the exact size
of the input to optimize for memory use. This results
in terrible performance for lookups of items that are not
in the map because the entire array has to be scanned.

In this case we use the builder and give 2x the size of
the input so there will be 50% unused entries. Since we
expect many misses this gives us better performance and
memory overhead isn't too bad. It is still much lower
than default immutable map since we don't need entry
objects.

**Memory Usage**

Memmory use for 100 queries from logs:

```
Object                         Size (bytes)
-------------------------------------------
Query index default map             466,632
Query index small before            246,568
Query index small after             241,064
```

Note that the reduction here is because there are many
small maps with less than 5 items. These now keep the
special cased default maps for those sizes. So we see
a bit of a reduction overall even though the size of the
actual SmallHashMap intances will be larger."

The query index was just recursively building
the query index tree resulting in many common
sub-trees. This is wasteful for both computation
and memory use. This change adds a simple map
to lookup if a sub-index has already been
computed.

For the naive test query set it doesn't result
in all that big of a reduction:

```
Object                         Size (bytes)
-------------------------------------------
Input queries                        22,896
Query index                          27,560
Query index w/ reuse                 24,968
```

Subtracting out the size of the input queries:

```
Object                         Size (bytes)
-------------------------------------------
Query index                           4,664
Query index w/ reuse                  2,072
```

Around 50% reduction in overhead for the index.
Looking at a real dataset of 100 queries pulled
from logs we see a much bigger reduction:

```
Object                         Size (bytes)
-------------------------------------------
Input queries                        27,256
Query index                      65,700,776
Query index w/ reuse                466,632

The biggest chunk of memory usage for the test query set
is coming from the query objects themselves. Sizes:

```
Object                         Size (bytes)
-------------------------------------------
Input queries                        71,976
Query index                          76,640
Input queries w/ interning           22,896
```

This is just an example as part of the test. It was needed
so we could test larger data sets without getting an OOM
exception. It is not being rolled into the query index
because it would likely need to be done earlier while
processing input queries. The mechanism can be copied from
the test case for now if it is needed. If a more generic
utility is found to be generally useful going forward,
then we'll revisit."

For the experimental v2.json format this changes the

Before the metadata for a plot would be emitted followed
by all lines on that plot. That would be repeated for
each plot. The problem with this is that format becomes
cumbersome for a streaming evaluation where we only have
data for a single time interval at a time. With this
change the same format can be used for the normal
evaluation or a streaming evaluation."

Adds an expr endpoint for extracting the queries [1] from
a stack expression. This can be useful for UIs that need
to further explore the tag space associated with a graph
expression. Output is a list of all distinct queries used.

Example, suppose I have a graph of requests and errors:

```
nf.app,www,:eq,name,http.req.complete,:eq,:and,(,statusCode,),:by
```

And I want to expand it to get one graph per zone or node
for the application. Send a request:

```
GET /api/v1/expr/queries?q=nf.app,www,:eq,name,http.req.complete,:eq,:and,(,statusCode,),:by
```

The response is:

```json
[
  ""nf.app,www,:eq,name,http.req.complete,:eq,:and""
]
```

This data can then be used with the
[tags API](https://github.com/Netflix/atlas/wiki/Tags) to get
all of the matching zones, nodes, etc.

Previously the `/healthcheck` endpoint provided here always
returned 200 and was mostly used for debugging. This is now
`/ok`. The `/healthcheck` endpoint now indicates the service
health based on the ServiceManager so it should be usable
as a load balancer healthcheck endpoint.

With this change we shouldn't need a separate internal
healthcheck endpoint registered for use with the load
balancers and monitoring."

Adds `tick_labels` param to control the mode used for
the tick labels. Three values are supported:

* `off`: disable tick labels. This was previously done
  using `no_tick_labels=1`.
* `decimal`: default mode using decimal metric unit
  prefixes for tick labels.
* `binary`: added to use binary prefixes (powers of 1024
  instead of 1000) for displaying data in bytes such as
  disk usage in a way that is less likely to cause
  confusion when comparing with other sources. For example,
  by default `free -h` will display disk usage using powers
  of 1024. They will show as `Ki`, `Mi`, `Gi`, `Ti`, `Pi`,
  `Ei`, `Zi`, or `Yi` following the IEC convention and to
  make it clear whether or not the decimal or binary mode
  was used when viewing the data."

Adds a `:percentiles` helper to compute estimated percentiles
for spectator PercentileTimer and PercentileDistributionSummary.
These use a precomputed set of buckets that partition the range
of non-negative long values to allow for arbitrary slicing and
dicing based on the dimensions and still get a reasonable
approximation of percentiles.

This approach is less accurate than alternatives like t-Digest,
but more efficent and practical for our use-cases.

It is used just after the data function which should be a sum
or group by:

```
name,requestLatency,:eq,(,50,90,),:percentiles
name,requestLatency,:eq,(,nf.cluster,),:by,(,50,90,),:percentiles
```

The output will be one line per input per requested percentile.
There is also a helper, `:median` that is just short hand for
`(,50,),:percentiles`."

Adds PlotBound type used to specify either a specific value
or an automatic bound. The use-case is to support automatic
bounds in two variants:

* `auto-style`: upper and lower bounds based on the visual
  representation of the line. For stack and area styles this
  means that the filled in area should be shown for the automatic
  bound. This mode is the default now, but cannot be made
  explicit.
* `auto-data`: upper and lower bounds based on the data. So
  the line style will not get considered.

For this first commit the PlotBound type is added and all of
the existing tests pass. One change in behvaior was made so that
stack/area plots with a constant value trigger the padding
behavior."

This change adds a query param for setting the palette to
use for a given axis. The existing palette param maintains
the same behavior as before. By default a single color is
used for all lines on an axis so it is easy to understand
which axis is used for a given line. It is still generally
recommended to limit multi-Y charts to have a single line
per axis to minimize confusion.

A param `palette.$n` where `n` is the number of the axis
can be used and that palette will be used for only the
lines on that axis. A few color shade palettes have been
added for convenience that should still work ok for
color blindness."

Updates the routes so that the OPTIONS pre-flight
request will include the CORS headers. This is needed
by at least chrome if certain conditions apply, in
particular, adding various headers.

Example for testing with XMLHttpRequest and the newer
fetch call:

```html
<html>
<head>
<script>
// https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch?hl=en
var url = 'http://localhost:7101/api/v1/tags/nf.region';

function reqListener() {
  var data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
  console.log('info xmlhttprequest: ' + data);
}

function reqError(err) {
  console.log('error xmlhttprequest: ', err);
}

var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
oReq.onload = reqListener;
oReq.onerror = reqError;
oReq.open('get', url, true);
oReq.setRequestHeader('X-Netflix.client.appid', 'foo');
oReq.send();

fetch(url, {headers: {'X-Netflix.client.appid': 'foo'}})
  .then(
    function(response) {
      if (response.status !== 200) {
        console.log('error fetch: ' + response.status);
        return;
      }
      response.json().then(function(data) {
        console.log('info fetch: ' + data);
      });
    }
  )
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.log('error fetch: ' + err);
  });
</script>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
```

Before this would produce errors in the console like:

> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:7101/api/v1/tags/nf.region.
> Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No
> 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
> Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access."

The current indexes allow us to quickly check a query
against many tag sets. For some use-cases, in particular,
stream processing, we need to check a tag set against
many queries.

The specific use-case is inline alert processing. Currently
in the main environment there are around 17k alert expressions
used for alerts. Decomposing those into individual queries
we get around 33k queries. With a quick test of comparing
a real payload of 5000 datapoints to find matches within the
alert query set takes around 6.2s using a naive loop. This
query index takes around 6ms.

We'll likely need to do some further optimization to reduce
the number of allocations when doing the match, but current
testing shows it to be good enough to include in a snapshot
for more experimentation."

The base operator was called `:sliding-des` and all
other variants were `:sdes-*`. With this change `:sdes`
is used consistently for sliding DES operations.

The shorter form was generally preferred because it
makes it much easier to switch between `:des` and `:sdes`
by just changing a single character. When experimenting
and comparing the results of both this is quite handy."

Adds support for providing an explicit list of colors to
the palette option of the graph url. The primary use-case
is to allow less cumbersome customization of colors for
the result of a group by.

For use-cases such as bucket timers some want to customize
the color selection for asthetic reasons and currently that
involves breaking out each element of the group by to manually
assign a color using the `:color` operation. Now the list
can be provided as part of the palette param with a prefix
of 'colors:'. Example:

```
/api/v1/graph
  ?q=
    name,sps,:eq,:sum,(,nf.cluster,),:by,:pct,
    $nf.cluster,:legend,
    :stack
  &palette=colors:1a9850,91cf60,d9ef8b,fee08b,fc8d59,d73027

A large number of allocations were for creating a
string representation of the id. The original reason
was to allow specifying the offset as a simple prefix
of the id hash. In practice we don't rely on that
and all uses seem to be of the full id. By doing the
lookup using the `BigInteger` and not creating the
string copies we significantly reduce the allocation
rate.

For a simple test application the average allocation
rate for a 5m sample window went from 29 MB/s to
20 MB/s."

When using a constant on the stack it will get automatically
converted to a TimeSeriesExpr when the graph is rendered. So
if I have something like:

```
name,sps,:eq,:sum,$name,:legend,42
```

It will work for graph rendering. However, if using `:cq` to
append a query restriction with `:each`, e.g.:

```
name,sps,:eq,:sum,$name,:legend,42,:list,(,app,foo,:eq,:cq,),:each
```

It will fail because 42 is not an Expr. Having `:cq` coerce
to an expression is not desirable because it would change
the type and could break existing queries that apply
additional operations.

With this change `:cq` will ignore values it doesn't understand
and leave them on the stack unmodified."

experimental sliding des operation"

This is still experimental and being added in so we
can test the impact.

One of the common complaints with DES is that to get
the same value for a given time you must start feeding
in data at exactly the same time. So for normal graphs
where it is computed using the window of the chart it
will have slightly different predictions for a given
time. As it is often used for alerting this makes it
cumbersome to try and determine:

1. Why an alarm fired
2. When alarms would have fired for tuning

For these use-cases a model that is deterministic within
a small window would be useful. Sliding DES uses two DES
functions and alternates between them. One will get trained
while the other is getting used, and then the one that was
getting used will get reset and the roles swapped. If the
windows are aligned based on the training size this
provides a simple way to make a DES based prediction
that is deterministic for arbitrary windows.

```
 F1 | A |-- T1 --|-- P1 --|-- T1 --|-- P1 --|-- T1 --|
 F2 | A |        |-- T2 --|-- P2 --|-- T2 --|-- P2 --|

Result:

 R  |-- NaN -----|-- P1 --|-- P2 --|-- P1 --|-- P2 --|

```

Both functions will ignore any data until it reaches a
boundary, even multiple, of the training window. That is
shown as `A` in the diagram above. The first function will
then start training, and after the training window the first
predicted values will get generated.

One side-effect of this approach is that there can be abrupt
transitions when switching from one function to another.
Overall it is not expected to hurt the general usage, but
is visually less appealing. Also, for actual predictions it
seems to help in some cases because the transition can
cause the impact of sharp changes to correct more quickly.

For now, we are adding in a separate `:sliding-des` operator
that can be used for testing with real data. Depending on the
outcome we may change the existing `:des` function to be
`:sliding-des`."

Add support for specifying the exact image size. The height
and width parameters currently specify the dimensions for the
canvas with the actual lines. The image size is then calculated
based on how much room is needed for the title, legend, axes,
etc. This layout makes it easy to get consistent canvas sizes
that will line up on a dashboard if the images are positioned
to the top left.

In some cases, it is desirable to specify the exact image
size, but we want to maintain the ability to get consistent
canvas sizes as much as possible. This change introduces
layouts to permit a fixed size image that will adjust how the
image is rendered based on the size, similar to a responsive
layout used for small screens. Further, the mode can be
toggled for the width and height independently.

**Chart Layout**

The time series chart has a basic layout that looks like:

```
---------------------------------------------------
|                      Title                      |
|       --------------------------                |
|       |       Canvas           |        |       |
| 0L 02 |                        | 12 1L  | 22 2L |
|       |                        |        |       |
|    01 |                        | 11     | 21    |
|       --------------------------                |
|       T1      T2     T3      T4                 |
|                                                 |
|  Legend                                         |
|                                                 |
|  Status                                         |
|                                                 |
|  Warnings                                       |
---------------------------------------------------
```

For both width and height two layout modes are supported:

* `canvas`: the width or height are for the canvas component
   within the chart. This is the default and is the same as the
   previous behavior.
* `image`: the width or height are for the final image not
   including the zoom parameter.

**Image Width**

When specified as an image width the width of the canvas will
grow or shrink as long as it stays above the minimum canvas
width. If it drops below the minimum canvas width, then the
Y-axes will get removed to keep the data visible.

Text such as the title and legends will get suppressed unless
there is room for at least 40 characters to be shown. If warnings
are suppressed a color indicator will still be shown along the
bottom of the image.

**Image Height**

Height behaves similar to width in that the canvas will grow or
shrink as needed. However, the legend in particular is tricky
because it depends on the number of lines that need to be shown
on the chart. For now everything below the time axes will get
removed if the image height mode is used. This will be revisted
in the future if needed.

**URL Parameters**

This change adds a URL paramter `layout` for the graph API that
accepts the following values:

* `canvas`: use canvas sizing for width and height. This is the
  default.
* `image`: use exact image sizing for width and height.
* `iw`: use exact image sizing for the width and canvas sizing
  for the height.
* `ih`: use exact image sizing for the height and canvas sizing
  for the width.

** Limits **

Limits on the image size for height and width will still be in
effect, but will be applied based on the layout. So the max width
for canvas sizing will be the width of the canvas and it will
be the max width of the image if using image sizing."

axis flag. Naming was chosen to stay consistent with existing
flags like `no_legend_stats`."

1. Issue #119, no labels shown if the range of values is small
   compared to the base value. For cases where the number of
   significant digits is too big to fit within the reserved
   area for the tick labels the offset will be included as part
   of the ylabel. Will revisit based on feedback.
2. Allow summary status line when legend is disabled.
3. Stack graphs with negative values are now completely below
   the 0. Previously if there was a negative value with a
   positive value on top, it would be hard to see the overall
   positive and negative contribution.
4. Area and stack should show filled region by default. Previously
   auto-ranging could clip off the area if 0 was not within the range.
5. VSpan was sometimes one interval off from lines leading to confusing
   triggered highlighting on alert visualizations.
6. Notices were hard to see using the side watermark. They have
   now been moved into the warnings block at the bottom and background
   color changed to make it stand out. The bottom notices can now be
   shown if legends are turned off which was the original reason for
   using the watermark.
7. On stacked charts don't draw the sides. This created problems where
   a line that was all 0 stacked on top of another line would be hard
   to interpret. A short duration spike in the bottom line would often
   appear as being a spike in the 0 line stacked on top.

To enable these changes we now fully control the rendering. This should
also give us the flexibility to close out the remaining open issues
for image rendering:

* Add zoom option to allow for retina displays.
* Add options for controlling the exact image dimensions instead of
  just the chart area.
* Provide a summarized legend with many lines instead of just suppressing
  the legend entirely.
* Support option to suppress the labels on the y-axis. The primary
  use case is to make it easier to hide sensitive data on the chart.
  For many cases the sensitive part is just the absolute numbers
  not the overall pattern.
* Heat map rendering."

In the past this wasn't always true, but we will now
handle this in the query aggregation layer.

This change also adds some additional test-cases to
boost confidence for refactoring/merging a few more
internal components.

The tag generated labels don't wind up being empty
very often in practice, but it does happen. For
aggregates this change also defaults to just using
an expression summary on the labels. Bigger win will
be if we can finally stop aggregating tag maps. Looks
like that still breaks a few uses, but may be able
to clean up in one of the upcoming deprecation cycles."

A common case for timers is to divide a `totalTime` stat
by the `count` stat. For intervals where there is no activity
both will have a value of 0. The previous behavior was to
treat this as NaN but we have frequently seen users confuse
that for a failure to report data since it leads to a spotty
chart with a lot of gaps. Now if both the numerator and
denominator are 0, then the value will be 0 to make it more
clear that 0 was explicitly reported and there was no activity
rather than a failure to report.

For uses that need the typical floating point behavior the
`:fdiv` operator can be used instead. It has also been fixed
os that it doesn't special case div by zero to be NaN instead
of Infinity."

There are a number of use-cases where it is convenient
to be able to change the vocabulary used by the graph
api via configuration. Main uses:

1. Experiments such as current work looking at better
   support for percentiles. This could be true of other
   extensions that likely will never be part of core.
2. Internal extensions that only make sense with our
   infrastructure.

This change allows the vocabulary to get set with:

```
atlas.webapi.graph.vocabulary = ""com.foo.CustomVocabulary""
```"

One-JAR's class loader is causing a problems with

```
WARNING: Could not load Finalizer in its own class loader. Loading Finalizer in the current class loader instead. As a result, you will not be able to garbage collect this class loader.

Might be related to: http://sourceforge.net/p/one-jar/bugs/74/

We mainly want a simple way to package so the end-user
can just run `java -jar atlas.jar ...`, so using a simple
launcher that creates a self-extracting jar. After
extracting it uses the built-in URLClassLoader for the
set of jars and invokes a specfied main class.

So far this seems to be working well. The standalone jar
is built with a target in the makefile:

```
$ make one-jar
$ java -jar target/standalone.jar
```

If it still looks like the best approach after some more
testing, I'll create a better sbt task that should be
less system dependent than the current shell commands in
the make file."

This allows us to fix a few annoyances:

1. one-jar inteferes with service loader, so adding a direct
   ref for the spectator binding of the standalone
2. We can cleanup the slf4j-simple dependency that gets excluded
   internally.

Also switching the standalone to use log4j2 binding of slf4j so user
can have more control over behaviour by using a custom config."

For some legacy backward compatibility use-cases
internally we need to support a number of additional
formats. This can potentially be useful for others
that might want to provide a custom output format.

This change adds a config setting:

`atlas.webapi.graph.engines`

The values is a list of class names that implement the
GraphEngine trait. Another consideration we will
table for now is source compatibility between versions.
Internally we only try to maintain compatibility of the
webapi and make no guarantees about compatibility of
source built against the app."

The failures were due to a bug in java.time

about png headers."

I don't have time to debug these right now so disabling
until I can get back to it. All the tests run fine
for me locally, but a number are failing on jenkins.

The first group is two test cases for Strings:

The second is for reading the images on the graph api test.
Note the chart tests which also read images are working fine.
