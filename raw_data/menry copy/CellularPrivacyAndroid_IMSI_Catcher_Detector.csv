Rationale.
OCID allows to download a full daily dump of cell
data in cell_towers.csv.gz or daily incremental data.
Due to bad stability of OCID API it is useful to be able
to locally import cell_towers.csv.

Proposed changes:
1. Added a drawer menu ""Import CellTowers Data"" which launches an intent
   to choose a CSV file or gzipped CSV file with CellTowers data.
2. Async loader in ImportTask that reads a full dump and filters
   it locally with MCC, MNC, cell location just like RequestTask does
   by the API call.
3. ImportTask converts data from CellTowers format (documented) to
   the OCID API CSV format and inserts it to the database with help of
   the RealmHelper.
4. RealmHelper is slightly refactored to allow directly insert data
   without an intermediate file.
5. Added a wrapper around GZIPInputStream because Android implementation
   of GZIPInputStream cannot read files larget than 2 GiB.

Testing.
Tested on Motorola XT1562, Android 6.0.1.
Import from cell_towers.csv.gz fetches approx 1000 records (Moscow) from
29 millions total and took about twenty minutes on debug version.
Unarchived version is much faster."

This should fix #558.

Resolved issues:
- `CellTracker#setNotification()` always fires when `CellTracker#compareLac(CellLocation)` is called since recovering from a dangerous state should update the notification. Aka from MEDIUM to OK
- `RequestTask` provides a listener interface for completion callbacks so `Helpers#getOpenCellData(...)` fires OCID check on success
- Timeout for OCID download increased from default 10 seconds to 60 seconds, since the OCID API is slow as hell.
- If OCID API times out, we display that to the user as a special error message.

The listener callback interface is a bit crude, but is better than having RequestTask do too much."

Pull request #798, solving #794, fails to account for fresh installs & newly
booted phones where the service is not instantiated/running by the time the
menu is created for the first time and a NPE occurs.

If the service is null, simply choose ""false"" since without a service there is
no way tracking is happening.

Added `onPrepareOptionsMenu` implementation that will redraw the checkboxes
depending on the latest truth every time the menu is open. Not sure if this is
unnecessary."

This commit, in my opinion, is a little hax.

and how its stored/represented/displayed at what layers."

Noticed that if OCID doesn't contain a PSC value for cells, the app sets PSC to
`666` in the database. Most places will display ""invalid"" but that's not
translateable.

Refactored the validation method to Cell as static and use it to display the
i18n'd string ""Unknown"" which I feel best conveys when a PSC would be out-of-
bounds.

Future work should translate unknown string for all langs and use it instead of
the `invalid` string literal."

Initial implementation for detection method 1 to compare the CID & LAC with the Cell
Information Table contents as an initial implementation for detection of a changed LAC,
once OCID issues (API key use etc) have been finalised this detection method can be
extended to include checking of external data.

This initial implementation is activated through the drawer menu item titled
""Monitor Cell Information"" which will invoke timed runnable that will poll the Cell
Location details using the selected refresh rate OR default to 25 seconds if
Automatic/Manual has been selected, once testing is complete this can be enabled as a
passive detection method which can could be controlled through a user preference.

As I have no real way of testing this I require testing by other project members who
do have access to equipment or an environment where a changing LAC can be simulated
thus confirming the accuracy of this implementation.

Presently this will only invoke the MEDIUM threat level through the notification and
does not fully implement the capturing and score based method as per the issue details
once further testing is complete the alert and tracking of information can be refined."

First thing you need to do before using this is give a BIG THANK YOU to @E3V3A (E:V:A
on xda) for determining how this implementation was possible because without his
perseverance this would not be possible!

ROOT IS REQUIRED!!

Root terminal methods are used to execute the AT Command Injection so this fragment
will check for both ROOT (su binary) and BUSYBOX to confirm both are available on
your device, if not the execution section of the fragment WILL NOT DISPLAY.

If the initial setup works correctly the next step is trying to determine your Ril
Serial Device through the system property ril.libargs if this is successful then
you are in business and the AT Command Injection system is available for you to test.

This will probably NOT WORK on many devices (such as my i9100) but it will provide
details of the failure if available and display them to the screen but also write them
to the file error.txt in the AIMSICD directory of your external storage.

Have fun and try not to break anything."

Extension of the Samsung MultiRil to attempt hooking of the OemHookStrings method,
presently I am not 100% certain this will work but the basic framework and extensions
have been made to modify the current implementation to deal with the Strings request
data and responses.

This still requires work and as such is currently disabled until further testing
has been completed as it will cause the socket to disconnect.

Huge code cleanup and updates to a number of areas with optimisations across a large
number of packages, some unused imports removed and code comments added to a variety
of methods.

Addressed a number of possible NPE causes through different parts of the application
which will ultimately provide better stability and an increased user experience,
although in saying that these items were not causing any issues that had been reported
but prevention is better then a cure right?!?! :)

Use of Java 1.7 language rules have further allowed updates to take advantage of
the highler langauge level with removal of explicit types within arrays, lists, maps
etc plus other changes.

Unnecessary compatibility library removed which has resulted in a reduction in size
of the APK.

Reversed the previous change to insert the Cell ID and Lac in Hex format to allow
further time to ensure all methods that utilise these variables to be updated, the
original change was made too quickly and resulted in a number of issues so I have
returned to the standard integer format until I have more time to ensure this
change is implemented correctly."

Cell Tracking consolidated to include the following PhoneStateListeners:
 - Cell Location (LAC, CID etc)
 - Signal Strength (GSM & CDMA/EVDO)
 - Data State
 - Data Activity

system, all references have been removed including menus, Map & Db Viewers etc.

DISCLAIMER ACCEPTANCE REQUIRED
Activity will now force acceptance as requested in Github issue, if the user does not accept
the disclaimer then both the service and activity will exit and the Package Manager will be
invoked prompting to uninstall AIMSICD. If cancelled then the disclaimer will again appear
and the process will repeat until either accepted or the application uninstalled.

OpenCellID data with details included in the popup, this will be extended shortly with a
custom Info Window to provide a better display of identified cell details. Logic reworked for
initial location gathering which should now hopefully allow for the three tier system to

This provides an equation to determine a bounding radius of a given point, for example
a cirle 50 miles/kilometres around a given location.

The reasoning behind this is to allow these calcuations to be performed so external API's
such as the one offered by OpenCellID.org can be utilised to provide known CellID and tower
locations which could be enabled within MapView.

Preference change is now detected correctly by the application showing immediate changes to

this change is quite significant in terms of layout of the application source code and the
abilities provided by gradle.

Google Maps API v2 support added to enable use of new features and gain an API Key for the
application as API v1 keys are no longer available, signal strength data is now correctly
overlayed on the map as well. Minor tweaks are required but currently everything is functioning
correctly, the next items to add could include markers to identify tracked CellID's and user
options to modify map preferences.

Database export corrected and changed to use the OpenCV library to produce CSV copies of the database tables."

All AOSP specific items have been removed to allow for Universal Compatibility this includes the
AOSP frameworks and telephony class libraries and the OemHookRil class which implemented methods
that required the hidden SDK methods.

Functionality has been reduced to showing device information at present and will be extended once
methods are discovered to issue AT commands, tracking of Cell Info, Signal Strength and Location
are still available.

Settings have been added but need to be completed but the basic items are displayed.

Changes mean the application no longer needs to be signed using the AOSP platform key and functions
correctly as a user application and should also function on any device.

Femtocell Detection will be implemented full for CDMA devices in the next commit."

Service, Boot Completed Receiver, TableView & Femtocatcher Additions"
xLaMbChOpSx,2014-04-08 13:24:01,https://api.github.com/repos/CellularPrivacy/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/git/commits/8a040966ad9976196639b5fe4a9f42c4069aeb47,8a040966ad9976196639b5fe4a9f42c4069aeb47,"Service, Boot Completed Receiver, TableView & Femtocatcher Additions

Service has been added to the application and is bound to the main activity allowing for
persistent operation even when the activity itself is not active or has been killed, code
requires some further clean up and additions but currently functions as intended. This addition
resulted in the removal of the Device class I created with most functions now residing within
the service.

To allow the service to run once the device has booted a boot completed receiver has been added,
presently this will start the service without the option to disable this functionality but I will
add a settings preference fragment to allow user selection of this function. (Maybe default to
enabled and allow deactiviation?)

I really didn't like the old Textview display and code that powered the details screen shown by
the application so I replaced this with a TableView which hopefully make the app look a little
better.

Femtocatcher methods has been added and modified slightly (basically just to compile) but will be
futher extended and an alert system incorporated to allow action to be taken if connected to a
Femtocell. This code has been copied and modifed from https://github.com/iSECPartners/femtocatcher
with appropriate code comments as required. Further work is required on this in conjunction with
the RIL Raw work but combined will provide a valuable detection system.

The Femtocatcher methods presently only operate on CDMA devices as I have been unable to locate
information regarding the Unique ID ranges used by GSM femtocell's, any details that can be provided
regarding GSM femtocell unique ID values would greatly assist with extending this detection."

Added Persistant Notification which at present just displays the Phone Type (GSM/CDMA), but this
will eventually provide the immediate and visual notification of the phone status regarding
encryption/ciphering status and possibly Femtocell connections.

Added dialog to prompt to enable Location Services if Location Tracking is enabled but Location is not, settings fragment will be displayed to enable location services.

Cleaned up a little but of the code from my previous commit, coffee helps sharpen the mind a
little of this Windows developer and Android/Java moments of enlightenment can occur :)

Actionbar menu has been applied removing the old menu style and adding a more up to date solution
that can be easily extended and modified, resources added from the Android provided Actionbar
icon sets for graphical representation of the tracking of cell, signal and location.

Device class was rewritten as a non-static class which resulted in a number of changes being made
to other classes to take this into account, this should have really been the way I initially wrote
this class but oh well it is better now :)

Minimum Android SDK version reduced to SDK 9 - Gingerbread to target a wider range of devices,
a number of code changes were required to comply with the SDK 9 level requirements.

Further changes made to the ATRilHook class in an attempt to access the invokeOemRilRequestStrings method
correctly, also some updates made to the handling of OemRilRaw requests and their response. Method currently
displays the Ciphering Indicator provided through the SamsungServiceMode methods which unfortunately would
probably be specific to Samsung devices (testing required). Currently investigating the layout of the byte[]
layout to enable further access to these functions and a greater understanding of what the Raw request expects.

Mapviewer updated although an issue still exists when the location table is empty causing a NPE when trying to
overlay stored locations onto the Map, this is currently being worked on to correct this issue."

This commit takes the first small step forward for this project and includes a number
of changes which I will try and document below but some items may be forgotten.

* Package name updated for the project to: com.SecUpwN.AIMSICD

* Manifest updated and modifed to run sharing the system user process
  which allows for access to the phone process and main looper which enables
  execution of the OEM RIL commands.
  ***** IMPORTANT ***** This change requires the package to be signed using
  a platform key and installation as a system app, or priv-app (kk4.4+), to
  function correctly.

* Device functions moved into the Device class to provide all currently
  used device details and future additions.

* SQLite Database methods updated and expanded to produce three
  databases for each tracking method (Cell, Location & Signal Strength).

* Tracking methods updated to log each individual method correctly, and
  Cell tracking updated to capture only unique cell entities.

* XML Database Export added which will export all data into individual
  xml files.

* Framework & Telephony class files added to all access to hidden methods
  and initial dabblings with reflection added to begin the process of
  serial modem communication using RIL methods.

* Samsung Service Mode OEM Ciphering Indicator methods added which provide
  the Ciphering Indicator details through this method. (Only tested on GT-i9100)

* Code formats updated were possible to closer match the Android guidelines.

Possibly more..."
