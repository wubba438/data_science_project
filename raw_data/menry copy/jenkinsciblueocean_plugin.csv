The code attempted to make sure that only one ""Try BlueOcean"" action was shown butno one looked at the reason why multiple where shown.
The reason that multiple actions where shown was a bug in core that affected Queue.Items and their subclasses.  Given that almost all Queue.Items have no page of their own there is little point in creating an Action for them (and this solves the fact that they get persisted and then shown for a AbstractBuild.

In the case they are already persisted we just replace the action with an invisibleAction such that the only rendered ""Try Blue"" will be the one created afresh from the TransientActionFactory

Description
-----------

Files which are the same _name_ are not shown as artifacts in the Blue Ocean UI.

It is possible for multiple files of the same name to be collected but under
different artifact paths.  This change fixes a conflict of the unique ID field
where artifacts with the same name but different paths should have a unique ID.
By having a unique ID, all artifacts will be shown in the Blue Ocean UI.

Compare the following discrepencies of artifacts being listed in these two URLs.

- https://build.gimp.org/job/gimp/job/master/117/ (complete artifact list)
- https://build.gimp.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/gimp/detail/master/117/artifacts
  (incomplete artifact list)

> **Note:** `test-suite.log` is a file with the same name collected under
> different paths.

See also:

- [JENKINS-51533][JENKINS-51533] Blue Ocean Artifact tab not showing all
  artifacts.

Manual Test
-----------

Requirements:

* Docker
* Bash

Bootstrap Jenkins.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/gimp-ci-jenkins.git
cd gimp-ci-jenkins/
./jenkins_bootstrap.sh
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/` and after GIMP master is finished being
built, start another build of GIMP master.  The second build of GIMP
master is required so that GIMP generates unit tests.  By default
pipelines do not run unit tests for the first Jenkins build in order to
safely create all dependency artifacts.

Build the Blue Ocean plugin at this pull request commit and upload the
following artifacts to Jenkins:

- `blueocean-commons/target/blueocean-commons.hpi` (required by
  `blueocean-rest.hpi`)
- `blueocean-rest/target/blueocean-rest.hpi` (contains the fix)

* Remove expensive fallback path for expected build number and NPE
This changes fixes an issue I've seen come up:
    - When large numbers of triggers are run at once, the getBuilds call in getRun is extremely expensive.  It effectively ends up loading all the builds for a certain job.
    - This causes delays of sometimes several hours in scheduling jobs when load is high.
    - NPE when queued items can't be found in the queue.  This tends to happen more on startup.
The reason for removing this code is basically like this.  When a queue item that is blocked, waiting, etc. passes through here, the codepath appears to always return null.  This is becuase the queue item has not yet become a build and thus there is no entry in the job's build list.  The one I've found case where this does work is when the queue item leaves the queue (becomes a LeftItem).  At that point, it has been assigned a run number, and this code does work.  However, logically at that point this is no longer an expected build number.  It's an actual build number.  The regular build id logic in the blue ocean UI should take over at that point.

Now, it's entirely possible that I missed a crucial case here.  However, the getRun code is undoubtedly incorrect as it is extremely inefficient.

* Check for null job_run_queueId

* Check job event, if its running then simply return run id"

All SVG need to have focusable=""false"" otherwise IE may give them focus even if they are not anymore in the DOM and your document.activeElement becomes null and TAB_INDEX starts at top level (either document or browser(!)).

Can be seen in any creation flow. When using the keybaord to navigate in the create flow if you tab from an input field you get nothing and then tab again and you get the next element in the focus.

Basically you need to shift-tab or tab twice to move between the control elements when a statusIndicator is in between since it will ""steal"" the focus due the the svg not having focusable=""false"".

Happens in IE only, Edge is correct as is Chrome.

* [JENKINS-45703][JENKINS-45442] [JENKINS-45482] [JENKINS-45360] Several fixes around organizations (#1272)

* [JENKINS-45482] unit test showing incorrect behaviour.

If a custom blue ocean organisation is in use and it uses a root item
that is not Jenkins then modifying existing GitHub organistaions fails.

* [JENKINS-45442] unit test showing incorrect permission check.

When a custom organisation is in use pipeline creation checks
permissions on jenkins rather than the organistion root.

* Though shalt not set system properties in tests without restting them

* [JENKINS-45360] unit test for duplicate MBP with custom org.

Improve the test coverage and demonstrate the issue with MBP and custom
organizations.
shouldFailOnValidation4 is the test that fails in this case.

* Just increasing test coverage of custom orgs.

No issue was observed around this area but given I was working in the
area seemed logical to add it at the same time to prevent any
regreessions.

* [JENKINS-45422] the ACL check should be on the org folder.

The ACL check was checking the wrong ACL leading to a failure to create
pipelines when a custom organisation was in use.

* [JENKINS-45482] Use the correct Item.

When obraining the Item to see if it already exists the check used the
incorrect path if a custom Organisation was in use.

* [JENKINS-45360] check the organisation root not Jenkins for duplicates.

When we are checking for existing items we need to do it in the root of the organisation and not the root of Jenkins.

* Credentials uses an invalid org when no authentication in use

* [JENKINS-45703] - Check the organization from the url and the factory instead of jenkins root

* Adress comment.

* change version to steel

* [JENKINS-45703] Use better regex

* revert to normal snapshotting names

* Fixed a merge error and added apiUrl for cred creation as needed on

* JENKINS-37837# Provider specific authentication object handling

- Provided extension point for provider to decide their own way by which they can store authentication
  instance specific info in token and later on using the same cliams re-create the same authentication instance.
- Default implementation use in-memory store for each auth object

* Removed unused map

* Use putIfAbsent

* JENKINS-37837# Remove user check after token verification

There sin't need to check for existance of user. This gets automatically
taken care with token expiry or by jenkins subsystem.

* Use fetch to get i18n bundle - for it to work with JWT

* Only bleuocean-rest needed.

* Not needed to depend on blueocean-events

* Remove Java APIs from dashboard

We want dashboard to be composed with any java implementation. It should
avoid depending on any java specific backend implementation.

* Disable JWT for now

* Add api route only if not already added to avoid re-write

* Fixed urlconfig import

* [bs-poc] Implement fetching via the core fetch function instead the default sjax function from XHRBackend

* Turn on JWT token by default

Tested with default Jenkins authentication (with anonymous read) and
Github authentication/authorization sgtrategy. No regression noticed.

To turn off, set JVM set JVMP property
DBLUEOCEAN_FEATURE_JWT_AUTHENTICATION to false.

e.g. mvn hpi:run -DBLUEOCEAN_FEATURE_JWT_AUTHENTICATION=false

* JwtTokenVeriffier extension point to let others verify token

* ApiRoutable needs to honor its extension ordinals

* Abstracted away the mapping between ItemGroups and BlueOrganization

So far BlueOcean has assumed that there's only one org in Jenkins and
that's named 'jenkins', but this prevents others from defining different
mappings, like I'm trying to do right now.

This introduces an abstraction that the rest of BlueOcean can use to
map name to organization, then Item/ItemGroup/etc <-> BlueOrganization

* Allow the name to be changed by a subtype

* JWT sign and verify extension points

* Fix to comput node/step/log base url using organization

* Fixed tests

* Further improvement to JWT token signing

* Do not try and create our own ""session id"" when one exists in Jenkins.

* More JWT improvements

* Minor simplification

* This URL should be available for user w/o overall read access

Those users should still be able to get a token that represents them.

* This is not a JWT token, but rather just key ID

* Revisited abstractino around signing key selection

- JwtSigningKeyProvider is responsible for deciding which key is used to
  sign the token, then later translate back that ID to its public key in
  order for us to do validation.
- With that, JwkService no longer need to be an extension point since
  the newly introduced SigningPublicKey is sufficient.
- JwtToken shouldn't be an ExtensionPoint given that there will be a
  lot of instances of this. In comparision, @Extension is a marker for
  singleton.

* Oops, compilation problem!

* Doc improvements

* Support for JwtTokenServiceEndpoint

* Moved the token validation logic to servlet filter

... in order to:

- Clear out context at the end to avoid contaminating other requests
  that the thread will process later
- Pave way for SSE proxy to use JWT token for authentication, which is
  necessary for us to be able to proxy the request to masters.

* JWT service endpoint fetched from config

Released @jenkins-cd/blueocean-core-js@0.0.90-BSPOC4.

* Compilation fixes

* Wrong registration scheme

@Extension component is not instantiated until someone asks for it

* Implement JwtAuthenticationStore to avoid this work around.

* javadoc fix

* Set previous security context if there

* Use crepto secure token id

Also clears authentication instance if token is expired

* Updated blueocean-core-js

* Turn off JWT till fetching artifact and log start working

* Added blueocean-events to aggregator pom

This should pull in all sse dependencies correctly.

* blueocean-core-js release dance"

I just discovered hpi:assemble-dependencies, which is exactly what is
needed to bundle all plugins into a folder with can be used for the
Docker build. A dedicated module is also not needed at all (it was
required by hpi:bundle-plugins). It's a bit unfortunate to discover
this now, but better late than never..

Although matrix-auth and antisamy-markup-formatter are not needed to run
BlueOcean, it's good to have them around when the development image is
started with demo data."

The change to getActions() is unrelated to JENKINS-36074, but I needed
to fix that after pulling the latest changes in order to see the
getCommitId() fix working. I do not understand why an action would be

js-builder now looks for ""extDependencies"" in the ""jenkinscd"" section of the package.json and generates
adjunct js-module bundles for the dependencies specified in their. js-modules triggers async loading from
the same adjunct urls.

This all means that we no longer need to create HPIs for these bundles (or most of them anyway - can still
if we need to). Instead, each plugin will bundle its own dependencies. At runtime, if that dependency
has not already been loaded by another plugin, js-modules will trigger loading of the dep from the adjunct url.

js-builder generates the dep bundle such that it ends up being bundled in the HPI. So, multiple plugins may end up
having the same js bundles (generated by js-builder), but that's ok as we include the version number in the URL.
At the moment, we blank out the patch version, which means we always treat e.g. v3.2.1 as being compatible with
v3.2.9, but do not treat v3.2.1 and v3.3.1 as being compatible. Hope this makes sense."

 * More progress correcting missing / incorrect overrides in theme
 * Got everything pink in the bootstrap theme example at least.

TODO:

- [ ] Add a minify step for dist, update examples to use it
- [ ] Make sure package json has correct metadata showing the author as me, as well as somehow pointing out CB footed the bill
- [ ] Make sure “npm publish” or whatever will not do so without first doing a complete clean and build.
- [ ] Publish to npm
- [ ] Basic form components
- [ ] Pull the css reset into the one jenkins css file, which would then be minimised
- [ ] Clean out all the styles we’re not using from the css
- [ ] Extract static HTML from example into React Components for BO to depend on

If the identity that's making the HTTP call has a specific permission (in this case Jenkins.ADMINISTER = god access) in the eyes of the currently installed AuthorizationStrategy, then this check returns true.

We could have defined a new permission here if we wanted, but Jenkins.ADMINISTER is sufficient. AuthorizationStrategy allows any user to have the god access on himself/herself, so anyone can
read any information about himself.

What this allow you to do, in addition, is that for example when CJP RBAC plugin is in place, there can be ops team lead ""ben"" account that has ADMINISTER permission on every User object, and those decision making logic is decoupled from the application logic."

- Added ServiceException and added to java docs of apis
- ProfileService and PipelineService appears as ExtensionPoint to be
  implemented as @Extension
- Added Identity to abstract user Pricipal
- Convinience ServiceException classes created
- UserDetails gives LoginDetails of various providers

Passing user Identity to Service API implementations:
----------------------------------------------------

Current approach is to pass Identity as parameter of each and every API method.
Any future Service API must have Identity as parameter or things wont work as
expected.

We have it this way at present which is bit ugly and it definitely needs revist.
Once we have Guice based infrastructure in place  and we have code to prove how
it is going to work, these interfaces may change.

For example, an API implementation can always ask for instance of Identity via
Guice injection at the same time service client can call any service API and
inject identity with escalated privilege."
