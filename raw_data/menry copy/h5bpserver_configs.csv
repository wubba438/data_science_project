An Open Web App manifest file (having the extension `.webapp`):

* must be served with a `Content-Type` header of
  `application/x-web-app-manifest+json` (this is currently not enforced
  by Firefox but is enforced by the Firefox Marketplace while, Firefox
  OS only checks this if the origin of the page where the user triggers
  the install is different from the origin of the app itself)

* must be UTF-8 encoded in order to be submitted to the Firefox
  Marketplace

* should not be cached (the expires headers for the manifest are usually
  ignored by Firefox but, just to be sure):

  ""Webapps.jsm <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/apps/src/Webapps.jsm>
  sets INHIBIT_CACHING <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/base/public/nsIRequest.idl#141>
  when it downloads the manifest, which prevents Firefox from caching it
  so, in theory the Firefox app runtime won't take expires headers into
  consideration. However, INHIBIT_CACHING doesn't prevent the runtime
  from using an entry in the cache if it exists so, if you load the
  manifest yourself, f.e. to see what it looks like, while developing
  your app, Firefox might cache it, and Webapps.jsm might then get the
  cached version.
  ...
  Webapps.jsm is the implementation of the DOMApplicationRegistry that
  is responsible for managing app records, including their manifests""

                            ~ thanks to @mykmelez for the explanation ~

* is a JSON file so, it can be compressed (the manifest validator
  <https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/validator>, doesn't seem
  to mind)

* doesn't need any of the extra headers (e.g.:`Content-Security-Policy`,
  `X-UA-Compatible`, etc.)

The php directives have been included in the Apache hypertext access
file more as helpful information then to be used out of the box.

Nowadays, the use of the directives is highly dependent on the php
version and the way in witch php is integrated with Apache. This makes
them less usefull by default and just extra code to remove for both
the people that don't use php and the ones that do (especially a newer
version).

be enabled. However, use of Apache < 2.2 is no longer recommended.

introduce other dependencies to other modules like, for example,
`mod_version`).

The rule that made .htaccess restrict access to files (.log, .bak,
.sh, ...) was missing an escape sequence on its dot.

As a result, in addition filtering problematic files, it also filtered
some very valid urls. For example:

    mysite.com/blog        <- satisfies /.log$/ and gets filtered
    mysite.com/hit-refresh <- satisfies /.sh$/ and gets filtered

This change modifies .htacces so the dot is interpreted as a literal dot
character, avoiding those issues."

Don't think it makes sense to turn this off for a single worker and it's on by default.

The docs indicate that Nginx will use the best method based on the available methods

Keepalive of 5 seems very low - i've seen recommendations of 10-20

gzip_proxied was set twice

gzip_static should be off unless actually used

default is deprecated

server_name _; shouldn't be used

Shoudn't use expires in the server {} block - should be inside location {}

Extra root lines not needed

gzip_comp_level seems too low

gzip_min_length seems too high"

While Wikipedia would lead you to be believe one thing...

Well that's wrong.

It does work in the address bar, IE can also use an .ico file as an
<img src> in some cases. But it has to be served as image/x-icon
instead.
