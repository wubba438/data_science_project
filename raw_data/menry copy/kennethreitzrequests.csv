There was no way to determine what actual names were available outside
of looking at the source code. They were not listed in the documentation
or accessible through the interactive help.

In addition, doing `pydoc requests.status_codes` displayed some pretty
unhelpful information - the utf-8 encoding string was included in the
module name, there was no description, and internal variables used for
initialisation leaked into the module scope:

    DATA
        code = 511
        codes = <lookup 'status_codes'>
        title = 'network_authentication'
        titles = ('network_authentication_required', 'network_auth', ...

This change prevents the internal variables from leaking, adds a
docstring (which has the side-effect of correcting the module name), and
appends information on the allowed status code names to the docstring
when the module is initialised.

The improved module documentation is then used in the API documentation
to provide another easy reference to the complete list of status codes."

urllib3 closes the underlying connection when we call
urllib3.Response.close but does not release it back to the connection
pool. This can cause issues when users have a blocking connection pool
configured and connections are not readily returned to the pool.

Since the underlying connection is closed, we should be able to safely
return the connection to the connection pool, so to fix this issue we
merely need to not return after closing the response.

Closes gh-3461"

This way it handles the no-connections, no-exceptions case

exit by itself within 5 seconds of the context manager exit,
the accept will be interrupted.

Previously we checked that the `request` being sent was an instance of a
PreparedRequest. If a user somehow created a PreparedRequest using a different
Requests library instance, this check makes the request un-sendable.

(This happened recently - unbeknownst to me, my server was running an outdated
version of pip, vulnerable to this issue - pypa/pip#1489, which creates
multiple subdirectories (src/requests, src/requests/requests) when you rerun
pip install --target. So the PreparedRequest was being created in one version
of the library and compared against the other version of the library, and
throwing this exception, even though they were both PreparedRequest instances!)

It would probably be preferable to check the object's behavior (instead of
its type), but a PreparedRequest has a lot of behavior, and it wouldn't be
really feasible or allow us to provide a helpful error message to check all
of it here. Instead flip the conditional to guard against the user sending an
unprepared Request, which should still give us most of the benefits of the
better error message.

I only moved the code into a function, there was no actual change to
the code. I added a few tests to ensure we're doing things correctly.

The real point of me doing this is to make it easier to bring back
`strict_mode` functionality. For you requests youngsters in the crowd,
`strict_mode` followed the spec for redirects meaning the method
wouldn't change to a GET. The current code follows the browser
convention of changing the method to a GET when doing a 302 redirect.
However, lots of servers want you to follow the standards (the nerve!)
so I'd like to override the logic. Now that the method changing logic
is in `rebuild_method`, I can simply override that function instead of
overriding the entire `resolve_redirects` function as suggested by
kennethreitz/requests#1325"

kevinburke,2016-03-17 15:07:16,https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/git/commits/e94c812c2d02427e924b72adfa3572e911eba2ca,e94c812c2d02427e924b72adfa3572e911eba2ca,"Clarify that SSL verification is on by default

Generally if a kwarg is present it indicates that an option other than the
default is being specified. Putting `verify=True` in the first code sample
for SSL confused me, because it seemed to indicate that you had to specify
`verify=True` to get SSL verification. The opposite is true; SSL verification
is turned on by default and you have to specify `verify=False` to opt out of
SSL verification.

Updates the docs to make this more clear. Furthermore, connections to
https://kennethreitz.com currently time out instead of presenting an invalid
certificate, so I replaced this domain with https://requestb.in, which presents
the same error message as is currently there."

requests/auth: Handle an empty 'qop' attribute in an Authenticate challenge"
matt-jordan,2015-12-05 15:47:00,https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/git/commits/5c19d3e07b68145c7af9ad70dcaa2e48dd06b0b5,5c19d3e07b68145c7af9ad70dcaa2e48dd06b0b5,"requests/auth: Handle an empty 'qop' attribute in a Authenticate challenge

Some malfunctioning HTTP servers may return a qop directive with no token, as
opposed to correctly omitting the qop directive completely. For example:

header: WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm=""foobar_api_auth"", qop="""",
        nonce=""a12059eaaad0b86ece8f62f04cbafed6"", algorithm=""MD5"",
        stale=""false""

Prior to this patch, requests would respond with a 'None' Authorization header.
While the server is certainly incorrect, this patch updates requests to be
more tolerant to this kind of shenaniganry. If we receive an empty string for
the value of the qop attribute, we instead treat that as if the qop attribute
was simply not provided.

Closes #2916"

For non-chunked requests, the request is performed using the 'urlopen'
method that underlying uses buffering for the HTTP responses (for Python
2.7+ versions). For chunked requests though, the request is made via a
different code path and so the 'getresponse' method is called without
using buffering. So, the response is consumed per single byte via a
recv() call on the underlying socket.

This patch, fixes that issue to mimic the non-chucked request behavior."

As Cookie.SimpleCookie is in STL, should `morsel_to_cookie` check the type of `max-age`? On the other hand, if **max-age** can not be converted to float, it's illegal obviously."

When a PreparedRequests's cookie jar is not a RequestsCookieJar instance, it
will not have a ""copy"" method. By adding _copy_cookie_jar we can reliably copy
cookie jars so that we have an actual copy instead of the same instance on
different prepared requests.

This also updates the RequestsCookieJar.update logic to create copies of
cookies from the other jar.

When other libraries or tools add items to the meta_path, we need to preempt
some of their import hooks to be sure modules can be properly found. This also
prevents problems importing built-in modules on Python 2 where it will first
attempt to import something like:

    requests.packages.chardet.sys

By placing our VendorAlias first, the above will fail and then it will fall
back to trying to import sys directly instead.

The existing code counts the number of 401 responses in the num_401_calls
authenticator attribute. This is in place so as to ensure the necessary auth
header is sent, while avoiding infinite 401 loops (issue #547).

This commit makes num_401_calls an instance of threading.local() (previously
an integer), using num_401_calls.value as the counter.

It ensures that concurrent authentication requests get each their own counter
and behave as expected (otherwise every other concurrent request would have
its authentication fail)."

While discussion the issue, Donald Stufft (@dstufft) and I realized the
simplest solution is to simply add an alias per vendored dependency. The
resulting changes are simple and effective. It prevents the issue in
2.5.2 and 2.5.3 where the following would work:

    from requests.packages import webbrowser

This now appropriately raises an ImportError.

There exists a problem (maybe a bug?) in pip when using a locale like
`LC_ALL=C` (which is commonly used by CI environments and system
configuration tools such as Puppet), where the PKG-INFO file is decoded
using ascii, raising a UnicodeDecodeError when PKG-INFO contains
non-ASCII characters (such as the n-dash removed by this commit):

I'm not able to reproduce this by installing the package directly, only by
installing another package which depends on it (via `install_requires`).

The command I used was `LC_ALL=C /usr/bin/pip-3.2 install --upgrade ocflib`,
with ""pip 1.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (python 3.2)"" (which
is the packaged version for Debian 7).

Although this should probably be addressed ultimately in pip, replacing
this character in HISTORY is a pain-free and pragmatic way to help
developers and system administrators who may be stuck with old versions
of pip for many years to come."

The tests were broken because they used the u'...' Unicode literal
syntax which disappeared in Python 3.0 to 3.2.

We can work around this by conditionally defining a ""u"" function which
will produce a Unicode literal on Python 2.x. This is basically the
same approach as taken by the six library often used for writing
cross-version compatible code."

We officially support Python 2.6 to 3.3, but simplejson does not
support Python 3.1 or 3.2:

  https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/issues/66

Importing simplejson on Python 3.2 results in a SyntaxError because
simplejson uses the u'...' syntax (the syntax was not supported in
Python 3.0 to 3.2).

Support for loading simplejson instead of the stdlib json module was
added by #710:

  https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/pull/710

No mention was made of the lack of support for Python 3.2, but it was
mentioned that simplejson can be faster than the stdlib json module."

- The fix itself

os.path.expanduser can raise a KeyError when $HOME is not set and the
POSIX getpwuid() call fails, which can happen when running under a UID
which is not in /etc/passwd or when the password file cannot be read.

The upstream bug report http://bugs.python.org/issue20164 is unlikely to
be backported to Python 2.x even if fixed so this change handles
KeyError by skipping netrc authentication.

Based on RFC2617 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617), the value of
'qop-options' directive should be quoted with double quotes:

    qop-options
         This directive is optional, but is made so only for backward
         compatibility with RFC 2069 [6]; it SHOULD be used by all
         implementations compliant with this version of the Digest
         scheme. If present, it is a quoted string of one or more
         tokens indicating the ""quality of protection"" values supported by
         the server.  The value ""auth"" indicates authentication; the
         value ""auth-int"" indicates authentication with
         integrity protection; see the

curl comamnd-line tool also appends these quotes. You can see this
by `curl -v --digest --user user:passwd http://example.com/digest-auth`.
Unfortunately, some minor server-side implementations seem to be sensitive
on this difference."

When using Digest Authentication, the client resends the same request
after the server responds with the 401 ""Unauthorized"". However, when
doing streaming uploads, it gets stuck because the body data (a
file-like object) is already consumed at the initial request.

The patch fixes this by rewinding the file-like object before
resending the request."

`PreparedRequest.prepare_url` incorrectly applied IDNA encoding to the

all by the most trivial user + password combinations.

- Replaced usage of `urlparse` in `PreparedRequest.prepare_url` with

Fixes #649 and #1329 by making Session.headers a CaseInsensitiveDict,
and fixing the implementation of CID. Credit for the brilliant idea
to map `lowercased_key -> (cased_key, mapped_value)` goes to
@gazpachoking, thanks a bunch.

Changes from original implementation of CaseInsensitiveDict:

1.  CID is rewritten as a subclass of `collections.MutableMapping`.
2.  CID remembers the case of the last-set key, but `__setitem__`
    and `__delitem__` will handle keys without respect to case.
3.  CID returns the key case as remembered for the `keys`, `items`,
    and `__iter__` methods.
4.  Query operations (`__getitem__` and `__contains__`) are done in
    a case-insensitive manner: `cid['foo']` and `cid['FOO']` will
    return the same value.
5.  The constructor as well as `update` and `__eq__` have undefined
    behavior when given multiple keys that have the same `lower()`.
6.  The new method `lower_items` is like `iteritems`, but keys are
    all lowercased.
7.  CID raises `KeyError` for `__getitem__` as normal dicts do. The
    old implementation returned
6.  The `__repr__` now makes it obvious that it's not a normal dict.

See PR #1333 for the discussions that lead up to this implementation"

While debugging an issue I discovered requests was coming back with 200
response, when it really shouldn't have.  It turns out this happened for
two reasons: the jetty server running the app was rather lame and
didn't fail the request as a Bad Request, and httplib was happy to let
malformed data through and call it success.

It turns out httplib's strict flag controls this behavior of whether or
not to validate the status line.  The underlying urllib3 supports the
concept as well.  There was a bug there to that is now fixed upstream.

The last step is exposing this through requests.  This introduces a
supports_http0.9 flag to help control this behavior.  It defaults to
to True to preserve the current behavior.   Setting it to False will
allow the underlying HTTPConnection to validate the status line."

Since response objects for failures (4xx/5xx responses) evaluate to False
in a boolean context, any hook which returns such a failure response will
evaluate to False.

The way hooks were setup, any failure response resulting from a hook would
be ignored, and the initial response before it got processed by the hook
would be substituted in its place. This commit changes that logic to test
for None so that hooks that return failures can do so."

Previously, data, params, and files were encoded and stored in

the old, encoded variant overriding it."

This attempts to fix an issue where encoding of a string might fail when the
encoding is set to some unknown format. Here we attempt to catch the
LookupException and subsequently blindly encode the string one final time.
That is we call str() over response.content without specifying an encoding.
This may still fail in certain cases but does properly handle the case of #338
by returning the expected string."
