          <p>Image Text 2</p>

  ....

With this change it is possible to use the ""sub-html"" of the current element therefore you don't have to search a specific selector within the whole dom and without a unique identifier. 
Benefits: no unique identifier needed, caption is within the lightgallery selector, faster because you don't have to find the element within the whole DOM

Thx for the nice library!"
