The usual way of disabling syntactic font-lock by setting the second
element of `font-lock-defaults' also enables regular font-lock which
overrides any `face' properties.  While magit proper handles this by
using the `font-lock-face' property, we should avoid forcing this on
plugins (although the user might still do that by enabling a minor
mode which uses font-lock, e.g., whitespace-mode)."

When applying a hunk or a region of a hunk that is not the first hunk
from the file, the line number in the header for the new start
position will often be incorrect because it accounts for content of
the ignored hunk(s) from above.  This usually isn't problematic
because there is enough context for 'git apply' to locate the
appropriate spot, but, in some cases where the context is too
repetitive to identify the location, it can lead to incorrect staging.

Note that the problem here is simpler than the one that 'git add -p'
needs to solve because, due to Magit's restrictions on what makes a
valid selection, we know that the hunks are contiguous and from the
same file.

Change log entries are customarily unindented[1].  In
git-commit-mode, however, adaptive-fill-regexp picks up leading
asterisks ""* "" in change log entries, which are subsequently
interpreted as a fill prefix of 2 spaces.  Thus, entries like the
following:

* file: very long description...

are ""indented"" to column 2 when filled:

* file: very long
  description...

Instead of messing with adaptive-fill-mode, the simplest way to
avoid this fill-prefix by default (but still allow users to enforce
it by manually indenting the paragraph's 2nd line) is to enable
fill-indent-according-to-mode, as was recently done in Emacs'
python-mode for bug#36056[2].

In 839aaedad (magit-push-current-to-pushremote: Use literal ref as
refspec, 2019-04-29), we switched to using an explicit ref rather than
HEAD for the src part of the refpec to avoid a race condition.  The
description for the 'git push origin master' example in git-push's
manpage suggests that a destination of the same name is always chosen,
but this actually depends on the value of push.default.  As described
in the refspec section of that manpage, dropping the destination
behaves as 'git push origin' (i.e., pushing with no refspec).  So if
push.default is 'upstream', then 'git push origin REF' pushes to the
configured upstream of REF (falling back to the remote ref of the same
name).

Explicitly specify the destination to make this work with
'push.default=upstream' while still avoiding the race condition.
Specifying the destination is a conservative change because this is
how the to-pushremote push was done prior to 7fee4089f (Refactor
commands that can set the push-remote before their main task,
2019-03-29).

that unnecessary.

This breaks non-interactive uses of `magit-clone', but that command,
like most Magit commands, was never intended for non-interactive use.
`magit-clone-internal' can now be used non-interactively, which may
be desirable because that may also sets `remote.pushDefault', which

always used by default, even if that buffer isn't the current buffer,
now both variables default to only use those arguments if that is that
is visible in a window of the selected frame.  For direct commands I
am fairly sure this is less surprising.  For prefixes I was on the
fence.

Also see the newly added documentation."

This is the new `magit-mode-get-buffer', but the existing function has
an incompatible signature so we do this in two steps to give authors
time to adapt their code.  Eventually the old version will be removed,
the new renamed to reuse its name, and the temporary name becomes an
obsolete alias."

Unlike for the log and diff prefixes there is no refresh variant
of `magit-show-refs'.  In fact because this command only acts as a
prefix if it is invoked with a prefix argument (a feature that might
be unknown to the user) or when invoked from a refs buffer, it can
be considered to be the refresh variant.  Therefore it should always
use the arguments from the current buffer if it is a refs buffer."

Globally setting and saving the log arguments broke with the switch
to Transient.  This commit fixes that.

- Remove variables such as `magit-log-arguments'.  The continued use
  of these variables was what caused the breakage.  Usually Transient
  stores all saved argument values in the `transient-value' alist and
  retrieves them from there, but we continued to save them in these
  dedicated variables without preventing Transient from trying to
  retrieving them from `transient-value'.

- Completely remove the `magit-log-{set,save}-default-arguments'
  functions instead teach `transient-{set,save}' about the
  peculiarities of log arguments by implementing various transient
  methods.

- Unlike trivial transient prefix commands, `magit-log' can set
  arguments for many different buffers using different major-modes.
  Normally the set (but not saved) value is stored in the prefix
  object prototype.  This wouldn't work here because we now store
  a different value per major-mode.  To keep it simple we store the
  set values in the new `magit-log-default-arguments' property of
  the major-mode.

- History is still shared between repositories as well as major-modes.

- Use the same buffer-local variables to store the arguments for
  `magit-status-mode' buffers as for buffers whose major-mode derives
  from `magit-log-mode'.  I.e. remove `magit-log-section-file-args'."

That means that ""b u"" (`magit-branch.<branch>.merge/remote') can no
longer be used to set an upstream that doesn't exist.  This has the
potential of being a disruptive change, but I think it is the right
thing to do.  The user doesn't gain anything from having configured
an usable upstream compared to not having configured it at all.

Only push commands, mainly ""p u"" (`magit-push-to-upstream'), are
capable of configuring an upstream that doesn't exist yet.  They do
so by first attempting to create it (by pushing obviously) and only
if that succeeds do they configure the target as the upstream.

The problem is that the preferred, and now only, way of creating the
upstream might not be very discoverable.  On the other hand, it is
not completely unreasonable that the ""initial push"" is done by, well,
pushing.  But that assumes that the user thinks of it that way.  If
someone uses ""the upstream"" in a way that differs from the workflow
suggested in the ""The Two Remotes"" info node, then things might be
more confusing.

While other parts of Magit have to be able to deal with missing or
outright invalid upstreams and despite the discoverability issue, it
is probably a good idea to prevent users from configuring unusable
upstreams."

This command recently learned to set the upstream before fetching.
That was a mistake.  This command is all about fetching from some
remote, preferably the upstream remote; it does not matter what
branch is the upstream branch of the current branch.  ""The upstream""
is a (potentially remote) branch, not a remote (repository).

It is more important for this command to be able to fetch from ""the
upstream"" in as many cases as possible, than for it to know what the
upstream is based on the configuration of the current branch.

Therefore this command now falls back to fetching from the ""current
remote"" if ""the upstream"" is unknown or a local branch.  If there is
a single remote, then that always is the current remote, otherwise
if ""origin"" exists, then that is used."

Most callers of `magit-get-upstream-branch' only care about the
upstream if it can be resolved to a branch, but until now this
function defaulted to return some representation of the upstream
even when that is not possible.

The optional VERIFY argument was added to let callers declare that
they are only interested in resolved upstreams, but most callers
that should have been adjusted to use that argument were not.

This commit removes the VERIFY argument and replaces it with a LAX
argument, which has the opposite effect.  By default this function
now returns the resolved upstream or nil.

Additionally this function is changed to use ""git rev-parse --verify
--symbolic-full-name BRANCH@{upstream}"" to determine the resolved
upstream.  Previously it accessed the variables ""branch.<name>.remote""
and ""branch.<name>.merge"" and then tried to resolve that to a local or
remote-tracking branch itself.  The old approach resulted in incorrect
results in some edge cases.

The LAX argument is for callers such as the ""push to the configured
upstream even if that doesn't exist yet"" command, which cares about
configured but unsolvable upstreams.  These commands need further
work, but that will be done in other commits.  When LAX is non-nil,
then this function behaves exactly as it used to behave when VERIFY
was nil, including the bugs.

`magit-get-upstream-ref' now always returns the fully qualified and
resolved upstream or nil."

in the caller `magit-ref-ambiguous-p' itself, and that is what we are
doing going forward.

I have checked the other callers they are not affected or are unused,
making it okay to change the behavior.  `magit-ref-equal' is only used
by `magit-ref-eq', which is unused, while `magit-branch-delete' and
`magit--cherry-move' only call `magit-ref-ambiguous-p' with pure
refnames.

The ""b"" binding is the most fundamental of these commands and should
therefore not come last.  Many checkout+checkout commands correspond
to some create-only command; these pairs should be placed next to
each other.  Taken together this means that we need two rows for the
checkout commands.

This may look a bit wasteful when some suffixes are disabled and the
forge package is used:

Checkout                               Create                 Do
 b branch/revision    c new branch      n new branch           C configure...
 l local branch       S new spin-out    s new spin-off         m rename

But when all the suffixes is available then this even looks better:

When deleting a remote ref fails, we fall back to removing the local
remote-tracking ref because a common reason for the push to fail is
that the ref no longer exist on the remote.  But it may fail for other
reasons (e.g., can't connect to the remote or a non-zero exit of the
pre-receive hook), and we shouldn't remove the local tracking ref in
these cases.

One way to tighten the check would be to search the process buffer for
""unable to delete 'BRANCH': does not exist"".  (We'd need to search for
each ref with a tailored message because we wouldn't want to remove
the remote-tracking refs for multiple refs when the push failed
because one ref does not exist.)  This method relies on the message
being stable and wouldn't work for some users because that message is
marked for translation.

Instead reach out to the remote to get a list of its branches, and
check the ref against this list.  Doing so adds an expense, but it
seems like an acceptable one given that the check is performed only on
failure and that it replaces cases where the user would need to
manually call 'git fetch --prune REMOTE' to clean up otherwise.

Although not strictly necessary, narrow the check to the specific
error code that we expect to see for the ""no longer exists"" failure.
The exit code for a failed connection is different, so this avoids
trying to connect to the remote with magit-remote-list-branches when
the push already failed to connect.

Fixes #3650."

The diff transients gained --color-moved in 9d0e65ee (diff: Add basic

--color-moved-ws.  This option, particularly its mode

--color-moved is useful.

--color-moved-ws accepts a comma-separated list of modes, so we could
read these with magit-completing-read-multiple.  But there aren't
many (if any) useful combinations, so let's instead define the reader
with the more convenient magit-read-char-case."

Use git-rebase.el's git-rebase-current-line so that we don't have to

We may want to explore other ways of displaying the --rebase-merges
sequence because the single line display isn't ideal for showing the

The rebase actions all gather their information through the matches of
the git-rebase-line regexp.  This works fairly well right now; the one
hiccup is git-rebase-noop, which adds a trailing blank after the lines
it inserts so that it matches git-rebase-line.

But the possible rebase lines are going to get more complicated when
we add support for 'git rebase --rebase-merges' and for the break
keyword.  Instead of complicating the regexp and making each caller
deal with these details, introduce a new function
git-rebase-current-line that parses the line into a common structure
that callers can use.

overkill because we don't need any of the object-oriented features,

We narrow to the set of rebase lines when moving a line down because,

12f38035 (git-rebase-line regexp did not support spaces before pick
commands, 2017-06-25).  With the new git-rebase-line regexp, the
search matches a line in the commented instructions block, setting the
maximum bound too high.

A further complication is that, once we add support for
--rebase-merges, there will be blank lines and ""# Branch <label>""
comments among the rebase lines, so we can't just stop the first time
git-rebase-line-p is nil.

Another option would be to set the max bound based on a search for the
first line of the instructions block, but this isn't a good approach
because the ""# Rebase ..."" line is marked for translation."

want magit-wip-commit-index to call write-tree with the temporary
index.  (magit-wip-commit-worktree, on the other hand, overrides the
index with its own magit-with-temp-index call, so its behavior isn't
influenced by magit-reset-worktree's temporary index.)

Also, refresh after the checkout-index call.  Otherwise the changes
are initially listed as staged because, at the time of the
checkout-index call, the temporary index is in effect."

The optimal load/compile order is defined in ""lisp/Makefile"".

In lisp this is split across four places:

1. Libraries that are required by many other libraries are loaded
   in ""magit-code.el"".
2. Libraries that have to be loaded for ""magit.el"" are defined at
   the beginning of that file.
3. Other libraries that have to be loaded up-front (but may depend
   on ""magit.el"" being loaded) are loaded at the end of ""magit.el"".
4. Right after that an attempt is made to load ""magit-autoload.el"".
5. If that generated library cannot be found, then all remaining
   libraries are loaded up-front.  Autoloading them would be
   preferable, but since we cannot do that we have to load them
   to avoid all kinds of issues.

All libraries have to be loaded in one of these places.  Within
each place the libraries should be loaded in the same order as
in ""lisp/Makefile"".

This commit adds `require' forms for `magit-transient', `magit-wip',
and `magit-patch' and additionally fixes inconsistent ordering.

It is quite likely that a few libraries from (3) could be moved to
(5), but that is another issue."

The rational being that if you want to sign all you commits,
then you should set the variable `commit.gpgSign' instead.

This will be further improved by using a new ""variable with

  clones of this repository"" or ""in all repositories on this
  machine"".

  Before this commit it meant the former, but since the next commit
  will add a command that does the latter we now have to address this
  ambiguity.

* Rename `magit-gitignore-locally' to `magit-gitignore-in-gitdir'
  for consistency with the above rename and the commands to be added
  in the next commit.

* The new command names are unambiguous from a technical standpoint
  but the terms are not really suitable for the suffix descriptions.
  Use more verbose descriptions, including the file where the pattern
  will be saved.

* Flip the positions of the suffixes definitions because that works
  better with the commands to be added in the next commit.

* Improve the doc-strings.

* Use the same prompt when reading the file or pattern regardless of
  which variant is being used."

We already used ""--exclude"" before but had to stop doing so because
that argument wasn't added until Git v2.13.  See [1: 7d61fe4e5] for
the story until now.

The benefit of this approach is that this function does not *always*
fail to return something when using an old Git version.  The drawback
is that when using a new Git version, then it *often* does not return
something even though it theoretically could return what we wanted it
to return.

Going forward use two implementations.  The >=2.13 implementation does
what we want to happen and the <2.13 implementation makes a best effort.

`magit-rev-eq' used to call `magit-rev-verify' on each argument, which
returns the first line of `git rev-parse --verify'.  In the case of a
range A..B, the standard output spans multiple lines, with first line
being B's hash and the second being ""^A-hash"".  It also return with
exit status 128, but `magit-rev-verify' ignores that.

`magit-rev-eq' should only return t if A and B refer to the same
commit and a range never refers to any single commit, so we should
return nil in that case.  Do that by using `magit-commit-p' instead.

This fixes a regression in `magit-diff-type', which (beginning with
296f8dc7) falsely concluded that a diff buffer showed unstaged changes
when diffing a range where the right side resolves to the same commit
as HEAD."

Previously this used `magit-rev-parse-save', but that failed to
return nil if REV isn't a commit but a range A..B, because it used
`magit-git-string', which returns the first line of the output even
if the exit code is non-zero.

In that case the output would be something like:

Because many users put ""~/.emacs.d/"" under version-control but don't
customize `magit-repository-directory', that directory should not be
a member of `magit-repository-directories'.  Otherwise `magit-status'
would not fall through to either offering to initialize the current
directory as a repository (`magit-init' would have to be used) or to
read a repository using regular file-name completion (except with two
prefix arguments), and users have grown accustomed to these fallback
behaviors.

Also update the documentation about `magit-repository-directories'
and `magit-status'.  The documentation about the latter was rather
ambiguous until now.  We trade that for making it a bit scary instead.

This reverts commit 2dbccdaadb6c5a69ff79165b45d635effcb2f281.

It's better not to do this unless absolutely necessary. After the new
`magit' release has made it onto Melpa it can take hours until the new
`git-commit' release is available too.  During that time `magit' would
be uninstallable.

Usually it is not necessary to bump the `git-commit' dependency
because nothing in ""git-commit.el"" changed.  In those cases we don't
want `magit' to potentially become uninstallable for a while.  (Well,
we never do, but here we can avoid without losing anything.)

Added a note to the release playbook instead."

When a command like ""git rebase --continue"" used `EDITOR' to have the

received that way, then it goes on doing other things that may need to
lock the index.

We therefore cannot run `git-commit-post-finish-hook' after the commit
was created because otherwise there would be a race condition between
the subprocesses of ""git rebase"" and whatever git commands the hook
calls.  Blacklist commands known to keep going after committing.

is complete.

We do so by looping until ""HEAD"" points at another commit than it did
before the commit was initiated.  Once that is the case we run the

then we give up and don't run the hook."

message then `with-editor-post-finish-hook' is run. `magit-wip-commit'
may be a member of that hook.

Trying to commit to the wipref is unsafe when ""git rebase"" is running.
It may result in ""git rebase"" failing because we hold the index.look,
or committing failing because some child of ""git rebase"" does so.

Teach `magit-wip-maybe-add-commit-hook', which is responsible for
adding that function when appropriate, to not do so when the commit
was initiated by a command that calls a ""git"" command that does other
things after creating the commit."

The magit apply variants fail on binary files because they operate on
diff output that exists in the buffer, and that output isn't (and
shouldn't be) inserted with `git diff --binary'.  d0e04a14
(magit-reverse-files: do not attempt to reverse binary files,
2015-03-06) provided a more informative error message by checking for
staged binary files.  Teach magit-reverse-files to also check for
binary files when reversing files from revision and diff buffers.

For revision mode, note that we use `diff REV^..REV' rather than
`diff-index REV', but diff-index would be needed to match what the
revision buffer shows for merge and root commits.  However, using
diff-index isn't worth the added complexity.  In the case of a merge
commit, `diff REV^..REV' would still return the correct list of binary
files in the very rare case that a binary file shows up as a resolved
path in a revision buffer.  In the case of a root commit, we'd fail to
detect binary files, but this just means that we fall back to
displaying a less informative error message in the process buffer.

Strictly speaking it is possible to bisect with uncommitted changes,
provided these changes don't touch the same files as the commits that
are being bisected.  Otherwise checkout fails and an error is shown
in the status buffer.  However if the very first checkout fails due
to this, then the failure is silent and to avoid that we disallow
bisecting with uncommitted changes altogether.

Fixes #3604."

git-annex converts submodule gitdir files to symlinks.  As a result,
magit-toplevel doesn't discover the correct working tree when it's
called from .git/modules/NAME.  The main user-visible effect is that
magit-diff-while-committing shows empty diffs.

We could address this by adding a kludge to magit-toplevel, but that
would mean risking regressions in a tricky and core part of the magit
codebase to work around the peculiar behavior of a third-party
program.

However, this is similar to the problem that was solved in
439ed762 (Record the working tree for separated git directories,
2017-02-05).  We can piggyback on that solution by teaching
magit--record-separated-gitdir to resolve symlinked gitdirs. In the
worst case scenario, we incorrectly identify the gitdir.  Then
magit-toplevel, when called from the correct gitdir, simply wouldn't
find a corresponding entry in magit--separated-gitdirs, and we'd end
up where we are without this change.

Fixes #3599."

those things will get refactored at which point this new feature will

The old order and default visibility of these sections was chosen to
emphasize the commits the user is less aware of.  If you work on a
feature branch, then you naturally know that you have created commits
that haven't made it into ""master"" yet.  So that section was hidden by
default and placed after some other log sections.  On the other hand
you might not be aware that someone else has pushed additional work to
the public version of the feature branch (""@{push}"") or the upstream,
and those commits might be relevant to what you are currently doing.
So these sections were expanded by default and placed before other
log sections, maximizing the likelihood that you would notice.

In the past users have asked me to change this, but it took me until
now to get sufficiently annoyed by the behavior described above to
change it.  Now we maximize for usefulness.

The logs that are relevant more often than the others are placed first
and not hidden by default now.  It is still easy enough to notice that
there are new commits on relevant branches even when the respective
sections come later and are collapsed initially.  The logs of unpushed
commits should *normally* not get so long that they push the logs of
unpulled commits beyond the end of the window even when it is scrolled
to the top."

By default we insert either a log of commits that have not been pushed
to the upstream yet, or if there are no such commits, then a log of
recent commits.

Until now we used different section types and values for these
sections and instead used a kludge to treat those two sections as the
same section in some places.

The reason we did this was that we assumed that there would be places
where treating these sections as the same section would be wrong, and
that it would be better to explicitly handle them as the same section
in the places where we know that this should be done, instead of
undoing that in places where it shouldn't be done (and where we might
forget to do so).

As it turns out there is only one minor place where treating these
sections as the same section is a bit odd, while we failed to fully
implement the faking in some place where it would be needed.  The
section visibility was not always preserved and refreshing sometimes
jumped to a neighboring section.  There might have been other issues.

Now we use `unpushed' as the type and ""@{upstream}.."" as the value of
the ""Recent commits"" section, just like for the real ""Unmerged into
<upstream>"" section.

This obviously isn't correct, but currently the only downside is that,
""d d"" on ""Recent commits"" shows the empty diff off the zero unpushed
commits."

We do this for the same reason for which we used to force the use of
no prefix at all: in order to be able to correctly parse filenames in
diffs, we have to know whether a prefix is used and how long it is.

I probably chose ""--no-prefix"" in ebccd16914 to do so, because that
is only one argument.  Unfortunately Git in some cases ignores that
argument, namely when the ""-L"" argument is also used.

Forcing the use of the default prefixes instead should be safer
because it doesn't matter whether we get the desired output because
our request was honored or because the user's ""diff.noprefix=true""

As of helm's 1aca3e84 (Always use a sync handler when COLLECTION is a

Since GNU Emacs 26.1, specifically commit [1: 3988ceaa1c] addressing
bug#24409, dired-jump passes a non-nil FILE-NAME argument to
expand-file-name.  The expansion removes the trailing ""/.""  which
magit-dired-jump previously appended to directory name arguments,
resulting in a jump to the parent of the desired directory.

In place of the ""/."" approach of Magit commit [2: 5665ba94], call
file-name-as-directory when magit-file-at-point returns a directory.
This is necessary because magit-file-at-point returns a submodule path
without a trailing slash, and we want to jump to the submodule
directory not the parent directory.

In addition, simplify magit-dired-jump by passing a FILE-NAME argument
of nil to dired-jump when no file is detected at point, as dired-jump
will default to default-directory in this case.

Previously the required information was determined in one place and
then passed along to the place where it was needed.  More specifically
all values were determined within the commands' `interactive' form and
then used in `magit-blame--run'.  Additionally the code used to
collect the necessary information was interweaved with error detection.

Now the commands take no arguments at all and call `magit-blame--run'
with a single argument, TYPE, which essentially identifies them.

The task of visiting the appropriate blob in a buffer (when necessary)
and the task of adding blame information to that buffer are clearly
separated.  The commands now
* call `magit-blame--pre-blame-assert' to avoid trying to blame when
  that is not possible;
* call `magit-blame--pre-blame-setup' to visit the appropriate blob,
  if that is necessary, and to jump to the correct line; and
* call `magit-blame--run' to add the blame information to the buffer.

When the current buffer does not already contain blame information,
then `magit-blame--pre-blame-setup' does nothing.  If it needs to
visit a blob, then it delegates that to `magit-blame-visit-prev-file'.
When the ""blaming direction"" changes, then it clears existing
overlays."

I am considering it a failed experiment.  The hope was that Magit
users would stick around help each other.  But very few people beside
maintainers of Magit and related packages actually do help other users
more than once or twice.  Most users leave once they got their own
question answered.

I don't find it a rewarding experience to help users in the Gitter
chat.  Users who ask for help there tend to do less research on their
own than those who ask questions on the Emacs Stackexchange site.
That is one reason why I prefer the latter, it actively encourages
those in need to do their part.  Another major benefit is that by
helping someone there, one potentially helps many users.  Unlike the
Gitter chats, the QA sites are searchable and provide lasting value.

Therefore I am removing all the links to the Gitter chat and will
visit it less often, but I will keep it open, for the time being at
least."

* Drop support configuring the look using %-spec forms.  I don't

* Change how the commits are displayed that a branch is ahead and
  behind its upstream.  But these counts in between the two branches
  and use "">"" and ""<"" to indicate which branch has additional commits
  that the other has not (they both can have additional commits).
  Attach the count to the name of the branch that has the additional
  commits.  This also saves space.

* Likewise use ""<N"" in the first column instead of just ""N"" if a the
  branch in that row has additional commits compared to the focused
  commit.  The ""@"" or ""*"" indicating the focused branch, making it
  easier to understand the comparison: ""* <N BRANCH"".  If the branch

Since 4f7f55c93 we check whether the maintainer is allowed to push
to the fork and if so create a local branch whose name matches that
of the branch on the fork.

When the contributor did not bother to create a feature branch, then
that won't work, because in that case master (or whatever the default
branch is called) already exists.  Since the mentioned commit this
resulted in a (appropriate) error.

Continue to check whether we are allowed to push to the fork, but if
the branch name conflicts then never-the-less create a branch ""pr-N""
instead of attempting to create one named ""master"", just as if we were
not allowed to push to ""fork/master"".

Also set the upstream repository, usually ""origin"", as the push remote
even though we actually could push to ""fork/master"".  Git's push
remote mechanism only allows specifying the remote but the name of the
push-target branch on the remote is always the same as that of the
local branch). We cannot configure ""pr-N"" to be pushed to
""fork/master"" (Git doesn't support it) and we cannot push to
""fork/pr-N"" (we don't have the necessary permissions), so we configure
""origin"" as the push-remote and therefore push to ""origin/pr-N""."

When Magit is used with Tramp, read-file-name will return a path like
/ssh:host:/path/to/file.  The host part needs to be stripped before
passing the path to the host's git.  bf4332c8 fixed this issue for
magit-am-apply-{patches,maildir}.  This commit should take care of the
remaining places that call git with an unconverted read-file-name
result.

Follow the approach from bf4332c8 of converting a path at the time it
is passed to the git function rather than when it is returned by
read-file-name.  Note, however, that magit-file-rename is the only
function from bf4332c8 or this commit that makes use of the full
host:path, so it might make sense to add a function that wraps
(magit-read-file-name-convert (read-file-name ... )).

  context of modules, so avoid using it.  The command ""git submodule
  init"" does NOT ""initialize"" a module, it ""registers"" the module by
  recording its url in the super-projects $GIT_DIR/config.  This
  allows editing that url before actually ""initializing"" it using
  ""git submodule update"", in which case that command does not actually
  ""update"" but ""make available for the first time"".

* Rename `magit-submodule-setup'
      to `magit-submodule-populate'.
  Instead of ""b"" bind ""p"" in the popup.

  Git doesn't use the term ""setup"", I came up with that.  It is such
  a generic term that it could mean basically anything.  ""Populate""
  is much more obvious.

* Likewise change `magit--insert-modules-overview' to say that a
  module is ""unpopulated"" instead of saying it is ""uninitialized"".

* Rename `magit-submodule-deinit'
      to `magit-submodule-depopulate'.

  Given a sub-command ""init"" and another named ""deinit"", one would
  expect the latter to undo the effect of the former.  But then one
  would be wrong.  ""init"" only sets variables, while ""deinit"" only
  removes the working directory by replacing it with an empty
  directory. ""deinit"" is the opposite of ""update --init"", or as we
  call these actions ""unpopulate"" is the opposite of ""populate"".

* Rename `magit-submodule-sync'
      to `magit-submodule-synchronize'.

  Since none of the names of related commands contain an abbreviation
  it is nice if this one does not do so either.

* Display the actions in a single column and change the order a bit."

When attempting to invoke git-commit-prev-message or
git-commit-next-message in a buffer without comments, the functions
would fail with the message:

git-commit-prev-message: Search failed: ""^#""

Such a buffer could be the result of a prepare-commit-msg git hook
which does not emit any comment lines.

The rest of the code was already prepared to handle this scenario, so
just fix the re-search-forward invocation to not error when the regexp
was not found, and allow the caller to handle the failure."

Unfortunately doing so means changing the function signature in a way

because that argument was not provided or because an empty list was
provided as its value.  In the former case the action still has to be
confirmed in the latter case it does not because there is nothing to
act on.

So the `(items nil sitems)' argument has to be last but in d6420549c

For the time being I keep the binding in the modules popup, but that

Our `git-commit-flyspell-verify' does its job as intended, but that
only keeps flyspell from actually checking words inside comments,
it does not keep it from looking at each word in comments and from
incorrectly claiming that it is checking them.

That takes time and is confusing.  To avoid it, call `flyspell-region'

We cannot use `forward-comment' because that is syntax based, but
we cannot use syntax for comments because the comment character only

Change all commands which cherry-pick and revert commits to use the

used `magit-assert-one-parent' to deal with merges among the commits

removes it.

It is not possible to apply merges and non-merges at once, because
`--mainline' must be provided for merges while its use causes an error
for non-merges.  In that case aborting is the only choice.

But otherwise add or remove the `--mainline' as appropriate.  When
`--mainline' is added, then ask the user for the parent number, when
it is removed, then do so without prompting.  This makes it possible
for users to use `--mainline=1' (which is the most reasonable choice
for most merges) by default without getting an error when applying
non-merges.

Expanding a cherry-less section results in an empty body.  Normally,
during refresh, an empty body causes the section to be removed by
`magit-cancel-section' (in this case called by `magit-git-wash'), but
because inserting the body is delayed in this case (for performance
reasons) until it is expanded `magit-insert-section--current' is nil
at the time this happens, which causes `magit-cancel-section' to do
nothing.

That's actually what we want, but that wasn't by design.  However when
the user then refreshes the buffer, the section remains expanded and
because it is being recreated during a refresh `magit-cancel-section'
does its job.

Prevent that by binding `magit-insert-section--current' to nil while
calling `magit-git-wash'.

The fallthrough regexp is ""\\'\\(.+\\)"" as of
e0af5b39 (magit-ref-namespaces: improve regexps, 2017-11-15), but this
will always return nil, leading to an error when a refname doesn't
match any of the preceding regexps.  Replace ""\\'"" with ""\\`"", which
was presumably the intended change in e0af5b39."

Use ""git fetch --recurse-submodules -j N"" to fetch submodules.

Previously we used ""git submodule foreach 'git fetch || true'"",
because for older Git versions an error while fetching one module
caused the command to abort, so later modules were not fetched.
User of old Git versions can fix this regression by updating to a
reasonably new version.

Another consequence of this change is that fetching modules now also
fetches the super-repository.  Unfortunately ""git fetch"" cannot be
told not do that, but I think that's acceptable.

Starting with Git v2.8.0 start fetch multiple submodules in parallel.
That is the motivation for this change.  For older versions silently
fallback to fetch one by one.

Closes #3261."

anyway.

Because we don't do that and because we want to use the `magit-graph'

everything that doesn't already have a color.

Apparently nobody ever customized that face (otherwise this bug would
have been reported), so we could just remove it and stop colorizing
the graph stars along with the non-graph parts.

This commit is a compromise.  We just fallback to remove the face
later on for parts that should not use it.

Beside from the summary, we also remove it from the refs.  The latter
doesn't actually matter as far as users are concerned because here the
wrong face is later replaced by another.  But not removing the wrong
face first makes that task of adding the right face confusing.  I
noticed this bug while working on the respective code."

Previously we did make sure that the staged changes were being
displayed before ""toggling"" to showing the amend changes.  Likewise
we did not make sure that the amend changes were being displayed
before ""toggling"" to display the staged changes.

Now the first to cases of the `cond' take care of toggling.  If
neither case matches, then we use the same logic that is used when
the diff buffer does not exist.

Also remove the distinction between ""buffer exists and is visible""
and ""buffer exists but is not visible"".  The latter used some weird
logic that only made sense because `magit-commit-diff' did in some
cases not display the diff buffer upfront.  But since the previous
commit it always does.

Now we do this:
- If the most appropriate diff is not already being displayed,
  then display it.
- If the most appropriate diff is already being displayed,
  then toggle to the other."

toggling to the ""other diff"" if the diff buffer already exists.

tarsius,2017-10-30 11:25:10,https://api.github.com/repos/magit/magit/git/commits/115041d4b471228091c14b59bba6c91eb4d4c0f0,115041d4b471228091c14b59bba6c91eb4d4c0f0,"Support one-section magit-selections

For a long time Magit supported selecting two or more sibling sections
using the region and then acting on that selection instead of only on
the current section.  Single-section selections were not supported and
a region that did not span multiple siblings was not visualized as a
selection, instead the underlying region was visualized as it is in
non-magit buffers.

The change users will notice first is that when they press C-SPC to
set the beginning of the region/magit-selection on a section heading,
then the magit-selection is visualized.  Previously not even the
region was shown after just pressing C-SPC, because the mark and the
point were identical, so there was no non-empty region to visualize.

For the time being most commands continue to behave exactly as before
when there is a one-section selection: the act on the current section
instead.  While a one-section selection is a selection that contains
nothing but the current section, this difference between the current
section and a set consisting of only the current section is still
relevant.  It affects whether and how commands ask for confirmation
and/or offer the user to act on something else instead.

The reason I decided against supporting one-section selections in the
past is that it is a bit unfortunate to visualize the selection and
then the invoked command does not actually use it.  But this is no
different from a multi-section selection being visualized and then
invoking a command that isn't magit-selection aware at all.  Or from
having the region visualized in any Emacs buffer and then invoking any
command that doesn't behave differently when the region is active.

Beginning with this commit only a handful of commands begin using a
one-section selection.  Most importantly, and this is what motivated
this change, it is now possible to use `magit-branch-spinoff' after
selecting just HEAD to create a new branch rewinding the previously
current branch by a single commit.  Previously it was only possible
to rewind it to its upstream or to rewind it by at least two commits.

The other commands that respect one-section selections are:
- magit-am-apply-patches
- magit-cherry-apply
- magit-cherry-pick
- magit-revert
- magit-revert-no-commit
- magit-stash-drop
- magit-tag-delete

The recently added commands `magit-previous-line' and
`magit-next-line' now forgo moving on the first shift-selection move
when point is on a section heading, not just when inside a hunk body.

9cac1f53 changed magit-insert-local-branches to use the

use %(upstream:track) instead and manually strip the brackets.

Together with the ""git branch --format"" to ""git for-each-ref --format""
change in 2360d5b4, magit-insert-local-branches should now be
compatible with the minimum Git version that we support.

I've noticed is that the local refs do not include an entry for a
detached head.  At first glance, I don't see an issue with dropping
this because the buffer is about listing refs, and while there now no
longer is a line beginning with ""@"" when head is detached, the user
can still see in the header-line what commit the branches are being

Don't rely on the ""Commands:"" heading to detect the command section

the first command (i.e. ""p, pick"").  There's no guarantee that this
output is stable but (1) the same is true for all interactive rebase
help output and (2) this text has not changed since the introduction
of interactive rebase.  Also, don't assume that each command and its
description are separated by ""="" (e.g., ""p, pick = use commit"")
because some translations use a different separator.

The resulting output is a little odd in that it mixes English from
git-rebase-command-descriptions with Git's help in $LANG.  Another
option would be to force the entire rebase buffer to be in English by
setting LANG/LC_ALL (e.g., in magit-rebase-interactive-1).  Until we
decide that that's a direction we want to go, let's use this fix to
avoid displaying inaccurate bindings in rebase buffers with translated
text.

Fixes #3175."

Previously it expected a function that returns one end of the range
(the other end always being the current branch).  Callers used to
pass either `magit-get-push-branch' or `magit-get-upstream-ref' as
that argument.

These functions have the advantage of returning nil if the respective
branch is not configured or does not exist, which in turn meant that
we did not end up calling `git log ...' only to learn that that log
is empty and then having to cancel the respective section.

However calling these functions is much more expensive than calling
`git log ...' and then possibly having to cancel.

For `@{upstream}' this change is un-problematic because that always
refers to exactly one branch or no branch at all.  The meaning of
`@{push}' however is overloaded and can refer to multiple branches,
or an unintended branch (for our use).

As far as I can tell (see `gitrevisions(7)'), the only variable that
affects this is `push.default', so to make sure `@{push}' works as
expected we have to use `git -c push.default=current log ...'.

Because of this issue the respective module section headings used to
mention ""<push-remote>"" but now the mention ""@{push}"", like other
headings mention ""@{upstream}"".  In this context (""show the one and
only push target of the current branch""), we force `git' to use a
meaningful value.  In other contexts, e.g. `git push' with no
arguments, that would be dangerous.  Here it is not, and it is also
not misleading because Magit never does `git push' with no arguments.
(It is possible to do so, but users have to explicitly opt-in to that
dangerous behavior.)"

* When the user requests a bookmark for the current buffer and it’s in

  called.

* It will create a bookmark record using the default function, set its
  ‘filename’ property to the root of the current repository, ‘handler’
  to the corresponding ‘*-jump’ function, and various ‘magit-*’
  properties to parts of ‘magit-refresh-args’.

* When the bookmark is activated, it is passed to its recorded handler
  function, which feeds the saved ‘magit-*’ properties into the
  relevant Magit command and restores the position in buffer.

* The handler functions are marked autoload so that they pull us in
  when the user activates a bookmark even if neither ‘magit-bookmark.el’
  nor ‘magit.el’ have been loaded yet.

* Otherwise, we get loaded after both ‘magit.el’ and ‘bookmark.el’ are
  loaded, which is the necessary condition for the user to start

Every 'git-name-rev --refs=PATTERN' instance in Magit has the
intention of restricting the results to refs within a particular
namespace ('refs/heads/', 'refs/remotes/', and so on).  This approach
has false positives, though, because git-name-rev matches PATTERN
against any part of the ref name, not only the beginning.  magit-wip's
names are frequent offenders (e.g., 'refs/wip/wtree/refs/heads/').

9ab6d554 (magit-rev-name: anchor the ref pattern by default,
2017-06-20) eliminated these non-namespace matches by automatically
tacking on an '--exclude=*/PATTERN', but we reverted it in b8d55867
because the --exclude option wasn't added until Git v2.13.0.

Instead let's discard git-name-rev's choice if it includes the
namespace as a substring.  Because the substring match could result
from a namespace repeated in the name (e.g., a terribly named
'refs/heads/refs/heads/foo'), we only discard the name if the ref
doesn't exist in the namespace.

A downside of this approach is that there may be some other ref in the
namespace that could be used to describe the revision, but we don't
have access to it because git-name-rev returns only its top
choice.  (The --exclude approach didn't have this downside.)  In the
magit-wip context, though, this situation appears to be uncommon.
When some commit can be named either as 'master~N' or
'wip/wtree/refs/heads/master~M', N is usually (always?) smaller than M
due to the way that wip refs are structured, so Git will choose
'master~N'.

Unfortunately, we'll need to find another solution because the

back to Git v1.9.4.  As a result, magit-rev-name always returned nil
for pre-2.13.0 users.

magit-ref-ambiguous-p uses magit-ref-fullname to check if a ref is
ambiguous, but this results in some non-ambiguous names being
considered ambiguous because ""git rev-parse --symbolic-full-name""
doesn't handle names like master~1.

We had the same problem before the introduction of
magit-ref-ambiguous-p (7026b9bd) because we used magit-ref-fullname
directly to check whether a ref was ambiguous.  However, we only used
this in a couple of places, and it looks like the only problematic
case (i.e. where we passed a ref with a ^ or ~ suffix) was in
magit-get-shortname (which led to an unnecessary ""tags/"" prefix for
unambiguous tags).

As of 622c9941 (Merge branch 'km/show-ambig' [#3101], 2017-06-10), we
rely on the magit-ref-fullname check (through magit-ref-ambiguous-p)
more heavily, so the unnecessary disambiguation is more widespread and
annoying.

Instead of handling this in magit-ref-fullname, we could change
magit-ref-ambiguous-p to strip the suffix in the name before passing
it to magit-ref-fullname, but we handle it at this level to
future-proof against magit-ref-fullname callers that might pass a
revision with a suffix.

e.g. calling `mark-whole-buffer` in a file with a single line with a
trailing newline would call `git log -L0,1:file`, instead of the
expected `git log -L1,1:file`.

This fix changes `magit-log-buffer-file` to calculate `-L` as a range

Until now, we did not bother adding the default choice to the list of
all choices, because we assumed that doing so was not necessary.

But it turned out that while it is possible to use such a default by
simply confirming it, `completing-read' does not actually add the
default to the list of all choices.  It therefore won't be shown when
the user uses TAB to list the choices.  And when REQUIRE-MATCH is
non-nil, then the user also won't be able to exit after manually
typing the default.

Additionally `ivy-completing-read' was recently changed to completely
ignore a default that isn't a member of the choices, making a fix more
pressing.

This commit simply prepends the default to the list of choices, if it
is not a `member' yet.  Doing this is much simpler than adjusting each

be weird for the default to be listed first, when the other choices

All calls to magit-show-commit take the file restriction from
magit-diff-arguments.  But when a call is made from a log buffer, the
user is viewing the revision in the context of the log, so the log's
file restriction is more relevant than the diff's [*].

Adjust magit-show-commit calls to respect the log's file restriction
if the current buffer is a log buffer.  Leave calls to
magit-show-commit in git-rebase.el and magit-blame.el unchanged
because these aren't designed to be executed from a log buffer.

Closes #3056

[*] This patch assumes that all users would prefer the log's file
    restriction over the diff's in this situation, but of course we
    can add an option to revert to the previous behavior if this turns
    out not to be the case."

Git has no ""is it merged into something appropriate command"".
The closest it gets to that is `git branch -d BRANCH', which checks
whether BRANCH is merged either into its upstream or `HEAD'.

We depart from that and instead check whether BRANCH is merged into
the current branch, because it does not seem safe to assume that
commits that are reachable from the detached `HEAD' won't soon be
dangling if not referenced elsewhere.  Its possible to perform the
same check that `git branch -d' would perform by using ""HEAD"" as
TARGET.

Additionally this function supports checking whether BRANCH is merged
into any branch, by passing t as TARGET."

expect a commit buffer (in the default text-mode) to behave the same,

This makes the CONTENTS visibility state much more useful.  Now that
state shows nothing but headings, including the newly added pseudo
headings ""_ :ignored:"".  Previously the initial text belonging to a
section that also has subsections, was also visible in this state.

These ""_ :ignored:"" headers are not exported to `texinfo' -- that's
the ""pseudo"" part.  This filtering is implemented in the `ox-extra'
package, which is distributed with Org.  Visiting the Org source of
one of our manuals automatically enables this feature.

Unfortunately the filtering would result in duplicated menus being
inserted when using the `texinfo' exporter, so Kyle wrote an advice
for `org-export-ignore-headlines', which this commit places in
""magit-utils.el"".  Hopefully we will eventually be able to remove
this hack.  See #2914 to keep track of this."

One of the functions tried by completion-all-completions,
completion-pcm--all-completions, incorrectly reverses the
collection (Emacs bug#24676).  As a result, using identity for
display-sort-function doesn't actually preserve the order of the
collection.  We can't just use nreverse instead of identity for
display-sort-function because this incorrectly reverses the collection
when the buggy path of completion-pcm--all-completions is not
followed (e.g., for partial completions).

The fix proposed in the Emacs bug report has not been applied yet.
One option is to advise completion-pcm--all-completions, reversing its
output, but that would be difficult because we don't know whether the
function will follow the buggy path.  Even if we were to duplicate the
code to check that, we would need a way to detect when the commit
lands upstream so that we don't end up reversing the correct output.
Also, advising it could interfere with users or packages that have
made a similar fix.  Instead, let's copy completion-pcm--all-completions
to a new function, and override the original during our
completing-read calls.

Along with preserving the order with the default completion system,
this solves the issue with ivy-mode and crm.  helm-mode, on the other
hand, still sorts the collection according to helm-generic-sort-fn."

The ""*Completions*"" buffer for completing-read and for crm-driven
read-from-minibuffer defaults to alphabetically sorting the
collection.  As a result, any meaningful order given to the collection
(e.g., by the recently added magit-list-refs-sortby) won't be visible
to the user.

This is probably most problematic when reading a refname in a repo
with many numeric tags because these tags are displayed before
branches staring with letters even though tags (and especially the
older tags at the beginning of the list) are not likely to be the
desired target.  If the order of the collection is respected, this
problem is avoided because, by default, magit-list-refs returns refs
sorted by their full name, so branches (""refs/heads"") come before
tags (""refs/tags""), as well as remotes (""refs/remotes"") and GitHub
pull requests (""refs/pull"").

Preserve the order of the collection by using identity for the
display-sort-function metadata.  Unfortunately, the items are actually
displayed in reverse in some cases because a completion function,
completion-pcm--all-completions, reverses the collection's
order (Emacs bug#24676).  The next commit will add a kludge for this.

Many third-party completion packages preserve the order of the
collection without any intervention.  I tested completing-read and crm
completion with magit-completing-read-function set to
magit-ido-completing-read, helm--completing-read-default, and
ivy-completing-read.  These all appeared to work fine.

With the global modes for helm and ivy enabled, the order in the crm
completion list is not preserved.  In the case of ivy, this is due to
bug#24676.  For helm, this is because helm--completion-in-region uses
its own function to sort the output of completion-all-completions.

Closes #2925."

or macro may not be much of an improvement.  In upcoming commits,
however, we'll change the crm-related code a good amount to work
around some completion issues, and it would be cumbersome to add these
kludges in two places."

Add an option, magit-list-refs-sortby, that allows users to control
the order of refs returned by magit-list-refs and by the callers that
depend on it (magit-list-refnames, magit-list-branch-names, etc).

The most useful value for this option is probably ""-creatordate"".
Unlike ""-committerdate"" and ""-taggerdate"", this value works for both
commits and tags, enabling the ref to be sorted (most recent to
oldest) by the committer date if the ref is a commit or a lightweight
tag and by the tagger date if the ref is an annotated tag.

Relying on the ""--sort"" flag of ""git for-each-ref"" is somewhat
limited.  For example, a reasonable sorting pattern would be to order
by ref namespace and then by the committer or tagger date within the
namespace, but I don't think there's a way to accomplish this with
""--sort"" flags.  We could allow more complex sorting patterns by
returning a list of information for each ref and passing those fields
to an arbitrary user-specified function.  However, the added expense
of this is likely not worth it.

Closes #2872, but the next few commits will be necessary to preserve
the collection order with the default completing-read and crm
completion."

Extend magit-list-refs to take a format argument to allow the caller
to specify an arbitrary format, and then update magit-list-refnames to
use magit-list-refs underneath.  These two functions are currently
simple enough that this second step doesn't gain much in terms of
reducing duplication.  However, the next commit will extend
magit-list-refs to support a sorting argument, so having
magit-list-refnames build on magit-list-refs prevents us from having
to do that in two places.

Also, rename the ""args"" argument of magit-list-refnames to
""namespaces"", and restrict its callers to passing a string or a list
for this argument rather than supporting a &rest argument list.  This
change isn't necessary, but it results in consistent signatures
between the two functions.

Now that magit-list-refs takes a format argument, we should consider
removing magit-format-refs, which supports an arbitrary format
specification as well as some additional field-splitting logic.  It
was added in 3c4c28f4 (magit-format-refs: new function, 2015-01-27)
but has yet to be used anywhere."

VC adds a hook to auto-revert for files under Git that checks whether
the current file has a merge conflict and enables smerge-mode.  This
check grabs the index lock.  When a rebase is done, Git releases the
index lock in between each cherry-pick.  This gives auto-revert a
chance to steal the lock, which causes the next operation in the
rebase to fail.

The lock is grabbed by `git status --porcelain --' run in this
function.  We change it to use `git diff-files --name-status' instead,
which does not grab the lock.

Also see the preceding commit, which imported the unpatched upstream
implementation of this function.

hardcoded line to conform to general git log style.

This happens because `git commit` also inserts a newline (only if
--signoff is used) so in that case a redundant newline is created
(thanks tarsius for figuring this out!).

So improve the check before inserting the newline to not insert if
--signoff is used, but keep old behaviour when the flag is absent.

named HEAD.  This is consistent with how one refers to any
`variable' in a doc-string.

There are probably quite a few cases where we *don't* do that, feel
free do go looking for them.  This particular instance is being fixed

HEAD, when `HEAD' would have been correct in both cases."

magit-toplevel needs to determine the working tree from inside .git/
when a buffer is visiting COMMIT_EDITMSG or various other files.  To
do this, it uses the following logic:

 1) file is in .git/modules/<module>/: set working tree to the output
    of ""git rev-parse --show-toplevel""

 2) file is in .git/worktrees/<wtree>/: set working tree to the path
    in .git/worktrees/<wtree>/gitdir, minus the trailing ""/.git""

 3) file is in .git: set working tree to the parent directory

This, however, fails when a repository was set up by passing
--separate-git-dir to ""git init"" or ""git clone"", following step 3 to
return an unrelated parent directory [*].

The most visible consequence of magit-toplevel failing to return the
working tree for separated gitdirs was that an empty diff buffer was
displayed while committing (issue #2955).  9e0e2a24 (While committing,
diff from inside gitdir if necessary, 2017-01-17) worked around this
by introducing a defvar that could be let-bound to instruct
magit-toplevel to return the gitdir instead.  This resulted in the
diff buffer correctly showing staged changes because ""git diff
--cached"" works fine from the gitdir, but it broke
magit-diff-visit-file in these buffers (issue #2981) because the
default directory was the git directory rather than the top-level of
the working tree.  This approach also didn't consider other cases
where magit-toplevel would fail inside a separated gitdir, such as
running git-rebase-show-commit in a git-rebase-todo buffer.

Instead, let's record the worktree -> gitdir mapping of separated
repositories before the git call in magit-run-git-with-editor.  When
magit-toplevel is called from a gitdir file (COMMIT_EDITMSG,
MERGE_MSG, git-rebase-todo, ...), it can look for a working tree
associated with the current git directory.  If one isn't found, it can
take the parent directory as the working tree, as usual.  This comes
at a price of a magit-toplevel and magit-git-dir call during editing
commands, but it seems unlikely that any solution could avoid these
calls.

This should cover all cases where Magit throws users into a buffer
inside the git directory, making it unlikely that magit-toplevel uses
an invalid mapping.  A user would have to call a command that involves
magit-run-git-with-editor and then, before finishing that process, go
to another working tree that points to the same git directory and
again call a command that involves magit-run-git-with-editor.  And the
user would have had to set up these working trees outside of the ""git
worktree"" mechanism because magit-toplevel handles ""git worktree""
directories fine.

Fixes #2955.
Re: #2981.

[*] In Git version 2.8.4 and lower, core.worktree was set when
    --separate-git-dir was used, so ""git rev-parse
    --show-toplevel"" (step 1) would also work for separated git
    directories.  However, it turns out that Git was not intentionally
    setting core.worktree here:

As of d7fcc92e (magit-abbrev-length: handle auto-sized default length,
2016-12-01), magit-abbrev-length returns 0 when called within an empty
repository or outside of a repository.

Update magit-abbrev-length to instead return 7 for these edge cases.
This value is both compatible with the default length prior to Git
v2.11 and matches the auto-sized default length that Git v2.11
calculates for a fresh repository.

Whether magit-abbrev-length should return nil or a hard-coded value
when called outside of a repository is less clear, but returning a
hard-coded value has the advantage of not requiring additional steps
to determine whether we're in a repository.  And returning 7 when
outside of a repository is consistent with the return value of
magit-abbrev-length before d7fcc92e."

When committing inside such a repository `magit-commit-diff' is run
inside the gitdir, and there is no way to prevent that.  Luckily `git
diff' also works inside the gitdir, but because many other commands
don't, we always run everything in the working tree.

probably worth retaining them in order to be consistent with the ""git
reflog"" output and to avoid users being confused about why entries are
missing.

The functions `magit-get-upstream-branch' and `magit-get-push-branch'

because the default value of the existing first argument, BRANCH, was
defined using `cl-defun's (VAR INITFORM) format.  The value of the
INITFORM, which is (magit-get-current-branch), is only used when the
VAR isn't provided by the caller at all.  If the VAR is provided, but
`nil', then that provided value `nil' is used.

Previously it wouldn't have made much sense to use (FN nil), but now
it is reasonable to use (FN nil t) and expect the default to be used.
But actually one had to write (FN (magit-get-current-branch) t) until
before this commit.

But that clearly is very cumbersome, and so we stop using `cl-defun'
and instead, if necessary, determine the default value inside the body
of the affected functions.

For consistency, we do the same thing for `magit-get-upstream-ref',

Despite its name, magit-unstaged-files [1] lists both staged and
unstaged changes because it's based on a ""git diff-index HEAD"" call.
As a result, magit-repolist-column-dirty's last condition in 801cbfd8
is unreachable.  Use magit-modified-files instead, which is based on a
""git diff-files"" call and is restricted to files with unstaged
changes.

With the above issue fixed, the last condition can be reached, but the
return value for this condition is wrong.  Correct the
magit-staged-files call so that ""S"" is returned rather than passed as
an argument to magit-staged-files.

[1] magit-unstaged-files was added in 65867b5d (magit-unstaged-files:

teach `magit-define-popup' to use `magit-git-arguments' if GROUP isn't

Third-party hooks should not be defined as options, at least not when
they have a non-nil value, because otherwise an early `add-hook' would
not add to the hook but initialize it to just the added function.  But
users expect to be able to customize hooks, so we do it anyway.

Previously each `defcustom' form that defines a hook was preceded by a
form which made sure that the default functions got added to the hook
even when users added their own functions earlier.  Unfortunately, and
surprisingly long undiscovered, that had the side-effect of overriding
any customization made using the Custom interface.

Now we use an approach that works in both cases, obviously.

The comment added in d430d856 (magit-log-wash-rev: work around `git
reflog show' bug, 2016-12-01) states that the partial trailing line
""has no basis in the data stored in the file"".  However, as far as I
can tell, this partial line occurs if some reflog entries have been
expired (e.g., by 'git gc').  The reported hash on this partial line
seems to always correspond to the ""old hash"" field of the oldest
reflog entry.  That is, this hash is the first field of the first
entry in the corresponding .git/logs/refs/ file.

Update the comment to reflect this.

JќL is the name I have given to my (for now) personal key bindings,
which replace ""bpnf"" with ""jikl"" for navigation (similar to how vi
uses ""hjkl"", but non-modal).  Maintaining such changed key bindings
across all the packages I use has proven to be challenging to say the
least. Recently I have decided to try a new approach - just patch the
packages that I use.  That might seem like bad idea, and maybe it is,
but all the others didn't really scale either.  (And considering that
I have written a package manager, Epkg, that is supposed to help with
exactly this sort of thing, I ought to try that approach.)

However for Magit patching is not feasible, because I work on that all
the time, and sometimes when I work on a feature branch I do have to
restart Emacs.  I need my key bindings even when I am on a feature
branch and not by own personal key bindings branch.

Sometimes I add some optional functionality to Magit for the benefit
of a very small number of users, sometimes consisting of a single
user, who manages to convince me how very important a change is, even
though nobody else seems to have the same need.  Well, this time that
user is me."

Conceptually the default command of the refresh buffer is ""refresh

not make sense to bind ""L"" to that action because then ""L L"" would be
a no-opt.

But it would still be nice to make use of the ""double binding"" and
the obvious candidate for that is `magit-toggle-margin'.  Previously
""t"" was bound to that command, but ""L t"" is much less convenient than
""L L"".  Also using ""t"" for ""toggle"" wasn't a good idea in the first
place; ""m"" for ""margin"" would have been much better.  Especially
when considering that the next commit will add an additional toggle
command.

  is an addition.)

or at least that's what's being displayed in doc-strings, conceptually
the format is

  (INIT STYLE WIDTH DETAILS DETAILS-WIDTH)

The same format is used for a buffer-local variable
`magit-buffer-margin'.  Here the meaning of INIT changes to ENABLED.
This variable replaces `magit-show-margin', which said whether the
margin was enabled and several other variables, which were used to
cache values.  `magit-buffer-margin' on the other hand also caches
other information, which may be changed on a per-buffer basis.

`magit-set-buffer-margin' no longer calculates the width of the margin
itself, instead it uses WIDTH.  The option's WIDTH can be a function
whose value is then stored in `magit-buffer-margin's WIDTH.  For logs
this is always the new `magit-log-margin-width' function.  Due to the
mentioned forward compatibility this has to be exposed in the user
interface even though users should never change that for now.

There's still one hardcoded part: `magit-margin-option' returns the
option suitable for the current buffer based on a constant list.  But
that can easily be addressed when the need arises."

As of Git 2.11, the default abbreviation size is no longer hardcoded

To determine the default abbreviation size in a way that works under
the old and new system, use the length of ""git rev-parse --short HEAD"".
Unless core.abbrev is set, this will always be at least as large as
the auto-sized value.  In the cases where HEAD needs to be lengthened
for an unambiguous id, the size will be larger than the auto-sized

For each major-mode in whose buffers the log margin is supported add
an option `magit-*-margin', which can be customized independently of
the respective options of other modes.  `magit-log-margin-spec' used
to control some aspects of how the margin looks for all modes.

Remove the options,           adding options/variable:
`magit-duration-spec'      -> `magit--age-spec'
`magit-log-margin-spec'    ~> (all of the below:)

`magit-refs-show-margin'   -> `magit-refs-margin'

For each of the supported major-mode it is now possible to control:
- whether the margin is shown initially,
- whether the committer name is shown,
  (though in some modes that would currently just waste space)
- and how the time is presented.

Beside showing the age of a commit, it is now also possible to show
its actual author date.

Previously the margin ended with a pseudo-fringe, but only in log
buffers, because that looked worse in other buffers.  Now no such
pseudo-fringe is used anywhere now, because it is not possible to
draw it in the area of the window past the end of the buffer."

When magit-find-file and magit-find-file-other-window were introduced,
the value for the default-directory of the buffer corresponded to the
default-directory of the buffer from which the magit-find-file*
command was called.  As of e4ee279 (magit-find-{index,file}-noselect:
unify, 2016-06-22), default-directory is instead set to the file's
directory.  The new behavior has the advantage that the
default-directory is consistent for a file and doesn't depend on the
arbitrary detail of where the magit-find-file* command was called.
Also, subsequent commands that are sensitive to default-directory will
behave the same way for both a buffer visiting a revision and a buffer
visiting a file in the working tree.

It does, however, lead to problems if that directory doesn't exist in
the working tree, as many commands reasonably assume that
default-directory exists.  For example, calling dired-jump in a
revision file whose directory doesn't exist in the working tree will
signal a file-error.  Avoid these issues by using the top-level
directory if the subdirectory doesn't exist.

Support for this was removed from `ox-texinfo+.el'.

Our implementation differs from that old implementation in that it
patches the `man' link-type instead of the `texinfo' export back-end.

As a result links have to be changed from, e.g.:

  Also see [[info:gitman#git-diff]].

to

  Also see [[man#git-diff]].

Additionally we avoid the stray space that used to appear before the
period in exported formats.  So we now actually have to write, e.g.:

  Also see [[man#git-diff]]

The new exporter now inserts the period without a proceeding space.
Unfortunately it is not possible to tell it to *not* insert a period
at all when the link does not actually end a sentence.  Fortunately
there are not many such links in our manuals (and doing this is also
perfectly in line with texinfo's restrictive formatting of links)."

""make clean"" should do ""rm *.elc"" instead of ""rm $(ELCS)"" to ensure removing all
the .elc files, including those obsolete residue ones. Obsolete residue .elc
files are usually not included in $(ELCS) because $(ELCS) is computed from
$(ELS) by the following substitution rule:

  ELCS = $(ELS:.el=.elc)

while the obsolete source files are not in $(ELS).

A real life example is the residue file lisp/with-editor.elc. Apparently,
with-editor.el used to be part of Magit, but was moved out into a dependency
package. The old ""make clean"" wasn't able to delete the file ""with-editor.elc""
for the reason explained above. This caused the ""make"" command always used the

This builds upon the changes in [1: 4de3c98] which were added to
fix #2805.

Here we make sure that the buffer we try to use is still alive in more
cases and additionally we favor the process buffer over the command
buffer, because the latter is more likely to still be alive and all we
actually need is the appropriate value of `default-directory', which
is the same in both buffers.  Fixes #2832.

These complains about style issues in turn cause some users to complain.
I didn't change anything until now because I thought that users would
either appreciate the warnings or at least not mind them much, or else
they would just turn them off and be done with it.  But some complaining
seems to be necessary before or instead of just disabling the undesired
style check features.

Increase `git-commit-summary-max-length' from 50 to 68.  The old value
was chosen a long time ago by someone other than me after having read a
blog post that made the case for that limit.  I completely agree, that
this limit is far to restrictive.  Locally I set it to 64 a long time
ago and I regularly go over that limit by a few characters.

Add a new option `git-commit-style-convention-checks' to allow choosing
which violations cause `git-commit-check-style-conventions' to complain.
This adds a bit of indirection.  We could just have split that function
into two, but that would inconvenient those users who have already
removed it from `git-commit-finish-query-functions' and would then have
to remove the two functions (actually just one) again to accomplish the
same.

By default `git-commit-check-style-conventions continues to complain
about `non-empty-second-line'.  But it no longer complains about
`overlong-summary-line', because it's perfectly okay to occasionally go
over the limit by a few characters and the highlighting still makes the
user aware of that."

The git-rebase-todo buffer is frequently in a modified state, but there
is no need to save it before showing a commit.  It will be taken care of
by with-editor-return when the user exits through with-editor-finish.

The unsaved buffer should almost always be the git-rebase-todo because
the initial 'git rebase' call will fail if there are unstaged changes.
The user could unwisely go and modify some other tracked buffers after
starting a rebase, and this could put things into a bad state [1], but
this is unrelated to whether the user happened to call a command to show
a commit.

Closes #2770.

[1] And, when the user has done this, I don't think there is really any
    good action to take to fix the situation.  It's bad whether or not
    the buffer is saved.  The user should just never start an
    interactive rebase and then change buffers of tracked files before
    triggering the rebase with with-editor-finish."

`magit-stash-drop' process already logged the revision hash in the
*Messages* buffer to allow users who accidentally deleted a stash to
recover it.  Now we also call `git rev-parse STASH' before deleting
STASH.  That causes an additional entry in Magit's process buffer.
Deleting a stash then looks like this:

  0 git … rev-parse stash@{0}
  0 git … reflog delete --updateref --rewrite stash@{0}

Or after expanding:

  0 git … rev-parse stash@{0}
bc39d101554b2cfcb6b30f285ae6686e9695f429

  0 git … reflog delete --updateref --rewrite stash@{0}

There is no guarantee that a user who just accidentally deleted a stash,
will realize that s/he can get to the hash by expanding that section,
but it increases the odds of at least some users finding the hash.

A tag is just a name for a revision, so everywhere a revision can be
used a tag should also be fine.

The worst that can happen is that for some callers it would feel more
natural to use a hash than a tag, but after briefly inspecting all the
existing callers inside Magit, I don't think this is ever actually the
case.

On the other hand not returning the tag at point represented by a
section of type `tag' (as opposed to a section of type `commit' which
happens to be tagged) often meant that commands which are supposed to
default to the branch or commit at point instead defaulted to some
fallback default.

Ultimately all sections are inserted using `magit-insert-section',
which binds a few variables dynamically, to pass information to nested
invocations, among other things so that those invocations know what to
use as the parent section of the section that they are inserting.

Normally I avoid the use of dynamic bindings to pass around information,
but in this case it seems appropriate, because the ""nested""
`magit-insert-section' invocations often cannot be found lexically
inside the outer invocation, and the cost of passing these values around
as arguments would therefore be very high; a great many functions (which
shouldn't have to concern themselves with this particular implementation
detail) would need additional arguments.

Also the current approach works quite well, because normally the process
of inserting a section and its subsections is fully completed before
other, unrelated sections are inserted into another buffer.

However there is an exception which wasn't handled properly.  While
inserting sections in some buffer, it can become necessary to insert a
section into the process buffer.  This would for example be the case if
`magit-git-debug' is set to `t', and some section inserter runs git to
get a value but gets a non-zero exit status instead.  That normally is
not an error from Magit's perspective, but when `magit-git-debug' is
non-nil, then the error message is logged to the process buffer anyway.

In cases like this, outer bindings for `magit-section-insert--parent'
and `magit-section-insert--oldroot' are still in effect but we failed to
determine whether they are valid, which they are not because they are
about another section being inserted into another buffer.

Because process buffers are never refreshed (the refresh commands just
silently forgo doing so), this can be fixed easily, by binding these
variables to the appropriate values (`nil' or the buffer-local value of
`magit-root-section') around all calls to `magit-insert-section' which
insert a section into the process buffer.

We do not have to do the same for `magit-insert-section--current'
because the value is not used by `magit-insert-section'.  This variable
might be used in the BODY of the macro, but by the time that happens the
macro has already bound the variable to the correct value, overriding
and ignoring all bindings that might be in effect outside of the BODY.

This function is an alternative to

Do this by calling display-buffer-pop-up-window call and then swapping

to define a display-buffer-above-selected analog of

As mentioned in #2541, there are a lot of possible behaviors for
display-buffer functions.  Provide a few more options that users can try
before resorting to writing their own functions.

magit-display-buffer-same-window-except-diff-v1 and
magit-display-buffer-fullcolumn-most-v1 are modified from variants
proposed in #2541.  magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-v1 provides
the full-frame status behavior that seems to be popular (#1953).

The names of these functions are versioned, as suggested in #2541.

The helper function magit--display-buffer-fullframe is modified from a
function that Sebastian Wiesner shared in #1953."

it to do, is to perform a 3-way merge, just like when applying changes
to the index, but unfortunately that is not possible.

When reversing changes and when discarding staged changes while there
are unstaged changes, then use `--reject'.  This won't insert conflict
markers into files in the working tree, but it ensures that changes that
can be applied are applied even when there are other changes that cannot.

For changes that could not be applied `--reject' causes the creation of
diff files which contain those changes.  We would have liked for Git to
create conflict markers - using such ""conflict files"" is the closest we
can get to that."

Previously we used `git pull REMOTE BRANCH' and now we just use `git
pull REMOTE'.  This has the advantage that tags that point to commits
which are being pulled are also fetched.  Users have come to expect
that behavior.

We did not do this previously because I considered it to be unsafe.
The documentation of `git push [REMOTE]' claims that it pushes to the
upstream and fails to mention the various variables that can cause it
to push somewhere else.  The documentation of `git pull [REMOTE]' also
does not mention any such variables, but as the push documentation
demonstrates, this is no guarantee that there are none.  On the other
hand, unlike with pull, I am not actually aware of any such variables.

I have decided to drop the BRANCH argument because accidentally pulling
something different from what one wanted to pull, is much less dangerous
than accidentally pushing to the wrong place."

36be43d (use font-lock-flush instead of font-lock-ensure, 2015-08-15)
changed this to use font-lock-flush.  However, based on tests with a
somewhat recent build of the emacs-25 branch (cf79616) and on this
discussion [1], I don't think font-lock-flush will reliably highlight
the diff.  Also, the initial issue that 36be43d was addressing is, I
think, due to a bug in Emacs's font-lock-ensure (bug#22399) that has now
been fixed (21beb19, 2016-01-25).

Add command that runs a three-buffer Ediff on a file's state in
stash@{N}, stash@{N}^1, and stash@{N}^2, ignoring any untracked changes
in stash@{N}^3.

For choosing a file, this only focuses on files in stash@{N}^..stash@{N}
based on the reasoning that if a file was renamed in the stash, it will
be present in the merge commit stash@{N}.  Even if the file is renamed,
staged, and then deleted in the working tree before creating the stash,
it will be present in stash@{N}.  Likewise, for a file to be considered
renamed in stash@{N}, it must have been staged and will be in
stash@{N}^.

The old implementation was a hack, which got extended when I got myself
into a situation where the current version failed.  This time around it
was ""(not checked out)"" which was not handled properly.  Upon inspecting
`show_submodule_summary' in `submodules.c' it turned out that ""(revision
walker failed)"" also wasn't handled, and why there sometimes is a
trailing colon and sometimes not (there's a colon when commits follow,
so the colon cases should be handled separately even though that leads
to a bit of duplication).

At present, when `diff.submodule' is `log', then these are the lines we
have to look for.

    Submodule <module> contains untracked content
    Submodule <module> contains modified content
    Submodule <module> <from>...<to>:
    Submodule <module> <from>..<to>:
    Submodule <module> <from>..<to> (rewind):
    Submodule <module> <from>..<to> (submodule deleted)
    Submodule <module> <from>..<to> (not checked out)
    Submodule <module> <from>..<to> (new submodule)
    Submodule <module> <from>..<to> (commits not present)
    Submodule <module> <from>..<to> (revision walker failed)

This commit also changes how some of these variants are represented in
Magit.  Previously some information was lost in some cases.

When `diff.submodule' is `short', then there are no lines matching
""^Submodule"" and `magit-diff-wash-diff' takes care of washing it."

Don't just rely on the existence of 'mount' to determine whether we need
to handle cygwin style paths.  First, check that 'git --exec-path'
returns a non-Windows path, which is a much better indicator.  This way
we correctly handle the case where Git for Windows is used,
and (non-git) cygwin utilities are installed on the PATH.

to when that is called due to a file notification event or by a timer),
and `auto-revert-buffer-list-filter' is `nil', then it is let-bound to

If the buffer-local value of `magit-show-margin' is set, then call
`magit-set-buffer-margin' with its value as ENABLE value.

In [1: f77325e] I thought it would be enough to just forgo calling
`magit-set-buffer-margin' again with the default value of
`magit-{log,reflog}-show-margin', but that is only the case if the
buffer is still being displayed in the same window as before.  But
since margins are local to windows, we actually have to recreate
them when we might just have displayed the buffer in a new window.

Note that this only affects the selected window.  All other windows
which might be displaying the same buffer are not affected, but I've
decided that this is a feature.

Actually, since `git clone' always creates that symbolic-ref,
automatically *remove* that symbolic-ref right after cloning.

The default is to remove that symbolic-ref because it isn't actually
very useful.  Right after running `git clone' one knows which of the
remote branches is the ""remote HEAD"" without having to rely on that
symbolic-ref, because the local branch is automatically setup to use
that as upstream.  At all other times that symbolic-ref is unreliable
because it is not automatically updated then the ""remote HEAD"" changes.

But some users might want it anyway, so add a new option
`magit-clone-set-remote-head', which can be set to `t' to preserve the
symbolic-ref."

when the argument `--track' was replaced with the variable

to restore the `--track' argument in the popup, one now has to use a

By default Git only maintains reflogs for refs in certain namespaces.
To force it do so for other refs it was necessary to manually create the
appropriate file .git/logs/<ref> before calling `git update-ref'.  Since
v2.6.0 that command supports the `--create-reflog' argument, and we now
use it if available.

To make that easier, wrap `git update-ref' in the new function
`magit-update-ref', which also falls back to the old approach for older
Git versions.  Also remove the function `magit-reflog-enable', which is
where the hack used to be located.

This also fixes #2515.  The old hack failed when creating a stash in a
linked working tree when the repository did not already contain another
stash.  The problem was that a file .git/worktrees/<worktree>/logs/<ref>
was created, instead of .git/logs/<ref>.  Like the `--create-reflog'
argument, support for linked working trees was added in Git v2.6.0, so
it's okay to use the old ""touch file"" approach for older Git versions
(not that we have a choice anyway)."

is problematic when someone uses a command that is defined in a library

command which causes `magit' to be loaded.

To work around that, require `magit' in the body of such commands.

Replace the old magit-specific auto-revert implementation with the
mode `magit-auto-revert-mode', a globalized variant of the built-in
`auto-revert-mode'.  By default Magit still explicitly triggers the
reverts after running git for side-effects.  Automatic reverts are
still enabled by default, and Magit is less verbose about it.  The
behavior can be tuned using `magit-auto-revert-' and `auto-revert-'
options.

The main benefit of this change is that this implementation caches
whether a file is tracked or not.  The old implementation determined
this on every revert cycle, which did not perform well when there
were many open buffers and/or many tracked files."

Combine `magit-pull-popup' and `magit-fetch-popup' into one common
popup.  By default the old popups are still bound in `magit-mode-map'.

Add this to your init file to use the new popup:

  (with-eval-after-load 'magit-remote
    (define-key magit-mode-map ""f"" 'magit-pull-and-fetch-popup)
    (define-key magit-mode-map ""F"" nil))

One advantage of the new popup is that it is once more possible to
press the same key twice to fetch.  However that binding now is ""f f"",
not ""F F"", and it fetches all remotes not just the current remote.

The new popup also lacks the commands for fetching from only a single
remote.  You can add them to the new popup by adding something like this
to your init file:

  (with-eval-after-load 'magit-remote
    (magit-define-popup-action 'magit-pull-and-fetch-popup ?U
      'magit-get-upstream-branch
      'magit-fetch-from-upstream-remote ?F)
    (magit-define-popup-action 'magit-pull-and-fetch-popup ?P

      'magit-fetch-from-push-remote ?F))"

Previously the description contained ""@{push}"", which isn't precise.
What is being pushed by the respective command is configured using
either `branch.<name>.pushRemote' or `branch.pushDefault'.  So we
should use ""pushRemote"" as the shorthand.  If these variables are
set, then ""@{push}"" is usually based on their values, but when they
are unset, then ""@{push}"" might be defined anyway, based on other
variables.

""@{push}"" simply means ""where `git push' would push to"" (provided a
single branch is being pushed), and not ""the branch on the configured
push remote we would push to""."

Currently only the visibility of `file' sections is being cached.
Generalized the code used to do so to make it possible to use the
cache for other types too.

This is done by renaming the involved symbols and adding convenience
utilities.  Also `magit-section-show' now explicitly removes entries
from the cache.

Despite the names of the new functions, it's still only possible to
store the information that a section, which by default is expanded,
should be hidden when it reappears.  That might change eventually, so
that it becomes possible to remember that sections which are hidden by
default should be expanded when they reappear.  But we don't need that
currently.

Also note that this feature should only be used selectively, using it
for every section would not be good for performance."

repository (because it is the same for all branches) has the
disadvantage that changing that value becomes much more work.

In rare cases the push-remote of a branch might be different from that
of the other branches.  In that case `branch.<unicorn>.pushRemote'
should be set manually.  Whether `branch.autoSetupPush' exists or not,
doesn't matter, if the unicorn needs a different push-remote, then
`branch.<unicorn>.pushRemote' always has to be set explicitly."

Improve the popups `magit-fetch-popup', `magit-pull-popup',
`magit-push-popup' and `magit-rebase-popup', and their actions.

Each popup feature three actions which acts on the current branch and
the push-remote, the upstream, or any other source or target.  Some of
these popups also feature other actions and continue to do so.

If one of the mentioned actions isn't usable, because the branch it is
supposed to act on is not currently configured, then it is hidden.  If
such a command is invoked while it is unusable, then that now results
in a user-error.

The commands are renamed and the bindings are changed, both to increase
consistency among these popups and to be make them more self-explanatory.
Three of these commands were previously missing.

In Magit and the Git porcelain remote branches are often represented
using the form REMOTE/BRANCH.  However `git pull' and `git push' have
different semantics and that leaked into Magit too much.

Always use the REMOTE/BRANCH form and only convert right before calling
`git pull' and `git push':

  REMOTE/REMOTE-BRANCH-NAME
  => git pull REMOTE REMOTE-BRANCH-NAME

  LOCAL-BRANCH-NAME REMOTE/REMOTE-BRANCH-NAME
  => git push REMOTE LOCAL-BRANCH-NAME:refs/heads/REMOTE-BRANCH-NAME

The translation is done by the new function `magit-split-branch-name'.

Remove `magit-get-remote-branch', which returned (REMOTE . BRANCH).
We can now always use `magit-get-tracked-branch', which returns
REMOTE/BRANCH, or for a local branch just BRANCH.

Replace the two arguments REMOTE and REMOTE-BRANCH which a single
argument SOURCE or TARGET in many pulling and pushing commands."

Face attributes set in overlays always have a higher priority than the
corresponding text properties.  Magit highlights the current section
with an overlay whose face sets the background color, as a result all
text in the current section would lose its background color.

We used to fake negative priorities for such text which has a background
color, by using an overlay to set the face where one would usually use a
text property.  So instead of giving the highlighting overlay a negative
priority, i.e. one lower than the 1 priority of text properties (because
that's impossible) we instead gave the text properties a higher priority
(by using overlay properties instead).  Conceptually that was equivalent
to giving the highlighting overlay a negative priority.

But we should not have done that for three reasons:

- Giving ref labels (and a few other things) a background color caused
  the buffer to be much noisier than it otherwise would have been.  So
  at least in my opinion, giving labels a background color was not only
  a hack, and difficult and expensive, it was also undesirable.  In the
  v2.1.0 release I dropped the background color of all ref labels and a
  few other faces.  This was generally well received.

- Using overlays is inefficient, and should therefore be avoided when
  not necessary.  Every time Magit comes up Eli tells us about it.

- Using overlays complicates the code and makes necessary changes more
  difficult.

Dropping support for faked negative overlay priorities, might mean that
some third-party themes have to be adjusted.  Which is why I did not do
it in v2.1.0, but now the time has come."

Before checking whether a file is inside the repository for which
buffers are being refreshed, first check whether it is at least located
on the some host, using `file-remote-p'.  This optimization is necessary
because `file-in-directory-p' calls `file-truename' on both the file as
well as the directory, which, for remote files, requires a round trip to
the remote host(s).  (It would be better if `file-in-directory-p' itself
implemented that optimization, but for now we have to do it ourselves.)

4d035b5 (magit-toplevel: return correct wtree from within
.git/worktrees/ID, 2015-10-15) taught magit-toplevel to look in
.git/worktrees/<name>/gitdir to find the worktree path.  However,
magit-toplevel now also reads .git/gitdir if it exists, which contains
"".git"" rather than a linked worktree.  In this case, magit-toplevel
fails to identify the top-level despite being inside a repo.

These .git/gitdir files are created in a repo when a .git file specifies
a gitdir path that points to the repo.  They result from a bug [1] that
is present in at least the version 2.6.2 release and that was likely
introduced in version 2.5.2.

Add a check to prevent this file from being processed as a worktree
gitdir file.

The problem this avoids is that while cygwin does mostly support win32
paths as well, when git clone does the equivalent of ""mkdir -p
c:/tmp/magit"" it splits by slash and makes each of ""c:"", ""c:/tmp"", and
""c:/tmp/magit"".  Under cygwin, creating ""c:"" means making a directory
called ""c"" (cygwin uses a special unicode encoding for characters that
would otherwise be illegal for Windows filesystems) in the current
directory.  Therefore we must convert to a cygwin path to avoid this
extra directory being created."

If default-directory is used to check for an existing buffer, an
inappropriate magit buffer may be returned if its default-directory is
let-bound.  This is a similar problem as discussed in #2054 and #2060.
01cf031 (don’t bind default-directory to pass topdir to
magit-mode-setup, 2015-07-13) changed magit-status-internal to bind
magit-mode-setup--topdir instead of default-directory.  This fixes the
corner case with C-u C-u magit-status, but can still fail on third-party
code that let-binds default-directory.

One example of this is switching projectile projects with projectile-vc
as the action.  To switch to a new project, default-directory is
let-bound to the new project's root and then projectile-vc calls
magit-status-internal.  But if this is done from a status buffer that
doesn't belong to the new project, magit-mode-get-buffer mistakenly
thinks the current status buffer belongs to that new project and updates
it with the status of the new project.

To avoid this, add a new buffer-local variable,
magit--default-directory, and set it to the value of default-directory
when the buffer is created.  This makes the magit-mode-setup--topdir
variable (now called magit-mode-get-buffer--topdir) unnecessary."

  2. run setup hook

I considered removing `magit-mode-setup-hook' completely because given
the above order of events it is not necessary, one could just use
`magit-mode-hook' or a more specific `magit-{*}-mode-hook'.

But it turns out we actually need a hook that runs after displaying the
buffer (see next commit).  So change the order to

  3. turn on mode
  1. display buffer
  2. run setup hook
  4. refresh buffer

By the way, it would be preferable if we could use this order

  3. turn on mode
  1. display buffer
  4. refresh buffer
  2. run setup hook

but that is currently not possible because some section inserters only
work properly if the buffer the insert into, is being displayed in a
window.  Also note that `magit-display-buffer' has to run outside any
`with-current-buffer' or `safe-current-buffer' forms.

Also define `magit-mode-setup-hook' as an option instead of as an
undocumented variable.

We already did not use `magit-mode-setup' in order to avoid unnecessary
work every time a process is run for side-effects and because that would
run `magit-mode-hook' which by default results in git being run, which
could have lead to an error (see below).

Now `magit-process-buffer' also finds or else creates the buffer itself,
instead of using `magit-mode-get-buffer-create' for that purpose.

If `default-directory' isn't inside a repository, then it walks up the
directory until it finds ""the"" root directory (usually ""/"", but when
using Tramp or MS Windows, then something else), and finds or creates
the buffer for that directory.  Even if the root directory isn't also
the toplevel of a repository (which it seldom is) it is never-the-less
used in the buffer name, e.g. *magit-process: /*, and as the
`default-directory' of that buffer.

Previously when this function was called for the first time with a
`default-directory' that isn't located inside a repository, then a
buffer *magit-process: -* was create and the `default-directory' which
was current when this function was called was used as the buffer-local
value.  That value was never changed, which was a problem if that
directory was ever deleted (e.g. the `magit-mode-hook' issue mentioned
above)."

Use low-level `display-buffer' instead of high-level buffer switching
functions.  In combination with other changes described below, this
gives users complete control over how buffers are to be displayed,
without having to fight against hard-coded defaults.

Instead of hard-coding the rules that govern how windows are selected to
display certain buffers, define them in one place.  The existing rules
are collected in the new function `magit-display-buffer-traditional'.

That function is the default value of the new option
`magit-display-buffer-function', which specifies the function used by
`magit-display-buffer' to actually display the buffer.

All Magit buffers are displayed using `magit-display-buffer', which is
called by `magit-mode-setup' and `magit-process-buffer'.  Together these
two functions are responsible for the creation of each and every Magit
buffer.  `magit-display-buffer' should never called directly by anything
else. (Popup buffers are not Magit buffers, their major-mode does not
derived from `magit-mode'.)

Unlike `display-buffer', `magit-display-buffer' also selects the window,
unless the new variable `magit-display-buffer-noselect' is let-bound to
a non-nil value.  This variable is only intended for special cases.

Two options, and therefore quick ways of customizing the behavior, fall
victim to this change: `magit-status-buffer-switch-function' and
`magit-diff-switch-buffer-function'.  We cannot preserve these options
and use them in `magit-display-buffer-traditional' because they were
used to specify arbitrary high-level buffer switching functions, which
we cannot simply map to low-level display actions."

Instead `magit-refresh-buffer' determines the name of the refresh

then it is used to refresh the buffer, otherwise the buffer is not

This is possible because the names of all refreshers consistently follow
this naming schema.  Not passing the value around has the advantage that
the code gets simpler and it also helps enforcing this convention.

Add the `-n' argument to the `magit-log-popup' and add ""-n256"" to the

`magit-log-cutoff-length'.

This will lead to invalid reports about a performance regression in the
log buffer.  But what actually happened is that the user customized the
global value of `magit-log-arguments' and that value did not get updated
when the default values was changed.  Instruct users to add ""-n256"" to
the customized value.

This change is motivated by the drastic difference in showing a log with
and without diffs.  It should therefore be possible to quickly increase
and decrease the number of shown commits, without having to customize a
variable manually (i.e. not from the popup or using a dedicated
command).

Also add new the commands `magit-log-toggle-commit-limit',
`magit-log-double-commit-limit', and `magit-log-half-commit-limit' to
make this even easier, and replacing `magit-log-show-more-commits'.

When calling `git rev-list' to determine the number of commits, so that
`git log --graph' can later be called with a limited range to avoid
needlessly calculating the graph for the complete history, use all the
specified arguments.  Otherwise we might end up limiting the history too
much.

When certain arguments are used, that would actually double the time it
takes to determine the commits to be shown (because we would be doing it
twice), which by far outweighs what we gain from avoiding to needlessly
calculate the complete graph.

Add new variable `magit-log-disable-graph-hack-args' which lists these
arguments and consult it in `magit-log-refresh-buffer' when determining
whether the hack should be used or not.

By default, Cygwin and MSYS2 executables attempt to expand globs when

globbing when, for instance, using Cygwin's grep from the Windows

However, this causes problems when calling the Cygwin or MSYS2 git from

behavior and, when present, add ""noglob"" to the ""CYGWIN"" and ""MSYS""
environment variables to disable it.

If the diff arguments aren't passed, the return value of
magit-diff-arguments is unintentionally affected in future calls.  For
example, even if the magit-diff-arguments return value included --stat
before the commit, a revision buffer created after a magit-commit-diff
call will not have a diffstat section (assuming the diff buffer is still
around and the arguments haven't been explicitly changed since the
commit).

Drop file restrictions so that the commit diff always shows the full set
of changes.  The act of committing probably shouldn't reset file
restrictions that would otherwise be carried over between non-commit
diff calls, but this was already the situation before this change, and
it seems better than limiting the commit diff to a set a files from a
previous diff, which is unlikely to be what the user intended."

Bind ""i"" instead of ""e"" to `magit-rebase-[i]nteractive'.
Bind ""e"" instead of ""s"" to `magit-rebase-[e]dit-commit'.

Such changes are often not well received, so here we go:

Back in the days before I even used Magit, ""r"" was bound to a primitive
rebase command and ""e"" was bound to a primitive interactive rebase
command, probably ""i"" was already used for something else.  Eventually I
improved these rebase variants and added additional variants, all of
which are usually being invoked from the new rebase popup.  Both ""r"" and
""e"" were bound to the popup command to make the transition easier.

So it was possible to press ""rr"" to start a non-interactive rebase and
""ee"" for an interactive rebase (of course ""er"" and ""re"" would have
worked too).  But then some new, unrelated commands were added and we
needed to find keys that could be bound to those.  That's how the rebase
popup lost the privilege of being the only command which has two
top-level bindings, and only ""r"" remained.

Inside the popup we kept ""e"" bound to the interactive rebase variant,
because, as you are probably aware of if you read this, changing key
bindings lets muscle memory go to waste and some people find that very
disturbing.

But because in this case maintaining the old bindings leads to many
inconsistencies, I have decided to fix it now - the complains will pass.

""interactive"" begins with ""i"" not ""e"".  The rebase popup also features
an ""--interactive"" switch in addition to the ""interactive"" command (this
switch allows turning the non-interactive actions into interactive
actions, which can be useful in some cases).  That switch's binding is
""-i"" not ""-e"".  The popup also features a ""edit only this particular
commit"" variant `magit-rebase-[e]dit-commit' which originally ""s"" was
bound to because ""e"" was taken (cannot remember why ""s"", probably
because it is used to change a [s]ingle commit).  That command was
invoked using ""rs"" and was a shorthand for ""ree"".  The ""s"" and ""e"" serve
the same purpose here so they should be the same key, and after this
change they are: ""re"" and ""rie""."

need to be able to specify whether `-m' is should be used or not, and
whether any other arguments should be used.

Add a new argument ARG to `magit-with-temp-index' as well as to
`magit-commit-worktree'.  In both cases this can be a single argument or
a list of arguments (but we don't need that currently).  Then adjust the
users.

When creating a stash `magit-stash-create' uses `magit-with-temp-index'
twice.  In one case the TREE is nil, so ARG is irrelevant and we pass
nil for that too.  In the other case we pass `-m' to avoid the slowdown
and also because we want to error out if there is a conflict.

When creating a wip commit `magit-wip-commit-index' now passes `--reset'
to `magit-with-temp-index' to avoid the slowdown and to add the conflict
to the index, pretending it was resolved.  If there is a conflict then
it is staged including the conflict markers.  This actually is what we
want, we want to save the current state of the *file* (not the index),
including possibly partially resolved conflicts.

In `magit-sequence-insert-sequence' a dummy commit is created using
`magit-commit-worktree'.  It is used to figure out whether the changes
introduced by the stopped at commit still exists in the worktree.  Here
we use `--reset' to avoid the slowdown and in case there are conflicts
any errors.

`git log --graph --max-count=N' calculates the graph for the complete

`git log --graph HEAD~N..HEAD' only calculates the graph for
HEAD~N..HEAD but the graph is not the same; commits that are reachable
from HEAD but do not descend from HEAD~N will appear as root commits.

Address this by using `--max-count' and REV~M..REV to together when
possible.  More precisely do so when showing the log for a single rev
in the log buffer.  M is usually twice as large as N but at least 1024,
which greatly reduces the risk of the graphs for REV~M..REV and REV to
differ.

In the status buffer also limit the range for the log section inserted
by `magit-insert-recent-commits', but without avoiding that non-root
commits appear as root commits (because that happens for the sections

This fixes #2197.  We don't actually want to show the buffer belonging
to another client, so we call `server-done' instead of `server-edit'.
The latter calls the former and then also tries to select a buffer,
using `server-switch-buffer' which favors buffers belonging to another
client.  This does matter when Emacs was started in daemon mode and the
user connects to the instance using the emacsclient and then uses Magit
to invoke.  When s/he then completes the commit, then their always is
another client, the one used to connect to the instance in the first
place.

Later in `with-editor-return' we restore the window configuration from
before `with-editor' was used, so one would think that needlessly
showing another buffer before restoring the window configuration would
not matter.  However the previous window configuration has to be
explicitly stored by the caller of `with-editor', so we cannot rely on
a configuration being stored and have to fix the above issue anyway.

In the case of committing using Magit this should not have made a
difference because that does save the previous window configuration, but
unfortunately it does it to late, when the configuration has already
been modified somewhat.  I am not sure if that can be fixed, but in any
case that's a different issue."

Make sure that default-directory stays set at the top-level directory.
When magit-blame is called from an indirect buffer, the find-file call
sets default-directory to the file's directory, so the downstream git
call (now from the file's directory) fails when given a path relative to
the top-level directory.

This isn't an issue when magit-blame is called from a buffer visiting a
file.  The call to find-file does not override the default-directory
let-bound by magit-with-toplevel because the file is already being
visited by the current buffer.

Fix this by let-binding the find-file call separately.

While this makes it possible call magit-blame from an indirect buffer,
point is not placed appropriately in the base buffer.  This probably
isn't worth taking the time to fix given that calling magit-blame from
indirect buffer isn't very common (since the above error has yet to be
reported)."

Depending on option `magit-revision-show-xref-buttons' diff buffers may
end with a ""back"" buttons.  When refreshing a buffer we try to select
the reincarnation of the previously current section and if that fails
fallback to the reincarnation of some ""related"" section, like the next
sibling or parent.  The final fallback is whatever section came after
the selected section before the refresh and has a reincarnation after
the refresh.  In diff buffers that very often is the ""back"" button, but
focusing on that section is useless.  Instead we explicitly detect this
case and instead of going to that button go to the beginning of the
buffer.

When `package.el' is used to update a package whose libraries have
already been loaded in the current session, then parts of the loaded
version can leak into the new version during byte-compilation.

This can be avoided by compiling the libraries in a separate Emacs
instance.  The library `async-bytecomp', which is part of the package
`async', does just that by advising the function `package--compile'.

So add `async' as an Elpa dependency, soft-require `async-bytecomp', and
if that succeeds, then turn on `async-bytecomp-package-mode' to activate
the advice.  Because it is undefined which package is updated first, and
which library is loaded first, we have to this in both possible
candidates `with-editor' and `magit-popup'.

Users may update `magit' without updating the dependencies, so we have
to further force the updates of all the Elpa packages that are build
from the Melpa repository.  To do so we depend on ""20150808"" snapshot
versions instead of ""2.2.0"".

When installing Magit manually, then `async-bytecomp' is not required,
because Magit is then compiled using the Makefile which already uses a
separate, untainted Emacs instance."

Use the new `magit-read-string-ns' in most places where previously
`magit-read-string' was used.

buffer-local variable `magit-diff-section-file-args' to hold the value
of the file filter.  The refresh suffix command from the popup now
update both variables, and `magit-diff-arguments' includes its value
in the return value when appropriate.

The `magit-insert-{unstaged,staged}-changes' functions respect the new
variable and because the user might otherwise not be aware that a file
filter is in affect in the status buffer, a new section inserter,
`magit-insert-diff-filter-header', is added to the default value of
`magit-status-headers-hook'.

The new function `magit-popup-import-file-args' takes care of combining
the file filters into the pseudo argument form used inside diff popups."

Previously `magit-diff-popup' used the value of `magit-diff-arguments'
to initiate the values of its infix arguments.  (Usually the global
value, but due to user errors it could also have been the buffer-local
value).  That made it impossible to change what diff is shown and at the
same time to keep using the previously modified arguments.  (Unless the
modification was explicitly saved, but that caused the value to be used
in all repositories.)

When the `magit-diff-mode' buffer exist for the current buffer, then
`magit-diff-popup' now gets the arguments from that buffer's
`magit-refresh-args', even if that buffer is not current when the popup
is invoked.  Unfortunately that is even the case when the user then goes
on invoking the `magit-show-commit' suffix command, which uses the
`magit-revision-buffer'.  We cannot do anything about that because we
cannot read the users mind."

Users are allowed to use `add-hook' et al. to add hook functions to hook
variables which have not yet been declared.  That means that the default
value of hook variables should not be set inside `defvar' and defcustom'
forms, because those definitions are only evaluated if the variable has
no value yet (in case of `defcustom' it would be used to get the default
value though).  When the user used `add-hook' earlier, then it obviously
has a value.  So we are supposed to set the default value outside of the
declaration form, using `add-hook'.  But that has a few downsides too.

If we set the default value outside of `defcustom', then Custom would
think that the default value is `nil' (and would be right about that)
and tell the user about it, which could confuse her a lot.

So we set the default value inside `defcustom' *and* outside using
`add-hook'. Sight.  That's still not good enough though.  Re-evaluating
the file or buffer containing these `add-hook' forms would override all
user customization.

So we place the calls to `add-hook' before that to `defcustom' and
additionally wrap the calls to `add-hook' to make sure they are only
ever run once.  Sight.

(unless (find-lisp-object-file-name 'HOOK-VARIABLE 'defvar) ...)
  (add-hook 'HOOK-VARIABLE ...) ...)
(defcustom HOOK-VARIABLE '(...)
  :options '(...)
  ...)

Double sight.

We *don't* do the above for section hooks, which users are supposed to
modify using `magit-add-section-hook'.  Instead we teach that function
to raise an error when the user attempts to add a hook function to a
hook variable which has not been defined yet.

In `magit-status-internal' do not let-bind `default-directory' to ""pass""
the top-level directory to `magit-mode-setup'.  Generally doing so would
be okay for this particular variable, while one should of course usually
use function arguments to pass values.

In this particular case binding `default-directory' confuses
`magit-mode-get-buffer' which is used by `magit-mode-setup'.  The result
would be that it were no longer possible to use `C-u C-u C-x g' from
within a repository to switch to another repository whose top-level
directory has the same basename as that of the current repository, when
`magit-status-buffer-name-format' contains `%b', i.e. when we only show
the basename in the mode-line.  It would think that we are already in
that buffer (because the dynamic binding of `default-directory' appears
to claim that we are).

So instead we should pass the path to the repository to be visited by
passing it to `magit-mode-setup' using a new function argument.  But
that's not possible because it would break existing code. We have to
use a new variable `magit-mode-setup--topdir' to pass the value to
`magit-mode-setup'.

Starting with v2.1.0, ""RET"" no longer checked out the reference at
point, instead it was shown using `magit-show-commit'.  I have decided
to restore the old behavior, which unfortunately requires the below
hack because the references in this buffer use the same section types
`branch' and `tag' as in other buffers, and `magit-show-commit' is
bound in the respective section type keymaps.

So replace that command with `magit-visit-ref' in the those keymaps.
Except in `magit-refs-mode' buffers this command simply calls the
regular `magit-show-commit' command.  In refs buffers, on a reference,
it instead checks out that reference, like RET used to do.  With a
prefix argument it instead just focuses on that reference.

`ediff-cleanup-mess' is not run; that function is not suitable for
our needs.  But it also means that additional functions added by
the user will be ignored.

So add an alternative hook variable `magit-ediff-quit-hook', which
replaces `ediff-quit-hook' when Ediff is invoked using a Magit
command.

Add the existing function `magit-ediff-cleanup-auxiliary-buffer' and
the new function `magit-ediff-restore-previous-winconf' to the new

Previously the intention was that `ediff-cleanup-mess' would take care
of this.  That function expects that the control buffer is current when
it runs, but our own hook function, which runs firsts, restores the
pre-ediff window configuration, making that buffer non-current.  So
`ediff-cleanup-mess' ended up doing nothing.

Reversing the order does not work because our function also expects that
the control buffer is current.  Also `ediff-cleanup-mess' does things to
the file-visiting buffers that we are not interested in.

So instead set the local value of `ediff-quit-hook' to a single
function, our own cleanup lambda.  This means that the global hook value

For file-visiting buffers the VC package show the file's status in the
mode-line.  We used to call the *function* `vc-find-file-hook' after
reverting such a buffer to help VC keep it up-to-date.  However that
function is terribly inefficient and does other things we usually don't
need.

Instead use a new function `magit-refresh-vc-mode-line' which is like
`vc-mode-line' but simpler, more efficient, and less buggy.

Then instead of calling that function unconditionally add it to the

Previously two modes existed which saved transient changes (i.e. changes
that have not been committed to regular refs yet) by either committing
to a work-in-progress ref or by creating a stash.

These two modes are being replaced with three new modes which all save
changes to two different work-in-progress refs.  Previously only one wip
ref existed (per branch); it was used to save changes in the worktree.
Now there are two such refs; one for the worktree and one for the index.

The old `magit-backup-mode' which saved changes using stashes, is
removed without a direct replacement.

The old `[global-]magit-wip-save-mode's are renamed to
`magit-wip-after-save-[local-]mode', they behave mostly the same as
before.  This mode is similar to `make-backup-files', but it creates
a backup whenever the buffer is saved, not only the first time (and
obviously it saves the ""backups"" elsewhere).

However ""editing a file"" is not the only way for users to change a file
when using Git/Magit.  One can also ""apply"" a change to a file, in fact
that's the only way one can change the ""index version"" of a file.
`magit-wip-after-apply-mode' covers this case.  When that mode is
enabled the Magit commands that apply changes to files and/or the index
then also explicitly commit the changes they have made to the wip refs.

They only commit the changes that were just made, which avoids having to
check each and every file for changes.  Doing it this way is very
important for performance reasons.  However if a user makes changes
through other means, then these changes are not being committed to the
wip refs after they are made and therefor it is possible to lose those.

`magit-wip-before-change-mode' solves that problem.  When that mode is
enabled, then commands which may discard changes that have potentially
not been saved to the wip refs yet save them before making their own
changes.  Again only the files known to be affected by the upcoming
change are saved.

Sometimes it might be useful to explicitly safe all changes to all files
to the wip refs, which can be done using the command `magit-wip-commit'.

Besides the performance gain, another advantage of explicitly saving
some changes instead of blindly saving everything, is that we can use
commit and ref-update messages which indicate which command caused
saving changes to which files.  Those more informative messages make it
easier to find the changes one needs to recover from such wip commits."

Previously we used `git rev-parse --show-toplevel' to determine the
toplevel directory of the current repository and used that as
`default-directory' of Magit buffers.  `--show-toplevel' always chases
symlinks, and so we ended up visiting the truename of that directory.

That's not nice and so we now use `--show-cdup' and construct the
absolute filename from that and `default-directory' using
`expand-file-name'.

Also remove several kludges where filenames had to be normalized
using `file-truename' and similar, before being compared to the
`default-directory' of Magit buffers.

However a user may explicitly set `find-file-visit-truename' to t.
To cover that case `magit-mode-setup' now respects that variable
when first creating a buffer."

`magit-toplevel' differs from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel' which it
uses internally, in that it also works from inside the .git directory
and in bare repositories.  The new STRICT argument can be used to
suppress these fallbacks.

Also add the new `magit-with-toplevel' macro which just let-binds
`default-directory' to the toplevel directory."

hopefully.

In `magit-expand-git-file-name' turn paths such as
- /cygdrive/c/the/repo
- /c/the/repo
into paths like
- /c:/the/repo

If it turns out that there are places where an absolute path is
requested from git, then we need to use this function there too.
But I think this function is currently used when appropriate.

This issue only exists, or so I assume, when using Cygwin Git with a
non-cygwin Emacs.  It this were the case, then it would be appropriate
to only use this kludge when the `system-type' is `windows-nt'.  But I
am not sure, so for now it is also used when it is `cygwin'.  In the
latter case it could be that Git returns `/c/the/repo' while Emacs
expects `/c:/the/repo'.

Previously we used text properties but we never managed to fully teach
Emacs what we mean by ""invisible"".  We mean ""cannot be seen with the
eyes"", as opposed to ""position that has the `invisible' text property
set, when taking into account text property stickiness and whatever else
is relevant"".  We did force the appropriate stickiness and added a post
command kludge to work around that not having the desired effect.  And
maybe there was a bug in that.  But I do suspect there is a bug in Emacs
itself with regards to ""taking into account text property stickiness""
when moving to the edges of the abyss - but I am not sure.

Anyway, by using an overlay we bypass all that.  When using an overlay
the default rules seem to lead to ""invisible"" := ""cannot be seen by the
eyes"".  For the most part this is implemented by copying the respective
code from `outline-flag-region', so it is code that has been around for
a long time.

There is one difference; when hiding a section body, we do *not* hide
the newline at the end of the heading but *do* hide the newline at the
end of the body - `outline-flag-region' does the opposite. That means
that hiding the body does not remove the background color of parts of
the heading - and that we cannot display an ellipsis at the ""end of the
heading"" (that wouldn't be visible).

This change will also allow isearching invisible section bodies, but
that isn't enabled yet - it still needs some work.

What differs between these two:

isn't that the later rebases `--onto' something; all rebases do.  The
difference is that in the former case everything not in UPSTREAM is
rebased, while in the latter case only a subset of the ""local"" commits
is rebased.  So NEWBASE is actually the same thing as UPSTREAM, and
""UPSTREAM"" should actually be named START-POINT or something like that.
And instead of an `--onto' argument there should be a `--from' argument
or instead of a branch it should be possible to specify a range:

somewhat expensive, so caller which know which is the case continue to

When `magit-diff-paint-hunk' is called without the HIGHLIGHT argument
then it used the new `magit-section-selected-p' to figure out whether
it should highlight or unhighlight.

`magit-section-selected-p' needs to check whether the section it

Also remove the variable `magit-diff-refine-hunk-related', which was
a temporary hack.  Like in the last release and before, it once more
is only possible to refine all hunks or the one and only current hunk.
Remove the option to refine all selected hunks."

When a hidden hunk section is selected it is no longer highlighted, and
when it is deselected it is no longer unhighlighted.  In many cases this
avoids unhighlighting and the rehighlighting again when moving back,
both of which would be useless because the affected part of the hunk is
not even visible.  This also affects un-/refining.

Instead hidden hunks that are not yet highlighted are highlighted when
they are expanded.

The heading of the hunk, which usually is visible, is un-/highlighted as
before, when ever the section is de-/selected.

When forgoing to unhighlight a hunk section
add it to `magit-section-highlighted-sections' and
remove it from `magit-section-unhighlight-sections'.

Hunks are still the only sections which are ever added to these
variables.  Which means that all other sections are always
un-/highlighted, even when that would not be necessary.

The old reason for why we don't avoid un- and rehighlighting other
sections is that doing so is believed to be cheap.  Implementing the
necessary housekeeping to avoid doing so might be more expensive even.

There is a new reason now: if an ancestor section of a hidden hunk
section whose body highlighting is not correct were marked were added to
the list of fully highlighted sections, then the delayed highlighting of
the hunk would fail.

All members of `magit-section-highlighted-sections' are known to be
fully and correctly highlighted.  Other sections might or might not
be fully and correctly highlighted, but we don't keep track of it."

In `magit-section-update-highlight' check whether the current section is
the same as the one that was current before.  If that is so do nothing.
This makes moving inside diffs much cheaper.  We keep track of the
current section using the new variable `magit-section-highlighted-section'.

Because sibling selection overlays are highlighted during highlighting
and therefor not tracked as region overlays, their removal has to be
forced by setting `magit-section-highlighted-section' to nil.  Therefor
we might still do some unnecessary re-highlighting after deactivating
the region."

When there is an active hunk-internal region, then no longer create
the necessary overlays during section highlighting.  Instead create
these overlays by hooking into Emacs own region overlay mechanism.
Also no longer make the regular region overlay invisible (doing that
relied on an error which prevented the overlay from being visible).

Instead just don't create that overlay if we create other overlays
to represent the region.  Beside the hunk-internal region overlays,
this also includes the overlays that are created when highlighting
sibling sections.  However these sibling section overlays are still
being created during highlighting."

That release is the first to implement parts of the region overlay
handling in elisp.  The change in the next commit depend on the ability
to do just that; it allows decoupling hunk painting from section
highlighting.  And that in turn enables various significant performance
improvements.

So we have to do it - poor performance is most often voiced criticism.
This had to happen eventually.  There have been many small reasons why
dropping support for older Emacsen would have benefited the maintainer
and the majority of users.  Now there is a big one.  Note that one of
the reasons I released 1.4.0 was to have a recent release which still
works with older Emacsen.

Aside from just not doing that at load-time, there are some additional
requirements to make this work.

* When using `make lisp' to compile outdated libraries, the targets are
  first removed.  Otherwise compiling e.g. `magit-stash.el' would result
  in `magit' to be loaded, which in turn would result in the outdated
  `magit-stash.elc' to be loaded and the byte-compiler to complain about
  it.

* The name of the loaddefs file has to be hardcoded in `magit.el' as
  well as the `Makefile'.

* `magit-maybe-backup', which is called before applying a change, to
  create a backup stash, in case `magit-backup-mode' is enabled, as to
  be defined outside of `magit-backup.el', because that's one of the
  libraries we try to avoid loading.  The old `magit-maybe-backup' is
  renamed to `magit-backup-maybe', and the new `magit-maybe-backup' just
  checks whether the latter is defined and if so calls it.  The latter
  is still ultimately responsible for deciding whether to backup or not,
  and does it exactly as before, there's just an additional redirection
  now.

* Many commands that are defined in the delayed libraries were not
  autoloaded.  It is important that we do that now.

* When the delayed libraries cannot be autoloaded because
  `magit-autoloads.el' does not exist, then we have no choice but to
  fall back to loading them upfront.

Note that we have to continue to always load certain libraries after
providing `magit'.  These are the libraries that define section
inserters which are used by buffers, whose major-modes are not defined
in these libraries themselves."

The MS Window port which can be downloaded from

instead something named 1.9.5 was finally released two weeks ago.
Previously the port was stuck on an even older release.  Git proper
itself never used the v1.9.5 tag - I don't know what's going on here.

So for MS Windows users the new minimal version now is the so-called
v1.9.5, for users on other platforms it is the actual v1.9.4.

I would have liked to go with v2.0.0, but cannot do so until an easily

Add the new popup `magit-ediff-popup' from which all ediff variants can
be invoked.  Bind `E' to that, and remove the old direct meta-<key>
bindings used for the individual commands.  These bindings were always
just kludges and I already intended to find a better solution when I
added them.  (As much as possible Magit should limit its keybindings
to letters).

The `magit-ediff-dwim' gets a new binding `e'.  Only `r' is now bound
to `magit-rebase-popup', but since we are running out of keys, having
two keys bound to the same command is no longer an option.
`magit-ediff-dwim' gets the better binding than `magit-ediff-popup'
because the former ... well dwims.  But not always which is why the
popup had to be added."

On Windows, Emacs formats file names as e.g. c:/path/to/somewhere. This
causes a mismatch with Cygwin's git, which uses /path/to/somewhere.

Bridge these two by calling `expand-file-name' on the result of
`magit-get-top-dir' before calculating its length, so that it's in the
same format as the file's name. The file's name is in that format via
`file-truename', and also because it probably came from Emacs rather
than git."

The problem was that we inserted a gap by *completely* filling the

and because buttons *never* are long enough to fill the column, the
code responsible for doing that came to the conclusion we are about
to insert column n+1 when we were about to insert column n.  It then
noticed that the space reserved for column n was not completely used
up (actually not at all) and inserted spaces for that column.

By inserting a single space we fix that.  Inserting nothing at all for
a gap would not work, because then we would have the same problem in
reverse.  The code responsible for padding would then, when inserting
the next item think we are still at column n-1 when we actually are at
column n."

Remove `magit-diff-scope's SINGULAR argument, if that actually behaves
as it was already previously described in the doc-string when SECTION
is non-nil, then this is not necessary.  I.e. when SECTION is specified
return the type of that, not that of a possible selection.

As a result, also treat the `region' type as a singular, because that's
what it is.  `list' is a singular to, by the way.  Only `hunks' and
`files' are not, the presence or absence of the ""s"" suffix helps
remembering what is plural and what not.

Make `magit-section-internal-region-p's SECTION argument optional, and
when it is present actually use it.  Also make sure the region is inside
SECTION (or the current section if that is nil).  Previously we instead
did something strange in `magit-diff-scope', which resulted in `region'
being treated as a plural with the respective singular being `hunk'
which isn't correct.

The bugs being fixed by all this is that previously `magit-diff-scope'
returned `files' when it should have returned `files' (this was the case
in `magit-discard-apply' and `magit-reverse-apply') and that this bug is
fixed in a way that does not introduce a new bug where `magit-diff-scope'
returned `hunk' instead of `region', as the previous attempt at fixing
the first bug using c3535abe38e2cee9b65d7ef798a22989d1eb0419 did."

Rename the existing `magit-git-string' to `magit-git-str'; it should
only be used when a non-zero exit status is expected and does not
constitute an error.

Add a new `magit-git-string' which uses `magit-git-insert' and, when
`magit-git-debug' is non-nil, therefor reports a non-zero exit status
in the message area as well as by creating a section with Git's stderr
in the process buffer.

Most callers of `magit-git-string' keep calling that function, i.e
switch to the new implementation; they start reporting errors.  Note
that this does not cause an Elisp error to be raised.  The purpose
of this change is to make it easier to debug, and not to gracefully

1. Trying to do so for an automatically buffer-local variable is not
   allowed and causes an error.  Don't know why it has to be that
   way, but that's certainly not something I'm gonna complain about.
   This means that for some variables we would be unable to use such
   aliases even if we wanted to.  See #1711.

2. I (a) would want to define them in a single block not sprinkled
   across the various libraries, and (b) they have to be defined before
   the new option is defined, or customized values would be lose.  See
   #1693.  But I also would rather not have that block be pretty much
   the first code someone looks at when starting to read the source
   code.  Not such a big deal in itself, but combined with the others...

3. The removed set of aliases is an essentially random subset of aliases
   out of the much larger set of alias that could be defined.  It
   doesn't really make sense to define these but not the others, and
   determining the others would be a lot of work.  I would much rather
   spend that time doing something more productive."

In `magit-insert-branch-1' only calculate the number of unmerged files
if FORMAT (`magit-local-branch-format' or `magit-remote-branch-format')
contains ""%c"".  In `magit-insert-tags' only do so if `magit-tags-format'
contains ""%c"".  Add new variable `magit-refs-indent-cherry-lines'.

Calculating the number of unmerged commits is less demanding than
calculating cherry commits, but it's still to slow in big repositories.

To avoid doing so use something like:

(setq magit-local-branch-format ""%C %-25n %U%m\n""
      magit-remote-branch-format ""  %-25n %m\n""
      magit-tags-format ""  %-25n %m\n""

Rename the hook `magit-revert-buffer-hook' to `magit-after-revert-hook',
for consistency with the built-in `after-revert-hook'.  Run the hook,
after potentially re-enabling `magit-blame-mode' (which is a special
case explicitly handled in `magit-revert-buffer'), previously we did
it before.

Add the new hook variable `magit-not-reverted-hook' which is
run by `magit-revert-buffer' if, and only if, it does *not* run
`magit-after-revert-hook' (because there was nothing to be reverted,
i.e. the file did not change on disk).  This is for the benefit of
third-party extensions which do need to do something in that case.

Finish by always calling the _function_ `vc-find-file-hook'.  This
function is intended as a member of the hook `find-file-hook'.  It
is also called directly in a few other places, this is one of them.
Previously this function was only called when the buffer had to be
refreshed, now it is always called, mostly so that the mode-line
get's updated (that might need updating even if the file did not
change)."

Use `magit-toplevel-safe' instead of `magit-get-top-dir'.  The latter
returns non-nil in bare repositories also, which is not helpful because
we only refresh files in the working directory anyway.

Use `file-in-directory-p' instead of `string-prefix-p', because the
former is safer.  Only check that the file is in the repository; do not
also check that it is _not_ in the git directory.  That's unnecessary
because a git repository cannot track a file "".git/FILE"" anyway, and we
already check whether the file is a member of the list of tracked files.

Note that `magit-toplevel' and by extension `magit-toplevel-safe' use
`git rev-parse --show-level' which chases symlinks.  So we have to take
care when using `file-in-directory-p' or similar: we have to compare the
`buffer-file-truename' and not `buffer-file-name'.  We already did that.

Depending on whether there are more tracked files in the current
repositories or open buffers overall, take a different code path,
avoiding unnecessary work.  Move some of the shared code into the new
function `magit-revert-buffer'."

This solves issue #1647 for git stash communicating with GPG. My guess
is that the asynchronous process is actually able to read the tty that
it needs to talk with gpg-agent.

I looked at the same code on the 'next' branch, and `magit-stash` has
been totally redone. I was unable to properly reproduce my issue on that
branch, but that's because it was not working in other, unrelated, ways.

That said, this is more of a hotfix since it is branched off 'master'."

Showing all untracked files can be slow.  So respect the Git variable
`status.showUntrackedFiles' allowing users to make it faster at the
cost of not being able to stage every untracked file individually.

That variable defaults to ""normal"" which means that when directory
contains nothing but untracked files then only the directory is shown.

Before respecting this variable Magit showed each untracked files using
an initially collapsed tree.  Doing that would probably be the more
reasonable default, but I will delay the final decision until after the
following and just do what Git would do for now.

In the future we might use `magit-status.showUntrackedFiles' instead of
sharing `status.showUntrackedFiles' with Git.  Then we could also have
another default (""all"") without anyone being able to say that doing so
was wrong."

This is intended as a temporary solution to the problem that `git branch

many branches.  This variable will likely be replaced by a `git-config'
variable, once Magit starts using such variables for ""repository-local

Add new function `magit-log-read-revs' and use it read one or multiple
revs or ranges on behalf of `magit-log'.  It uses code from built-in
library `crm' but not the `completing-read-multiple' function defined
there.  "" "" is used to separate revs and "".."" is internally treated as
a separator too, but to the caller that is invisible, e.g. ""A..B"" is
returned as the range it is, i.e. as a single string.

Replace the option `--branches=' (which isn't badly needed anymore)
with the switch-only version `--branches'."

Teach log commands that are commonly invoked from the log popup to
limit history to commits which touch certain files selected in the
popup using the new ""-- "" argument.

Add `magit-log-read-files', which uses `completing-read-multiple', to
read multiple files from the user.  Store the read value as a single
string, because that's all that the current popup implementation
supports.  Then in `magit-log-read-args' separate that string from
the other arguments, split it into a list of files again, and return
that list separate from the other arguments.

Adjust `magit-log-refresh-buffer', `magit-insert-log` and
`magit-insert-log-verbose' accordingly.

confusing to non-experts."

Add `magit-show-refs-current', like `magit-show-refs-head' previously
did it compares the other refs with that branch.  The latter now
compares the other refs with `HEAD'.  The difference is that the
""current"" variant locks the refs buffer to a branch; after checking
out another branch and refreshing the buffer, it continues to compare
the other refs with the (previously current) branch, while the ""head""
variant locks to the `HEAD', checking out another branch or detaching
`HEAD' will cause the refs to be compared with another rev, the one
`HEAD' then points to.

Low level support for this distinction was implemented quite some
time ago but the commands did not take advantage of this distinction.
The only thing that changes is that level is that ""HEAD"" now stands
for itself, previously the ""head variant"" was represented by `nil'."

In the past I have been criticized for both, (a) adding useless
confusing arguments, and (b) refusing to add essential arguments.

Different users have different needs and I won't be able to make
everyone happy.  Here I have chosen to remove lesser used arguments
which would confuse the non-expert.  The expert is welcome to add
these arguments back, I have invested quite some time making that
possible - use the functions `magit-define-popup-switch' and
`magit-define-popup-option'."

Instead use all lowercase letters and try to make them consistent

For action keys we cannot do completely without uppercase letters,
we use uppercase for the ""verbose"" variants.  However use ""o""/""O""

use the former for the ""act on something other than the default""

Previously only one command to push a branch and one command to pull a
branch existed.  Now there are several variants for pushing as well as
pulling.  They are all available from the respective popup which makes
it much easier to push to or pull from a branch which is not the already
configured upstream branch of the currently checked out branch.

Previously one had to remember exactly how many prefix arguments on had
to use to do something ""unusual"" and even then most ""unusual"" things
were not possible.  I for one did at least 2/3 of my pushes and pulls
in a terminal, but no more.

Add new commands `magit-pull-current', `magit-push-current',
`magit-push-elsewhere' and `magit-push-matching'.  Add the functions
`magit-pull-read-args' and `magit-push-read-args.  And adjust the

The `magit-push-popup' features the `--set-upstream' argument, which is
how this sort of thing is usually done in Magit.  Until now `magit-push'
might also have asked the user whether she wants the upstream to be set.
The option `magit-set-upstream-on-push' was used to control under which
conditions the user was asked and the use of two prefix arguments did
override the option.  Remove the option and ignore prefix arguments with
regards to this.

Most things that was possible before are still possible, but there are
no longer multiple ways of doing the same thing.  The only exception is
that it is no longer possible to tell `magit-push' to refuse to push
when the upstream is not set."

Also adjust the various callers and the option `magit-no-confirm'.

This is another milestone in the efforts to make completion consistent.
Here we do so by coupling confirmation with completion.

When a command can either (a) do something with the items represented
by all sections in the region, (b.1) the item represented by the
current section, (b.2) some item which is the default for some other
reason or (c) an item read using the minibuffer, then combine (b) and
(c).  I.e. instead of asking ""Delete branch master?"", give the user
the opportunity to confirm, abort _or_ to choose another branch:
""Delete branch (default master):"".  This is especially useful because
the default is not always the thing-at-point, so we would have to
request confirmation anyway.  When the default is what the user wanted
then ""RET"" is just another way of saying ""yes"", and ""C-g"" means ""no"".

If the user only had the choice between ""yes"" and ""no"", then we would
have to provide another way to pick something other than the default,
i.e. using a second command or a prefix argument.  That's much less
convenient.

For such commands which may act on the selected section(s) _or_ some
other default, do _not_ provide the possibility to disable confirmation.
If acting on one item requires confirmation, then acting on multiple
items should also require confirmation.

For other commands which may act on a single thing or multiple things
but in a fully predictable way (always act on the section at point or
the sections in the region) we don't allow the user to pick something
other than the default.  In these cases allow disabling the need for
confirmation.  This mostly concerns commands that act on files.

Finally there are commands that perform actions that are not tied to a
certain a set of items out of a larger possible set, e.g. aborting the
ongoing merge.  Here too allow disabling the need for confirmation."

we cannot use `magit-get-top-dir' because that only works in existing
directories.  Create `magit-toplevel-safe' to use when it is unknown

In `magit-status' cleanly separate the ""initialize"" special case from
the rest, previously it was not possible to create a new repository
inside another using this command.  As a result this command is no
longer suitable for non-interactive use and `magit-status-internal'
has to be factored out.

contain other things besides diffs change `magit-diff-section-arguments'

Also add `magit-diff-set-default-arguments' and

Do _not_ add these arguments to the popup default value or to that of
the variable `magit-diff-section-arguments'.  Note that these arguments
were _not_ previously used ""by default"", the were used unconditionally,
because there was no other way.  Enabling this by default isn't
desirable because it decreases performance.

Also use ""--no-prefix"" (which also was a member of the removed variable,
but unlike the other arguments is mandatory) explicitly where previously
the variable was used."

Some time ago this broke and the arguments set in the popup were simply
ignored.  The last few commits improved how we deal with diff arguments,

arguments from the popup (using `magit-current-popup-args') and then
use them when calling `git diff'."

Use different variables for diff arguments depending on the mode.

In diff-only buffers (whose major-mode derives from `magit-diff-mode'),
continue to use `magit-diff-arguments'.  This _should_ then be used
to set the buffer-local value of `magit-refresh-args'.  But this is
currently not the case and won't be fixed until the next commit.

In also-diff buffers (which contain diffs but also other sections,
e.g. status buffers) we cannot use `magit-refresh-args' because
the diff sections would compete with other sections over who gets
to store their information in there.  So we use the new variable
`magit-diff-section-arguments'.

A later commit will add a new popup which actually allows changing the
value of either `magit-refresh-args' or `magit-diff-section-arguments'.

To make dealing with these complications easy add the new utility
functions `magit-diff-arguments' and `magit-diff-arguments-variable'."

Previously the same popup was used to show a ""new diff with the selected
arguments"" and to ""update the arguments used by the current diff"", which
was rather confusing.  A bigger issue however is that in the former case
the arguments are not actually respected.  To make it easier to fix that
first remove the ability to do the latter.  Once the former has been
fixed, the functionality removed here will also be restored, but then
using a dedicated popup and new setter commands."

Add the new function `magit-diff-set-context' to do all the heavy
lifting for `magit-diff-{less,more,default}-context'.  This replaces
`magit-diff-previous-context-lines' which only determined the
current (aka previous) value.

The main advantage of this approach is that this will allow using
different variables in diff-only and also-diff buffers, which will be
implemented in a later commit.

By default Git shows three context lines, but until now we did not avoid
having the redundant argument ""-U3"" as a member of the arguments list.
`magit-diff-set-context' is now capable of doing that, but that also
means that `(not (member ""-U0"" args))' no longer is sufficient to check
whether any context lines are shown.  Add new `magit-diff-context-p' for
that purpose."

The region can be used to select either several sibling sections or a
range of lines within a single hunk section.

When several sections are selected they are now all displayed the same
way each one of them would be displayed if it were the current section.
If the selected sections are diff file or hunk sections then their
headings are additionally displayed in a different face to make it more
obvious that multiple sections are selected.

When the region spans lines within a hunk then only these lines are
propertized using the usual distinct faces for added and remove lines
lines.  Lines inside the hunk but outside the region are propertized
using the context face, that includes lines beginning with ""+"" and ""-"".

Highlighting of the current section now works like this.  The section
is highlighted using an overlay with covers all of the section.  If
multiple sections are selected each one of them is highlighted using
a separate overlay.  Each highlighting overlay has to be added to
`magit-section-highlight-overlays'.  After each command all of these
overlays are deleted and new ones created as needed, which isn't as
wasteful as it may sound.

Highlighted hunk sections and sections that contain such sections
also use an overlay but it only covers the heading.  Hunk bodies are
propertized using text properties.  Each section which uses properties
for highlighting has to be added to `magit-section-highlighted-sections'.
These text properties are not discarded after every command; properties
are only changed for those sections which are newly or no longer
highlighted."

Until now only sections that had at least one character inside the

usually wasn't part of the selection.

Commands that only know how to act on a single section simply ignore
the selection and instead act on the current section.  When the current
section wasn't considered part of the selection yet this was problematic
because users don't necessarily know which commands use the selection,
so they might select A and B, while point is on C and invoke a command
with the intention to do something with A and B but instead end up
having something done to C.  Now they would expect something to happen
with A and B, and it would only happen to B, which is much less
problematic."

be refreshed too; but unless we take extra precautions `point' would
later (when we actually display the buffer) be reset to the value of

Add new variable `with-editor-server-window-alist' to allow libraries

change or remove entries added by packages.

Add function `with-editor-server-window' which determines the
appropriate value on behalf of `with-editor-process-finish' and our
advice to `server-switch-buffer'.  Previously that function and that
advice arranged for the buffer-local value of `server-window' to be
used.

That hack had one advantage: it allowed packages to only _sometimes_
disrespect the value of `server-window'.  That is no longer possible,
e.g. Magit forces the use of `pop-to-buffer' for commit messages even
when it was not involved in initiating the commit.  (Actually it does
not use that function, but the effect is the same).  On the other hand
this allows the removal of all kinds of ugly kludges from Magit."

respected by `with-editor' every time a Git command that would create
such a buffer was called.  That was an ugly hack, because we used a
global variable to ""pass information"" to the code that would later
create and display the buffer.

Remove that hack consisting of the variable `magit-server-visit-args'
and the functions `magit-server-visit-args' and `magit-server-visit'.

`magit-server-visit' was also used to fiddle with window configuration
when showing the changes that are being committed; and to save the
commit arguments, to help `magit-diff-while-committing' later show the
correct ""other meaningful diff"".  Turns out this function doesn't need
our help to do so. And the window configuration tricks are now performed

Each section, except for the root section, begins with text which
directly belongs to it.  For sections which have children that is the
heading.  Then come the child sections and almost all text that follows
is part of these child sections.  The only exception is that after all
children there may be a single empty line, which serves to separate the
expanded section from its next sibling.  When the section is collapsed
that newline is also hidden.

This is the ""newline after children"" exception.  Until now there was one
other section: after the headers in the status buffer there was an empty
line separating from the following section which was not part of the
sections that wrap the headers.  It has been like this for a long time
and the reason I did not change it was that I felt that there should be
a separator between the headers and the first non-header section even
when the headers are collapsed (meaning that only the ""Head"" header is
showing).  I haven't really changed my mind on that but feel that the
elimination of this special case is much more important.  (We could
emulate the old look by adding a separator section after the headers,
which consisted of only a newline)."

The second variable, whose value are the selected shell arguments, was
previously named `NAME-defaults', unless the `:variable' keyword
argument was used.

For most popups this name makes sense because the variable never hold
anything but the default shell arguments.  But for the diff popup this
didn't work well, because that variable is used for other things also.
So we used the name `magit-diff-options' in that case.

Now we change the names of all argument variables (including that of the
diff popup) to `magit-TOPIC-arguments'.  Note that there is no `-popup'
in that name; if NAME ends with ""-popup"" then the macro removes that
before appending ""-arguments""."

""Commit"" is used both as a noun and as a verb.  To avoid confusion
rename `magit-commit-mode' to `magit-revision-mode'.  This mode
deals with existing commit objects, while `git-commit-mode' is used
to create them, using `PREFIX-commit-mode' for both would be confusing.

Rename some functions and variables accordingly, also rename
`magit-wash-commit' to `magit-diff-wash-revision', and
`magit-insert-commit-button' to `magit-diff-insert-revision-button'.

the action or state is ment , so don't rename every affected symbol,

Previously we read the branch name first and then the starting-point,

mean that we could not provide a default based on the starting point

This is a backport of 9af9551470d1f10295ebd0aa5c1fac079a829e1d from
next, but where that completely removes the ability to create a local
branch whose upstream is a remote branch when using `magit-checkout',
this only removes the unnecessary complications that resulted from a
misunderstandings of what ""tracking branches"" are.

Similar functionality might later be restored on next.

Variable `log-edit-comment-ring-index' has to be buffer-local but isn't
marked as automatically buffer-local and since `git-commit-mode' cannot
derive from `log-edit-mode' we too have to explicitly mark it as such
in `git-commit-setup'.

`git-commit-prev-message' differs from `log-edit-previous-comment' in
that it saves the current buffer content in the message ring before
replacing it in the buffer with the previous message using the latter.

`log-edit-comment-ring-index' is nil until `log-edit-previous-comment'
is first used, at which point it is initialized to point to the last
(if going backward) or the last (if going forward) message in the ring.
Because the last message is the one we just save, we have initialize
ourselves *before* calling `log-edit-previous-comment' otherwise we
would ""go back"" to the current message.  When going forward or when
there was no message to be save this is irrelevant, or rather doing
so would actually be counterproductive, so we don't."

Previously mainly one function, `magit-read-rev', was used to read all
kinds of branches and arbitrary commits and ranges from the user.  Two
other, specialized functions already existed, `magit-read-local-branch'
and `magit-read-remote-branch', but these functions weren't used much.
Because `magit-read-rev' was very generic all callers had to duplicate
code responsible for determining the default choice and other things
that could have been abstracted away.  Aside from the duplication the
main problem was that the various defaults were not always consistent,
i.e. there were several commands that should have defaulted to the
current branch, but instead defaulted to just ""HEAD"".

Remove function
  `magit-read-rev'
remove variable
  `magit-read-rev-history'
add functions
  `magit-read-branch'
  `magit-read-branch-or-commit'
  `magit-read-other-branch'
  `magit-read-other-branch-or-commit'
change functions
  `magit-read-local-branch'
  `magit-read-remote-branch'
add variables
  `magit-revision-history'
  `magit-stgit-read-patch-history'

The functions whose names do not contain ""no-commit"" now only complete
branches.  The functions whose names do contain ""no-commit"" also offer
branches for completion, but also other refs, and furthermore they do
not restrict what the user can input, and even the default choice may
not be a branch.  When the default isn't a branch these functions try
to use a relative name such as ""master~3"" but we do not yet impose any
restrictions against which branches relative names are created.  Users
may also insert complete or abbreviated hashes.

In fact users could input arbitrary non-sense and there is no protection
against that yet, like there wasn't with `magit-read-rev'.  We currently
use this ""feature"" in an additional new completing function
`magit-read-range-or-commit'.  For now this is merely a stub, actually
it even is just an alias for `magit-read-branch-or-commit'.  Eventually
we need a completing function which can complete on both sides of "".."".

The functions that contain ""other"" in their names take an optional
EXCLUDE argument.  When that is non-nil then these functions offer
branches different from that branch for completion, instead of those
different from the current branch.  Of course the excluded
branch (whether given explicitly or when defaulting to the current
branch) is never used as the default choice.

The new and improved completing functions are now consistent in what
they use as the default choice.  They use the branch at point (or commit
at point where appropriate) as default.  If there is no branch/commit at
point they use the current branch as default, except for the functions
whose name contain ""other"" which use the previous branch as default, and
prevent the current branch from even being selected explicitly.  Most of
the completing functions now take an optional argument DEFAULT, which
can be used to override the secondary default, i.e. the branch/commit at
point remains the default (if it isn't the excluded branch), but there
is nothing at point, then the value of this argument is used as default
instead of the current or previous branch.  There are only a few callers
which make use of this, but for a few it makes much more sense to
e.g. default to the tracked branch."

Actually we already began with that some commits ago, but this is the
beginning of the final step.

The goal is to have five top-level sections: Options, Inspect,
Manipulate, Transfer and Miscellaneous.  The main split, which makes it
necessary to move many second level sections is between Inspect,
Manipulate and Transfer.  Because not everything fits perfectly in these
three categories, we also need Miscellaneous.  Even so some things that
will be placed in one of the tree main sections, will not fit perfectly.
Some inconsistency cannot be avoided.

This commit renames Modes to Inspect and moves Porcelain>Visit to
Inspect>Files.  Because Visit was the first subsection of Porcelain and
now is the last subsection of Inspect, we can do so by moving the
Porcelain heading instead of the Visit code.

Also change the names of the subsections of Porcelain, losing the ""-ing""
suffix.  Now Porcelain is a misnomer, because other sibling sections are
just as much about porcelain - and just as much *not* about that.  We
cannot split Porcelain into Manipulate and Transfer yet, because the
subsections are not in the right order yet."

This patch changes the regular expression that is supposed to match the
lines containing ""modified:"" or ""some-file.txt"" in the example below. It
is desirable that this regexp does not match multiple lines.

    #       modified:   git-commit-mode.el
    #
    # Untracked files:
    #       some-file.txt

The reason is that if the commit message contains a diff (i.e. ""git
commit -v"" was run) the ""[^:]:"" regexp can match multiple lines if there
is a colon in the diff. In the example above, the match would span from
'some-file.txt' up to the colon in the diff. This results in overriding
the font-locking in the diff.

Refactor the commands `git-rebase-move-line-up',
`git-rebase-move-line-down', `git-rebase-kill-line',
`git-rebase-rebase-exec', `git-rebase-show-commit' and as well as the
utility function `git-rebase-edit-line', which is used by many of the
other commands.

The behavior of these commands changes slightly, in that they no longer
try to avoid moving point to the beginning of the line.  Previously
some of them did, while others did not.  Now they consistently do what
I prefer (move to bol) and which is also easier to implement.

Thanks to that we can now remove the utility functions
`git-rebase-looking-at-action' and
`git-rebase-looking-at-action-or-exec', and replace the constants
`git-rebase-action-line-re', `git-rebase-exec-line-re' and
`git-rebase-dead-line-re' with just `git-rebase-line'.  Also define
some regexps directly in `git-rebase-mode-font-lock-keywords'."

When there is a command on the current line then always edit it.
Even when it is commented out, like before that is uncommented
but the prompting also happens.

A prefix argument now forces prompting for a new command, instead
of editing the command on the current line.  So the behavior of
the prefix argument is more or less reverses.

This also allows the removal of the utility functions
`git-rebase-looking-at-exec' and `git-rebase-looking-at-killed-exec'."

This variable was used when padding the leading keywords of header lines

that use headers with keywords that are longer than those used in Magit,

that - so far unused - feature.  If needed this can add such a variable
again.

We already defined a keyword regexp for comments, but that was
redundant.  We also set `comment-use-syntax' to nil, but that only
affects the commands in `newcomment', not actual fontification.

We now turn off syntactic fontification by not adding `core.commentchar'
to the syntax table as a comment starter .  Instead we add it as
punctuation.  (The major mode might already have added it as a comment
starter, we need to override that).

For some reason when a syntactic-pass string appears inside a
regexp-pass comment, then nothing on that line actually is displayed as
comment.  Until we know the cause of this, we work around it by also
defining potential string delimiters as punctuation."

Add a single function `magit-process-git-arguments' which prepares
the arguments to Git.  This includes flattening the list of arguments,
prepending `magit-process-standard-options', and when Cygwin Git is used
the quoting of certain problematic strings.

All of this is now only done for Git processes, previously we did also
flatten arguments in `magit-call-process' and `magit-start-process'.
Also avoid repeatedly flattening the arguments, by only doing so at the
lowest possible level, in calls to built-in process functions, i.e. in
`magit-git-exit-code', `magit-git-string', `magit-git-insert',
`magit-git-lines', `magit-run-git, and `magit-start-git'.

Arguments are now fully flattened.  Previously only the first level was
flattened.  Or at least that is what the doc-strings claimed, in reality
a varying number of levels was flattened (because the ""one-level only""
flattening happened several times).

Because the argument list is now fully flattened - just before calling
Git - we can also drop several uses of `apply'.

Remove the option `magit-process-quote-curly-braces' (for Cygwin Git)
and instead put the test previously used to set its value directly into
`magit-process-git-arguments'.  While there never is absolute certainty
with things concerning Windows, there also have been no reports about
the quoting happening when it shouldn't, or not happening when it
should.  So remove the option to avoid confusing users (also the
doc-string was not really correct)."

`auto-revert-handler' does quite a few things we don't need, so instead
of using that just call `revert-buffer', `vc-find-file-hook' directly.

Since that also means that our advice to `auto-revert-handler' is
no longer used also turn `magit-blame-mode' off and on again when
appropriate.  But do not remove the advice, it is still needed when
`auto-revert-handler' is called outside of our control."

Add `magit-ediff-resolve-file', a simple wrapper around `smerge-ediff',

only unresolved commits are shown.  Ediff was created in the age of vcs
that are bad at merging and has not yet been adjusted for dvcs like Git
and Mercurial, and so it actually wants to do all everything that needs
to be done to do a merge.  However we want to initiate the merge using
Git and then we want Ediff to help us with the conflicts Git could not
automatically resolve; we don't want to also have Ediff attempt to
resolve the conflicts that Git already resolved, especially because
Ediff fails more often than Git, causing the user additional work.

use Ediff to resolve conflicts, not to do a merge."

Replace `magit-show' with the more fine-grained `magit-find-file',
`magit-find-file-other-window', `magit-find-file-noselect', and
`magit-find-index-noselect'.

The removed `magit-show' did to much, probably because the old and by
now removed ediff wrappers expected it to do so.  The upcoming new
implementation of the wrappers won't need that to the same extend, and
where they do they will dispatch the appropriate `*find-file*' function
themselves.

Also change and extend the buffer-local variables used in these blob
visiting functions: `magit-buffer-file-name' now is an absolute file
name, just as `buffer-file-name' is.  The function by the same name is
removed.  Instead teach `magit-file-relative-name' to default to the
current file/blob when its FILE argument is not provided.  Replace the
variable `magit-show-current-version' with `magit-buffer-revision' and
`magit-buffer-refname'; the former is the full commit hash, while the
latter is the revision as provided by the user, which is also used in
the `buffer-name', and might not actually be a refname.  Make the
`buffer-name' match what `vc' would use as closely as possible.

Remove the variable `magit-log-file', since `magit-read-file-from-rev'
retrieves the same information directly from `magit-refresh-args' now,
and `magit-log-file' is not used anywhere else.

This is intended as an intermediate implementation, whose time will end
once I get around to implementing a file-handler for blobs and trees."

Always backup the applied diff when `git apply' is used.  Previously we
only did so when `git apply --reverse' was used.  We now backup more
diffs, but this still is not sufficient, so add appropriate warnings to
the relevant doc-strings.

The fate of this backup mechanism is undecided, I might replace it with
a mechanism based on `git stash' or I might improve it.  The problem
with the former is that it requires a (trivial) patch to git-stash, and
latter likely leads to complications elsewhere.

Because this no longer is only used when `--reverse' is used (which we
used to wrongly refer to as ""revert"") rename the involved functions and
variables, `magit-{revert => apply}-{backup,backup-file,undo}'.

Save the arguments used when applying the diff as diff pretext, and in
`magit-apply-undo' use the inverse of these arguments (which might mean
adding or *removing* the `--reverse' argument)."

Add a new mode `magit-refs-mode' which replaces the two old modes
`magit-branch-manager-mode' and `magit-wazzup-mode'.  The new entry
command is `magit-show-refs', replacing `magit-branch-manager' and
`magit-wazzup'.

Originally these had to be different modes because wazzup was so
slow that users would only tolerate it when they actually needed the
additional information it provided compared to the branch manager.
I have made wazzup fast quite some time ago but until now didn't get
around to merging the two modes.

The new mode is called ""Refs Mode"" because it lists all kinds of
references not just branches (that was already the case of the old
""'Branch' Manager"" too)."

While both ""revert"" and ""reverse"" are used for some kind of ""undo"",
these actions are only somewhat related and definitely not the same.

While a `revert' Git command exists, there is no `reverse' command.
That term appears in form of the `--reverse' argument to the `apply'
command.

Because it is confusing that the command `magit-revert' does *not*
use or do the same thing as the command `git revert', rename it to
`magit-reverse', which makes sense because it ultimately ends up
using `git apply --reverse'.

Improve how the default value of `magit-emacsclient-executable' is
determined.  If we fail to do so, show a warning.

We determine whether an emacsclient executable is compatible with the
current Emacs instance by comparing its version with `emacs-version'.
The versions don't have to match exactly, but at least the major part
has to do so.

This commit changes how an executable's version is determined.
Previously we simply used the version suffix of the executable.
Unfortunately when Emacs is installed manually, then the emacsclient
executable usually does not have a version suffix, and so we did fall
back to the suffix-less executable which comes first on `exec-path',
which is a lottery.

Now we use `emacsclient --version' to determine the version, and the
order in which version-suffix-less emacsclient executable appear on
the `exec-path' therefor no longer matters."

Generally speaking, highlighting the current section using the
background color means that any text in that section which also sets
a background color different from that of `default' loses its special
appearance.  For things like ref names we work around this by using
overlays.

But we didn't do that for added, removed, and context lines in diffs,
even though the default values of the respective faces did only set the
background color but not the foreground color.  This was fixed by some
third-party color themes by instead using the foreground color instead
of the background color to differentiate lines in diffs.

This commit makes such kludges unnecessary.  It is still possible to do
it the old way, but it is not recommended, because doing so makes it
much harder to come up with faces for hunk refinement which both look
good and are sufficiently visible.  (Using bold is not a good option;
it's easy to overlook, and for whitespace it doesn't have any effect at
all.)

So hunks are now treated as a special case when highlighting; instead of
`magit-section-highlight' the new faces `magit-hunk-heading-highlight',
`magit-diff-added-highlight', `magit-diff-removed-highlight', and
`magit-diff-context-highlight' are used.

Furthermore we don't use overlays to apply these faces but the face text
property.  Doing it this way avoids problems with `diff-refine-hunk'.
If we did use overlays these overlays would in some cases override the
refinement overlays."

No longer inherit from `diff-{added,removed,context}' because these
faces only define the background color.  It is better to also define the
foreground color because other faces that overlay the text propertized
with these faces might also set the background color (which would shadow
the background colors of the diff faces, but not their foreground colors).

This is specially problematic because in Magit the current section is,
by default, highlighted using the background color.  That will be fixed
in the next commit, but the same applies to the region."

Previously `magit-section-highlight' inherited from
`secondary-selection'.

Doing so had the advantage that for most themes this face is
sufficiently distinct form other faces without requiring any further
customization.  The default background color for `secondary-selection'
was selected so that it works regardless of what changes were made to
other faces.  This is done by using a background color which unlikely
to be used as background or foreground color for any face in most
reasonable themes.  The disadvantage, and result, of this is that
this face always looks very out of place.

For `secondary-selection' this works (not the ""secondary"").  But for
`magit-section-highlight' it doesn't; we use that face all the time,
and we want Magit to look okay when using the default faces (dark or
light)."

For most headings the heading face is only used for the actual text but
not for the following newline.  This makes a difference when the
background color is set for the heading face.

For hunk headings we also propertize the newline and by default also set
the background color, which makes diffs more readable because this
clearly separates different hunks from one another.

Until now we also did that for files because a diff may contain several
files and separating them clearly makes sense the same way it does for
hunks.  We did not actually set the background color by default, but
users who wanted to visually separate files the same way that hunks are,
just had to do so.

However if the background color actually is specified and spans the hole
line then the region is not visible when selecting multiple files.  This
would be very confusing so remove the ability to set the background for
the complete file heading line."

aesthetic choice.  The effect on performance is not noticeable and so
it is okay to drop support for this.  It is still possible to have the
visual effect of not highlighting the current section by unsetting all
face properties or setting these property to the same value it has in
the `default' face.

Once a theme has set a face property it is not possible for user to
unset that property again, she can just change it to something else,
but not nothing.  This was a problem until recently, but now this can
be worked around by setting that property to the same value it has in
the `default' face."

Make `magit-insert' and `magit-put-face-property' always use overlays.
Previously it was possible to use text properties which theoretically
gives a small performance boast.  But the option to do the latter was
more confusing than helpful and I doubt that anybody actually made use
of it, especially because doing so would force the use of something
other than the background color for highlighting the current section."

Under a seemingly harmless condition, set `disable-point-adjustment' to
t using `post-command-hook' to prevent the event loop's usually helpful
point adjustment from going berserk.  The following was also added as a
comment:

  So we ended up at the beginning of a section, which also is
  the end of the preceding sibling section, if any.  There are
  two markers here.  If the preceding section is hidden, then
  we are also at the end of an invisible text range.  So far
  so good.

  But if we ended up here because we moved upward (but not when
  moving downward), then ""point adjustment"" messes up badly.
  Visually point would still be in the right spot but according
  to the function `point' we would be somewhere else; at the
  beginning of the preceding section, which isn't even the
  first position ""at the other end of the invisible text"".
  The existence of markers appears relevant, but not their
  insertion types.  Wtf!

  If we are not at the start of a section then do not disable
  ""point adjustment"", because when we truely end up *inside*
  an invisible range, then moving outside is a good thing."

The reason we needed this kludge was that process sentinels which may
cause point to move inside invisible text and which also have to be
considered part of some command did not actually run until after the
command returned.  The editor command loop then went on to do its point
adjustment and then run ""threads"", including the sentinel of the process
started by the command which just returned.

These sentinels were likely to cause point to end up inside invisible
text, but when they ran it was to late for the command loops point
adjustment to kick in.

We used to work around that by using `post-command-hook' which happens
to be run even later than pending ""threads"".  Running such sentinels
after the command has already returned caused other issues besides this
one and so that was fixed by waiting inside the command for the process
to return.

This is the right thing to do because the only reason why asynchronous
processes are used in the first place is that this allows sending input
to the process.  But as far as Magit is concerned these processes should
be synchronous.  Now we wait, making at least the commands ""synchronous""
and this kludge unnecessary."

Commit 11dc61ec479d671510e4c18ac73dfe096ad89518 intentionally changed
the behavior of pressing ""x"" on a commit.  Starting with that ""x"" did a
hard reset instead of a mixed reset, because ""U"" already does a mixed
reset.  Unfortunately many users would not notice this change until
they had already nuked some uncommitted changes.  So let's revert to
the old behavior.  ""x"" does a mixed reset again and ""C-u x"" has to be
used for a hard reset.

Add the new command `magit-revert' which behaves like
`magit-revert-head' used to do and bind ""x"" to it.  Locally I revert
this revert by binding ""x"" to `magit-revert-hard' again."

Remove `magit-section-action'.  All commands that need to dispatch based
on the type of the section at point now do so using `magit-section-case'.

The most important of these commands are `magit-stage', `magit-unstage',
`magit-discard', and `magit-revert'.  These commands now only act on
hunks, files, and the sections containing file sections.  Until a short
while ago these commands used to also act on other section types but
that caused these commands to be severely overloaded and their purpose
to be obscured.

This has been fixed by instead using per-section-type keymaps which only
have an effect within the sections of the respective type.  By using
text-property keymaps, the same keys are bound to commands that do
things *similar* to what the respective *diff* commands mentioned above
do - but only when point is within the appropriate sections.  While e.g.
""discarding a hunk"" and ""deleting a branch"" indeed do something similar
(""throw something away""), these actions are not similar enough for it
to make sense to have one command which is capable of doing both.
Using the same key on the other hand is reasonable.

The new mechanism, per-section keymaps, is not only cleaner, it is also
more flexible and easier to understand by contributors and authors of
third-party extensions - because it is the mechanism used by everything
else for this purpose.  The alternative would have been to improve
""section actions"" until finally we would have effectively reimplemented
keymaps."

This is indeed silly, but so is adding ""LIBRARY.el ends here"" (in the
age of version control), and that is a convention!  The reason I am
doing this now, is that I once more have yanked a new section before
""LIBRARY.el ends here"" while all existing sections were collapsed
(committed but fixed before being pushed).  Theoretically I know doing
so results in the new section being placed after the `provide' form and
file-local variables, but it seems I always forget when I actually do
insert a section right before the library end, so let's make sure that
doesn't cause any harm."

For a while we had a command `magit-push-dwim' separate from
`magit-push' for two reasons:

`magit-push' used to run hook `magit-push-hook' allowing `magit-topgit'
to override its behavior.  Since the previous commits we no longer use
it that way.

Since that hook existed anyway I decided to rename `magit-push's legacy
implementation to `magit-push-dwim' and add a new `magit-push' that did
run that by default.  This was done in preparation of the still
outstanding deprecation of the legacy implementation, which I think is
fairly bad, because it overloads pushing with only marginally related
functionality and departs to much from what Git does.

However there likely are some users who disagree and I intended to keep
the old implementation which for a while was known as `magit-push-dwim'
under the name `magit-push-oldschool', it is now known as just
`magit-push' again and is still going to be deprecated eventually."

Previously `magit-topgit-mode' added specialized functions to four
different command-specific hooks run by fundamental commands that are
part of Magit's core.  These commands did only run these hooks so that
`magit-topgit' could override the behavior of these commands.  I think
the behavior should never be overwritten in such a way.  And the core
of Magit certainly shouldn't be obfuscated to accommodate an extension
hardly anybody uses (280 downloads from Melpa, Magit itself has 57000).

Regardless of whether doing what we used to do is okay or not, we don't
have to do so because there is a better option: use a popup just for
TopGit commands.  Being parasites the TopGit ""commands"" where not
actually commands but regular functions, so that has to be fixed too."

Do not use ""action"" hooks such as `magit-visit-hook' run by the command
`magit-visit' to add ""specialized variants"" of these actions for section
types added by extensions.

Such hooks are implemented using `magit-section-action' and I think that
adding this extension mechanism was a mistake in the first place.  Emacs
already has an extension mechanism that can be used to do this sort of
thing: the `keymap' text property.

Replace all uses of action hooks in `magit-stgit' and `magit-topgit by
using that `keymap' property for the text that is part of such
additional sections.

Both extension mechanisms have advantages and disadvantages.  Most
importantly the use of the `keymap' text property means that it is no
longer possible to change just one keymap to use another key for an
action, not only for core commands but also those defined by extensions.
On the other hand there now is a place where users can look to get a
list of all ""special commands for a certain section type"", the
respective keymap."

Until now the term ""item"" was used as a second order observation.  It
denotes that we do *not* differentiate between the gui element and the
object it represents.  The former is not a useful distinction and should
be avoided by removing ""item"" from symbol names and documentation.

The above actually makes sense, but unless you have read your share of
Luhmann, the information is lost.  So let's try again, using more words.

The main gui elements in Magit buffers are called ""sections"".  Sections
always have a ""type"", and either represent some object, in which case
they also have a ""value"", and/or serve as containers for other sections.

In Magit the object represented by some gui element could be something
like a file, commit, or hunk.  In Emacs speak the term ""thing"" is
usually used for an object that generally could be categorized, when we
don't actually want to or cannot make that distinction.  We don't use
""item"" for that.

When we name a command `magit-VERB-item' we are neither saying ""VERB the
thing represented by this gui element"", nor ""VERB this gui element"".  We
are saying ""VERB (either the gui element or the object it represents)"".
So `*-item' does not make it any more obvious whether something is done
with the gui element or the represented object.  What it emphasizes is
that we *don't* make that distinction, i.e. the distinction it makes is
that we don't make the distinction that could actually be useful.  That
is less useful than not making a distinction at all.

Maybe ""item"" used to be a synonym for exactly one of ""section"" or
""thing""; but if that ever was so, then that meaning has long been lost.
Contemporary uses include ""highlight the item at point"", but also ""open
the file whose name can be seen at point"".

So, lets rename symbols whose names used to contain ""item"", in most, but
not all, cases by simply removing the ""-item"" suffix.  Also remove
""item"" from doc-strings, where it is replaced with either ""section"",
""thing"", or in some cases the actual type or types of the ""things"", as
appropriate in the individual cases."

be addresses in a later commit.  In fact `magit-log-head-label-tags'

Also note that we now use two distinct faces for local and remote in

collapse sections unless the *magit-process* buffer was already visible

to that buffer to see why something is taking long, only to first have
to expand the respective section.

Never-the-less it is useful to hide sections whose output the user
""probably doesn't want to see"" in most cases.  So when a process returns
with exit code then the section is automatically collapsed.

Likewise inserting the exit code into the process sections buffer is now
done in a more reasonable way, without ending up putting point somewhere
inside the heading, instead of at its beginning.

Also do not put an extra empty line between sections and remove some
other kludges.  Now that headings are inserted before their bodies we no
longer need to do that."

Separate the task of inserting and washing output from a command from
the task of creating a section.  This in a sense was already the case
previously in that `magit-cmd-insert-section' made use of the macro
`magit-insert-section' to do the creation part.

Replace `magit-cmd-insert-section' and `magit-cmd-insert-section' with
`magit-git-wash'.  It is just a thin wrapper around `magit-git-insert'
which additionally calls some function to wash the inserted text.  It
also knows how to cancel the section currently being created if either
Git produces no output or washing the output completely.  That is
different from what `magit-cmd-insert-section' which never canceled
before calling the washer.

Code that previously used `magit-git-insert-section' now has to
explicitly use `magit-insert-section', `magit-insert-heading', and
`magit-git-wash'.  That usually means that it takes four lines of code
instead of tree to do so, but it also makes this more flexible and
prettier to look at.

There is no substitute for `magit-cmd-insert-section', i.e. we now only
provide a ""insert-and-wash"" function for Git but not arbitrary commands,
because, well that's what Magit is about.  There were only two direct
uses of `magit-cmd-insert-section', one in `magit-stgit.el' and one in
`magit-topgit.el'.  These uses are now replaced with a bit of code
duplication."

Doing it this way is not necessary at this point yet, but it does give
us additional flexibility.  I.e. code that inserts a section no longer

Remove the HEADING argument from `magit-with-section' and instead expect
the callers to insert the HEADING themselves, using the new
`magit-insert-heading'.  Besides inserting the heading text in a fashion
similar to how the more general `magit-insert' works, this function also
sets the sections CONTENT slot to the position after the text previously
inserted.  The default value of that slot now is nil, indicating that
the section isn't divided into a heading and a body, i.e. it cannot be
collapsed.

Previously `magit-with-section' did evaluate its BODY to insert the
sections body text, and only then went back to the beginning of the
section and inserted the heading it had received as a separate argument.
This was done because when HEADING ending with "":"" indicates that the
number of child sections shall be shown in the heading.  We no longer
delay inserting the heading until we know how many children there are.
Instead we insert the heading without the count and then later go back
and insert the count.  Inserting the heading later than the body
complicated things a lot and lead to difficult to fix bugs."

little additional harm (in form of third-party code that might have
to be adapted), if any."

Originally there were these three related but distinct slots: `type',
`info', and `header'.  The last one was unnecessary and only existed
because someone got confused about the distinction between the other
two and was removed when I last refactored the section code.

Now the time has come to make the distinction between the ""type"" and the
""info"" more clear.  We start by using the term ""value"" instead of
""info"", because that's what it is.

There are two categories of sections: those that represent a thing, and
those that serve as containers for other sections.  A section can fall
into both categories.

Every section has a type, a symbol.  Sections that represent a ""thing"",
such as a file or hunk also have a value, usually a string (but that is
not enforced).  Sections that only serve as containers do not have a
value (i.e. the value is nil).

Together the type and value of a section and the types of recursively
all parent sections can be used to uniquely identify a section within
a buffer.  For container-only sections the types are sufficient because
there always is only one section of a particular container-only
type.  (That is a convention and isn't enforced.)  Meanwhile there can
be many e.g. `commit' sections and to tell them apart the values (here
the commit hashes) also have to be compared.

Sadly someone got confused along the way and started to use the just
the values (then more ambitiously called ""info"") to identify sections.
Since many sections don't actually have a value the result was that
for sections that would otherwise not have a value, the type was stored
in the `value' slot as well.

This commit adds function `magit-section-ident' which returns a list of
conses that can be used to uniquely identify a section as described.
Function `magit-find-section' is changed to use that value, instead of
using the value-except-when-it-actually-is-the-type.  For sections that
have no value the value of the `value' slot now is nil."

Previously staged and unstaged changes as displayed in the status buffer
were washed in two washing cycles.  All other diffs are and always were
washed in just one washing cycle, like everything else is too.  This was
either a historic accident or a failed attempt at improving performance.

If it was the latter then the motivation probably was that this allowed
delaying the insertion and washing hidden diffs until the got expanded.
However this actually decreases performance because it means Git has to
be called several times (at least on Windows where starting a process
seems to come with a huge overhead).

Getting the diff from Git once isn't what takes a long time, its Magit's
inefficient parsing and painting of the diff.  These steps have already
been made faster and we will be further improved.  If it turns out that
we cannot speed up the diff washing enough even for huge diffs then we
can still delay *washing only*.  To do that we don't have to also delay
the insertion of the diff."

Previously the first line of a hunk looked like it was a heading but as

contradict this statement, it just means that there is code within the
section handling that can deal with such broken sections, these kludges
could now be removed.  (We first have to make sure that no other section
remain that are broken in the same way, though.)

This commit turns the first line into a proper headings but due to the
inflexibility of `magit-with-section' with regards to how headings are
painted we have to delay the creation of the overlay until after the
`magit-with-section' has returned.  (The overlay is also a hack which

Git may truncate filenames in diffstats, and because we use these string
for more than just showing them to the user we have to fix that.

The real filenames become available once when the diffs are washed, at
which point store these filenames in the diffstats section objects too.
For that to work we have to somehow pass the diffstat sections to the
code that washes the diffs.  Previously that was done using the variable
`magit-diffstat-cached-sections'.

By merging `magit-wash-diffstat' into `magit-wash-diffstat' we can now
do the civilized thing and pass the information using function arguments."

Ever wondered why faces used for refs such as branch names have a
border?  It is because of this limitation mentioned in info node
`(elisp)Overlay Properties':

  Currently, all overlays take priority over text properties.
  Please avoid using negative priority values, as we have not
  yet decided just what they should mean.

So when a section is highlighted by changing the background (the
default), then all background colors things like reflabels that are
located inside the section loose their background color.  It seems
someone decided that just the foreground color being different from
surrounding text is not enough and also added a border to the faces
used for such things.  This has been reverted in some color themes
in others it has not.  After this change it is solely a matter of
taste, not visibility whether someone wants to keep the borders.

The borders will probably be removed from the defaults of these
faces eventually.  But this isn't urgent."

Decouple the ""edit session"" logic from the major mode used for editing
a commit message.

Previously `git-commit-mode' was a major mode deriving from `text-mode',
which got turned on for Git commit message files due to an entry in
`auto-mode-alist'.

Aside from ""being the major mode"" `git-commit-mode' was also responsible
for turning on `with-editor-mode', further setting up font-lock and the
comment logic, and then a bunch of other things.

The different concerns are now split up:

The new minor mode `global-git-commit-mode' serves the same purpose as
the entry in `auto-mode-alist' previously did: tell Emacs to use the
tools defined here when opening a Git commit message file buffer.  It
does so by adding `git-commit-setup-check-buffer' to `find-file-hook'.

Because this logic is defined in `git-commit-mode.el' and not built into
Emacs, it is no longer sufficient to autoload that library.  It has to
be loaded.  If it isn't loaded then the code which could cause it to be
loaded also isn't loaded yet.  Magit loads `git-commit-mode', so this
should not cause any problems for most users.  However users who do not
also use Magit will have to require this library in their init file.
There is no way around it.  All attempts to autoload the dispatch logic
would end up as being effectively equivalent to:

  ;;;###autoload (require 'git-commit-mode)

When appropriate, i.e. when the file opened actually is a Git commit
message file `git-commit-setup-check-buffer' then calls
`git-commit-setup', which does the following:

* Turn on `with-editor-mode', and add the commit specific hook functions
  to the `with-editor' hooks.  After this `git-commit-mode' does not
  have to worry about anything related to finishing the edit session
  logic anymore.

* Turn on the major mode.  Currently this can only be configured
  globally using the new option `git-commit-major-mode', but the idea
  is that `git config' can be used to set per repository major modes.

* Turn on `git-commit-mode'.  All that this mode now does is to setup
  the ""pseudo header"" and the ""message history"" key bindings.

* Setup font-locking and the comment logic using
  `git-commit-setup-font-lock'.  This currently cannot be disabled or
  further customized.

* Set `save-place' to nil and possibly modify the text
  slightly (inserting a newline).  This also cannot be disabled.

* Run the `git-commit-setup-hook'.  This is a user customizable hook
  that can be used to disable several things that were forced upon the
  user in the old implementation.  This can also be used to add
  additional features.

It is possible to change the major mode while editing the commit
message.  This is not generally recommended but it does not mess up any
of the most important features that without special steps would be lost
by the mode change.  This is done by making some variables permanently
buffer-local and by re-running `git-commit-setup-font-lock' after the
mode change.  However some of the auxiliary features that were enabled
by `git-commit-setup-hook' might end up being disabled."

Define a new minor mode `with-editor-mode' and the commands
`with-editor-finish' and `with-editor-cancel' which are used to end the
current buffers edit session.

Previously similar commands were defined for both `git-commit-mode' and
`git-rebase-mode'.  The ""finish"" and ""cancel"" commands for these two
modes should have been almost identical, however the ""rebase"" variants
were very insufficient and failed to cover most of the special cases the
""commit"" variants knew about.  The ""commit"" variants on the hand also
weren't properly designed upfront and as a result were rather magical.

Instead of improving these to variants independently, this commit
generalizes the concept, adds hooks to adjust the generalized functions
to the needs of its users, uses the generalized mode and commands for
committing and rebasing, and defines the hook functions necessary to
make the generalized implementation work for these two users."

* Add the constant `magit-server-window', replacing the options
  `magit-server-window-for-commit' and `magit-server-window-for-rebase'.

  We now support showing ""the relevant diff"" when committing and when
  rebasing (and in some other cases), but that only works reliably when
  we know where files opened by emacsclient show up.  Otherwise the
  buffer opened on behalf of the emacsclient might use the window in
  which we just displayed the diff.

  So we cannot have user change this.  Actually users who really really
  wants to, can still do so by setting `magit-server-window', *after*
  loading `magit.el'.

* Also change how the value of `server-window' is temporarily set to
  that of `magit-server-window'.

  Previously we used a timer in `magit-with-emacsclient' but that was
  not reliable.  Now we advice `server-switch-buffer' to use the local
  value of `server-window' in the buffer which is about to be displayed
  on behalf of the emacsclient.  Additionally we have to actually set
  that local value.  We do so by adding the new `magit-server-visit'
  function to `server-visit-hook'.  That function sets the local value
  to that of `magit-server-window' if the `buffer-file-name' matches
  the regexp `magit-server-window-filename-regexp'.

  That probably sounds rather complicated, but the old approach wasn't
  exactly straightforward either.  And additionally the latter was not
  reliable."

something similar ourselves.  Likewise that took care of making the

Now that we actually do use a mode derived `magit-mode' we also get that

Commit 1c4136e cleaned up magit-insert-untracked-files to always rely
rely on status.showUntrackedFiles, however it's broken when this
configuration is not set:
in such case 'git config status.showUntrackedFiles' returns nothing, not
the default value as the code expected.

Then git status was run just with ""-u"", which is equivalent to ""-u
all"". It's not what the user specified by not defining
'status.showUntrackedFiles'. It should be ""-u normal"" in such case.

This commit fixes and simplify this by removing the git config retrieval
altogether since git status reads this config, even with the
""--porcelain"" flag.

(This git status behavior is a little ambiguous in the man: it says the
output format will be stable ""regardless of user configuration"", so one
can wonder why the 'status.showUntrackedFiles' user config is not
ignored. But it's about the output *format*, and not the output itself.)"

This is (only) the starting point to implement more meaningful revision

bad.  Basically it and the code which surrounded it (not all of which
has been replaced yet) took the ""when in doubt, pick the worst possible
option"" approach.  E.g. instead of asking ""what do we have to complete?""
and answering that with (in nine out of ten cases) ""branches"", and then
going on to ""how do we get a list of branches?""; what we actually did
was ""find some git command that gives us a list of refs, pick the first
one, it doesn't matter whether there are better ones"", then start using
it, notice that the completion candidates contain many refs that we are
not interested in, implement ""filter out the uninteresting refs"", and
then keep on complicating things, making it less and less likely that
this will ever be fixed.  Well, I have had it, this crap has to go."

for that empty string.

Previously `magit-builtin-completing-read' did detect that case and
raise an error if `completing-read' returned an empty string.  Now
we do this in `magit-completing-read' so that this sanity check is
applied regardless of what `magit-completing-read-function' is used.

Five months ago I tried to have a discussion about starting to depend
on the external Dash library.  Unfortunately a troll appeared, making
any meaningful conversation impossible.  This was very stressful and
shortly after I almost had a burnout.

Back then I said I would eventually reopen the discussion.  I have now
decided not to do so and instead have start to depend on dash without
any further discussion.  I have considered the concerns raised back
then and have come to the conclusion that me having to work around
Emacs Lisp's limitations is a greater cost (not only to me, but also
to Magit as a project and to its users) than any of the concerns that
were raised.

---

I write Emacs extensions because working with ""the buffer"" as opposed
to e.g. ""the dom"" is rewarding.  On the other hand Emacs Lisp leaves
much to be desired.

Using Dash makes some of the major pain points go away.  That's why
many in the new generation of extension authors use Dash.  It makes
our lives easier if we don't have to constantly reinvent the wheel,
just so that we too get to use some of the improvement made to LISP
over the last few decades.

Users benefit too, because by using a library we can focus on the
project specific issue.   And when we use well tested and widely
used libraries instead of quick hacks, then bugs are less likely.

On the other hand this might cause some inconvenience for some users.
But it is the author not the user who gets to decide what language
(and in this case language libraries) the author uses.  By improving
Magit I provide a lot of convenience to its users.  A troll who attacks
me for occasionally doing things that make my life easier, instead of
his life, misses the bigger picture.  Consider it a reward for working
on Magit.

---

At this point I have just quickly scrolled though the code and started
to use forms from Dash in places that jumped at me.  There surely are
many more places where doing so would be beneficial.  As I run into
these places I will start using Dash there too."

WAS: remove almost unused ""marked commit"" functionality

Until recently this was used for three things:

- When selecting the target commit when creating a fixup/squash commit.
  That was a mistake and the result of me being urged to merge the
  squash functionality before I was fully satisfied with it.

- For the ""rewrite"" functionality which was removed in the previous
  commit.  If that is restored in a separate package, then the mark
  functionality would also have to be restored in that package.

- For the `magit-diff-with-mark' command which is being removed in
  this commit.

Aside from the rewrite stuff, `magit-diff-with-mark' was the only
command that actually did require the concept of a ""marked commit"".

I don't think acting on some marked commit like this command does, is
really necessary - there are usually other ways to get ""that other
commit"".  Also the diff popup and commands have been improved a lot
lately and will continue to be improved, making this particular special
command even less useful.

Regardless of the usefulness of this particular command, a single such
command does not justify the increases complexity that comes with the
""marked commit"" functionality.  Maybe at some later time we can bring
back this functionality and then use it for more things.  If many things
used this, then maybe it would be useful.  But a single command, that
only few know about, is not useful."

Git knows short human friendly names for refs like local branches,
remote branches and tags.  Until now Magit supported an additional,
incompatible representation, which had to be converted back and forth
and made refactoring related things impossible.  This commit removes
it, and I think that is no loss at all.

The only benefit I can see in the Magit specific representation is that
it might make completing refs slightly easier, because the thing that
one often wants to complete against is at the beginning of the string.
However that is not always the case, sometimes the thing one wanted to
complete against would have been at the beginning, if Magit had not
interfered.

Using a completion algorithm or framework that supports non-prefix
completion serves this purpose better.  Magit, to some extend, already
supports using alternative completion frameworks.  This can be further
improved.

productive feature."

Currently Magit does not provide a sane way of settings a branch's

(1) I think that by removing this feature, I do its users a service.
    Sure they will have to find an alternative in `cherry-pick' and
    `rebase --interactive', but once they have learned about these
    tools, they will be using vastly superior tools.

The ""diff range"" of each diff can be unambiguously determined when the
information is actually required.  For diff buffers the range can be
extracted from the buffer-local `magit-refresh-args' and for diffs in
the status buffer (staged and unstaged) the ""section context"" can be
used to do so.

So we shouldn't store that information in each hunk section before it
is even required.  Also we shouldn't loose information in the process.

This commit removes the code that did store the information but does not
replace it with code to get the same (well better) information when it
is actually required.  That isn't necessary yet, because Ediff the only
feature which actually made use of the static information has been
removed in the previous two commits.

Dynamically determining the diff range will be implemented when Ediff
support is being reimplemented."

When option `magit-expand-staged-on-commit' (to be renamed) is non-nil

Previously the function `magit-commit-maybe-expand' (remove in this
commit) was used to do that.  Doing it in `magit-commit-internal' is
better because that function has greater control over where which
buffers (commit and diff) are displayed.  To make that possible, also
add the new variable `magit-diff-switch-buffer-function' and use it
in `magit-diff'.

All callers of `magit-commit-internal' have to be adjusted, even
those that do not request a diff to be shown.

In `magit-commit-assert' also continue to optionally show the
appropriate diff, but do so without using `magit-commit-internal'
(that wouldn't work, previously `magit-commit-maybe-expand' was

`magit-mode-refresh-buffer' which is used to refresh any magit

So if point is e.g. at a commit inside one of the ""mini logs"" in the
status buffer and the log buffer is brought up, then point is usually at
the beginning of the buffer but may also end up at some random position.

This commit teaches log how to goto the commit that is at point in the
buffer that was current before the log buffer was created.  This is done
mostly for logs that are used to select a commit.  Support for such
special logs will be added in the next commit.  But instead of limiting
it to just these special logs we do this here for all logs.  This should

And most importantly focus on showing logs for refs and revs, not
ranges.  Showing logs for ranges really isn't all that useful, there are
cases when it is, but showing the history of a branch different from the

abusing the ""ranged log"" to show a branch (by omitting the end of the

command that created the buffer again, this time using different
arguments.  This isn't the case for the status buffer, there is no way
to pass arguments intended for `git diff' to `magit-status'.  In the
future we might do the same for `git log' arguments."

The macro `magit-define-popup' is used to define a popup, i.e. a command
to insert the popup; the arguments that can be set in the popup; and the
commands that can be used to exit the popup, using the set arguments.

Prior to this commit that meant defining a Emacs command and *three*
variables; one variable uses the same name as the command and is used to
store the popup plist.  Another is a customizable variable used to store
default values for the arguments.  And finally there was a variable that
used to store the popup specific keymap.

This commit removes the need for that keymap variable.  Now there is
only one keymap which uses remapping and default (`t') bindings to bind
the commands `magit-invoke-popup-action', `magit-invoke-popup-switch,
`magit-invoke-popup-option'.  Prior to this commit these were not Emacs
commands but non-interactive functions, and for each ""binding"" in each
popup an anonymous lambda command had to be defined.  Now they are
commands and they use information stored in the popup variable to do key
lookup.

* Add function `magit-invoke-popup' which is now called by each popup
  entry command generated by `magit-define-popup'.  Previously
  `magit-popup-mode-setup' did fill that role (and currently the former
  does nothing more than calling the latter).

* Add buffer-local variable `magit-this-popup-events' replacing
  `magit-popup-args'.  We now need to store actions in here too because
  we want to switch to an internal format, different from the alist
  stored in the ""definition variable"".

* Add function `magit-popup-get' which works like `plist-get' but
  knows whether the requested property is stored in the ""definition
  variable"" or in `magit-this-popup-events'.  It's also less verbose
  to use because the PLIST argument is omitted.

* Add function `magit-popup-get-args' which returns the list of
  arguments the way they are exposed as `magit-current-popup-args'.

* Add function `magit-popup-setup-events' which converts information
  from the ""definition variable"" to the internal format.  Currently
  it looks simple enough, unfortunately that will change as the
  internal format get's more complex.

* Remove function `magit-define-popup-keymap', because, there is but
  one keymap.

* Promote `magit-invoke-popup-{*}' to commands.  They should not be
  used outside a popup.

* Let-bind `magit-current-popup' when invoking an action from a popup.
  This is similar to `magit-current-popup-args' but holds the symbol
  identifying the popup, as opposed to the selected arguments.  This
  might be useful for actions that can be invoked from multiple
  popups."

in the latter.

These functions are now repurposed to let users customize an existing
popup definition.  In other words they now serve a similar purpose as
`define-key' does for regular keymaps.

Because each popup is still stored in two places, once as keymap and
once as an alist, these functions are still quite ugly.  That will be
fixes soon, when we stop using a keymap per popup."

Give all event sequences in popups a constant length.  For switches
and options always use a sequence that is two characters long; and
for actions always use a sequence that is a single character long.

There were only two popups that used sequences that did not already
conform with this new restriction: `magit-log-popup' and

longer sequences in any way, there are enough fine shorter sequences

One reason for this change is that these shorter key sequences are
nicer.  Another reason, which should not be concealed is that imposing
this restrictions will make many upcoming changes much easier."

Instead of passing the symbol that identifies the current popup around
as an argument, store it in the buffer-local variable `magit-this-popup'.

This allows turning `magit-popup-help' into a proper command, instead of
having to wrap it with an interactive lambda expression in each popup's
keymap.  In the next commit we will really benefit from this change, by
doing the same for other such lambda commands, effectively making popup
specific keymaps unnecessary."

The popup command and variable are now both usually named
`magit-VERB-popup'. VERB should be in infinitiv form (e.g. ""commit"").

Previously the command was named `magit-key-mode-popup-VERB', and VERB
was in -ing form.  The verb form is (and was) just a convention, and it
didn't even have to be a verb.  Actually it is now possible to use any
symbol name, because now the full symbol name has to be given.

We do not have to enforce uniformity by constructing the symbol names,
as there are other ways of enforcing consistency within Magit, and if
someone should happen to re-use the popup functionality outside of
Magit, then they are probably happy these symbols no longer are prefixed
with `magit-'.

Actually there is one more variable per popup: `...-map'.  That will be
removed soon, but yet another additional variable per popup will be
added, which will be named `...-defaults'.  In both cases the suffix is
fixed."

Define popups (using the new `magit-define-popup') right before the

This completes the move from one monolithic variable that holds the
data of all existing popups, to separate variables for each popup.
That makes it *much* easier to customize existing popups and add new
ones.

The intermediate step was, that to define a popup one had to manually
define a command, an alist variable, and a map variable.  Now all of
that can be done using this new macro.  By the way the map variable
will soon be made unnecessary and instead a new ""default argument
custom option"" will be added.  If it weren't for this macro such

This section contains all the things a user can tweak to adapt Magit to
her wishes.  I think it helps users to have such a ""all the settings are
to be found here"" section.

The new section absorbs the existing top-level sections ""Options"" and
""Keymaps"".  Some of the subsections that already existed in these old
sections, have new names now which better reflect their new surrounding.

The definitions of two `:set' functions for custom options are moved
right before their first uses, as we shouldn't begin the ""Settings""
section with code, that would kinda defeat the purpose.  Having them
later in between custom options also isn't optimal but since these
functions have to be defined before they are first used their aren't
all that many alternatives.

Move the calls to `define-obsolete-variable-alias' to the very end of
the file into a new section ""magit.el ends soon"" which also contains
things like providing the library feature and setting buffer local
variables.  And yes that's a comment on the library convents that in
the age of dvcs require files to end with ""this is the end"".  Also
I just couldn't think of a better name: ""Provide feature and somewhat
related stuff and final hacks"" doesn't seem so good :-)"

The (now) subsections that contain the definitions of individual
modes are currently spread across `magit.el' with unrelated sections
in between.  So as of now there are actually two top-level sections
called ""Modes (N)"".  That will be rectified eventually.

One of the subsections of ""Modes (2)"" is ""Ediff Support"".  Yes that
is wrong.  That section does not define a `magit-mode' derived mode.
Instead it defines (rather poorly) wrappers around Ediff commands.
I haven't decided yet where I want this code to end up but since I
am going to write `magit-ediff-*' variants of most `magit-diff-*'
commands, on possible approach would be to define these things in
the same place.  For now let's life with this inconsistency."

We use symbols to uniquely identify section types, and a long time ago
someone made the mistake to use the same symbol to identify two distinct

In `magit-init' use `magit-run-git' instead of the more low-level
`magit-run-git*'.

The latter should only be used in special cases, and should otherwise be
avoided.  Creating a repository now results in a refresh which is rather
pointless and has no effect because there cannot be any buffers to
refresh yet.  On the other hand checking whether anything has to be
refreshed also isn't costly enough to actively avoid it in this case.
The benefit is that I will not once more have to think about whether
there actually a reason `magit-run-git*' is used :-)"

Previously we did adjust point ourselves, because ""Emacs often leaves
point in invisible regions, it seems.""  However we did not actually
succeed in doing so because `disable-point-adjustment' is only set to
nil when a Magit mode is turned on, not for each and every command that
could possibly be run in a Magit buffer.  But that variable's doc-string
reveals that this doesn't have the desired effect:

  After a command is executed, if point is moved into a region that has
  special properties (e.g. composition, display), we adjust point to the
  boundary of the region.  But, when a command sets this variable to
  non-nil, we suppress the point adjustment.

  This variable is set to nil before reading a command, and is checked
  just after executing the command.

So I am removing our code that does the same, doing so does indeed not
change the behavior."

Remove the macro `magit-with-refresh' and the function
`magit-refresh-wrapper' which was used to implement it.

This macro was used to setup a dynamic scope in which a only a single
refresh could happen.  But it turned out that this is not actually
useful and only makes it harder to understand what ""refreshing"" means.
While that wasn't always the case there now is not a single case where
the use of `magit-with-refresh' actually prevented a second refresh.

Also remove the variables `magit-refresh-needing-buffers' and
`magit-refresh-pending', which were the variables that were dynamically
bound by `magit-refresh-wrapper'.

Also remove the function `magit-need-refresh' which was used to mark a
buffer as needing to be refreshed inside a call to `magit-with-refresh',
by adding it to `magit-refresh-needing-buffers'.

The only function kept are `magit-refresh', and a variation of that
`magit-refresh-all' only intended for interactive use.

The functions `magit-run-git', `magit-run-git-with-input',
`magit-run-stgit', `magit-run-topgit', and (on behalf of
`magit-run-git-async') `magit-process-sentinel', now call
`magit-refresh' explicitly after git has returned.

The ""process"" functions (some of them) are the only generic functions
that call `magit-refresh'.  Everywhere else `magit-refresh' has to be
called explicitly.  That's a good thing it encourages more fine tuned
refreshing."

Supporting a ""marked"" commit is problematic because that for every
feature being implemented it has to be decided whether that acts on the
""top"", ""marked"", or ""at point"" commit, provide a way to select the
other.  And then ""the other"" is yet again divided. Etc.  And then that
also differs between various features.  And then there might be
different opinions among users what is the right thing to do.  Etc.

Let's just not do it.  Also Magit's StGit is rather basic anyway, given
the few commands we actually have it is not necessary to have this
convenience feature (for users, for maintainers it's not a feature but a
nightmare)."

It is possible that a server file is not properly deleted after the
Emacs instance in which the server was running has terminated.  That
could happen if Emacs has crashes; there might be other reasons.

If the `server-name' is ""server"", then this isn't a big problem as we
then just append the pid of the process to the `server-name' and use
that instead.  If the server named ""server"" does indeed no longer exist,
that is not so nice, because we needlessly use a non-standard name.  But
we cannot do anything about it without jeopardizing performance (by
attempting to connect to the server, just to see whether that works).

If we cannot use ""server"" then we append the pid.  In the unlikely case
that the server file for ""serverPID"" already exists, we now
unconditionally force delete that server.  That server cannot possibly
be still in use because PID is unique and we already know it is not
running in the current instance."

Merge the options `magit-log-time-unit-as-character'

`magit-log-margin-spec', which additionally allows using a duration
spec different from `magit-duraction-spec' (which could come in handy
if people contribute specs for languages other than English).

Only calculate the width of time units once by doing it in
`magit-refresh-log-buffer'.  As a result the new buffer local variable
`magit-log-margin-timeunit-width' is needed.  `magit-set-buffer-margin'
is also now called from `magit-refresh-log-buffer'.

To begin with use the term ""margin"" instead of ""overlay"".  The fact that
we use an overlay to do this is an implementation, which is not of
interest to users.  So we use the term ""margin"" as part of symbol names
to give users an idea what this is about.  Remove the terms ""author"" and
""date"" from symbol names; we might later allow displaying other
information instead.

Rename the option
`magit-log-show-author-date' to
`magit-log-show-margin'.

Remove the functions
`magit-log-make-author-date-overlay',
`magit-log-create-author-date-overlays',
`magit-log-refresh-author-date', and
`magit-log-setup-author-date'.

Add the function
`magit-format-log-margin'
and the options
`magit-duration-spec' and
`magit-log-time-unit-as-character'.

No longer let git format the age of commits as human readable durations.
Instead use the recently added function `magit-format-duration'.  If we
kept on letting git do it we would have to parse git's output because it
sometimes uses two different units (which doesn't work for as because we
the available width is very constrained).  And we would have to do this
for N languages supported by git.  So let's just do it ourselves.  Users
have to customize the new option `magit-duration-spec' to use another
language.  That option can also be used to drop time units, e.g. to go
from days straight to months, omitting weeks. The algorithm used to
create time strings should probably be improved.

Use the recently added functions `magit-set-buffer-margin' and
`magit-make-margin-overlay' instead of spreading their (related but
separate) tasks across the removed functions and their callers."

Add function `magit-set-buffer-margin' as a smarter alternative to
`set-window-margin'.  Margins are local to a window, not a buffer.
In practice this is inconvenient.

This new function is similar to the built-in function in that it
arranges for the margin to be setup in the current window.  Additionally
it uses the `window-configuration-change-hook' to update the margin when
appropriate.  Effectively it gives the illusion that the margin is local
to a buffer.

Currently it always sets the right margin and leaves the left margin
alone; but that could be extended if the need arises."

The command `magit-show-stash' is just another variant of `magit-diff',
much like `magit-diff-working-tree', `magit-diff-unstaged', and
`magit-diff-staged'.  It currently differs from these command in that it
does not just convert some value into something else that is understood
by `magit-diff'.  Instead it calls `magit-mode-init' directly; but it
does use the same refresher, namely `magit-refresh-diff-buffer'.  So we
move `magit-show-stash' into the same section as `magit-diff' and the
other variants.  It will be renamed in a later commit.

The functions `magit-wash-stashes' and `magit-wash-stash' are not used
to display a list of stashes, as such they are only loosely related to
`magit-show-stash'.  We move them next to `magit-insert-stashes', which

will be merged into one."

we always did what we were previously doing here, then section actions
would just become another way of implementing local keymaps (whether
that be buffer local keymaps or the `keymap' text property), and a
rather poor one at that.

Only actions that are fairly close to one another should ever be grouped
in a `magit-section-action' or `magit-section-case'.  This isn't the

take into account that washing diffs is done in a way different from how
washing usually happens; inserting a diff involves washing git output
twice, and even though we are washing git output `magit-with-section' is
also.  That, unlike `magit-git-insert-section' does not cancel an empty
section and therefor returns t.  That led to an endless loop when for
empty diffs.

This commit is just a quick fix to avoid the loop.  A proper fix will
involve not washing twice, a change I intended to make anyway."

In past commit messages I have been bitching a lot about the variable
`magit-top-section'; grep history for a good rant :-)

This commit finally replaces it with two distinct variables, each
taking responsibility for one, and only one, of its two remaining and
very distinct objectives.

One of these variables is the new `magit-root-section'.  It is defined
as an automatically buffer-local variable, and should only ever be used
as such.  Its value is the, one and only, ""root"" section of the buffer.
A buffer can only have one root section; all other sections have to be
descendants of that section.

The value of `magit-root-section' is set by `magit-with-section' when
that inserts the root section.  This macro automatically detects when
that is the case, the user just has to follow the conventions.  (Which
still need to be documented.  I might also later add sanity asserts.)
Outside of this macro the value of this variable should only ever be
read.

The old `magit-top-section' was also abused to represent the ""section
that is the parent of the one currently being inserted"".  It has also
been used to represent the ""section currently being inserted"", but that
was fixed some time ago.

So the value of `magit-with-section--parent', the other new variable
to replace `magit-top-section', is the parent of the section being
inserted, not the one being inserted.

Then there also was `magit-old-top-section' whose value is the section
that used to be the root section before the buffer was erased to refresh
it, by inserting a new generation of sections.  This variable is renamed
to `magit-with-section--oldroot'.

The symbol name of these two new variables contain the full name of
`magit-with-section' because they should never ever be used anywhere
else.  They are used to ""pass"" information from one instance to another.
Dynamic bindings have to be used for this purpose, because the
alternative would lead to unnecessary complications.  While passing
values like this is a bit ugly, all the trickery is now contained in
`magit-with-section'.

Essentially the magic now happens in this part of `magit-with-section':

  (let ((s (car arglist)))
    `(let ((,s (make-magit-section
                ...
                :parent magit-with-section-parent)))
       ...
       (let ((magit-with-section--parent ,s)
             (magit-with-section--oldroot
              (or magit-with-section--oldroot
                  (unless magit-with-section--parent
                    (prog1 magit-root-section
                      (setq magit-root-section ,s))))))
         ,@body)
       ...))

If you think that is bad, then imagine what it was like when this logic
was spread all across magit.el; `magit-with-section--parent', `s', and
`magit-root-section' all had the same symbol name; that variable was
used for yet some other purposes; and much of the codebase was in denial
by hiding its uses inside various ""getter"" functions."

Set the `magit-section' text property in `magit-with-section'
instead of in `magit-propertize-section', which was called by
`magit-create-buffer-sections'.

Remove `magit-propertize-section', which now isn't used anymore.

The previous approach was to delay setting this property until all
sections have been inserted.  Then, starting at the root section,
recursively set the property for all sections.  This way the property
was first set to the parent section and then set again to the child
section.

Now, as soon as a section is inserted, the property is set, but only
for the part of its text that doesn't have it set yet, and therefor
does not belong to a child section.

Both approaches come with an (insignificant) performance penalty;
trade one for the other.  The approach we are now using is better
because the creation of a section should, as much as possible, be
""complete"" when `magit-with-section' returns and because this is a
step towards the eventual removal of `magit-create-buffer-sections'."

The variable `magit-old-top-section' is used to preserve state during a
refresh.  As of now the only state that is preserved when refreshing, is
whether the section is expanded or not.  Because of the way state is
preserved, determining the previous state involves a bit of work, which
is useless for sections that do not have a ""body"".  For such sections
being hidden holds no meaning, as the heading is always displayed, even
when hidden.

Previously `magit-old-top-section' was let-bound to nil around some code
that created such sections, effectively disabling the code that
determined the previous visibility.  That was very confusing: without
reading the code that actually used the variable's value, it was
impossible to tell what binding the variable to nil was supposed to do.

Here we just remove these let-bindings.  A later commit will make
""getting the previous state"" generally more efficient and as a result
make it unnecessary to add a hack to bypass doing so.  Actually I think
that the current code also is efficient enough, making the hack being
removed here, rather pointless in the first place."

  assume every other Emacs outline mode.

While inserting a section using `magit-insert-section' it can turn out
that there is no output from the PROGRAM that could actually be washed
to create the section.  This is the case because the PROGRAM, usually
git, isn't run *before* calling `magit-insert-section', but as part of
calling it.

As a result this function sometimes needs to ""cancel"" a section.  In
other words it has to undo all setup that has already been done. The
common setup is actually done by (the expansion of) `magit-with-section'.
After `magit-insert-section' is done with inserting and washing the
section text, `magit-with-section' finalizes the section by doing some
things common to all sections.

These final steps are unnecessary for sections that were canceled, and
some commits ago `magit-with-section' has been taught not to perform
them when its BODY set SECTION to nil.  Now finally we actually do set
it to nil.

Not that the ""root"" or ""buffer"" section is never canceled; if its body
is empty the string ""(empty)"" is inserted instead."

Additionally this allows tiding up the code a bit, but we don't do that

override them later.  Besides the removal of `magit-new-section' there

In the ""more commits"" sections created in `magit-refresh-log-buffer' and
`magit-refresh-reflog-buffer' store the same information in the struct
slot TITLE that is already stored in TYPE.  That obviously is wrong but
at least it now is consistently wrong across Magit.  The reason why we
cannot just drop that yet, is that in some places TYPE is used to
retrieve this information, while in others TITLE is used.  It's also
worth noting that in a few other cases INFO is used instead or as yet
another alternative way of accessing this value.

In the section created in `magit-wash-remote-branches-group' store an
identification string in TITLE, instead of that string prefixed with
some irrelevant noise.

After this change all sections either store the same (constant) symbol
in TITLE and TYPE, or they store a symbol in TYPE and either nil (only
buffer sections) or some information in the TITLE slot, which can be
used to uniquely identify the section and/or is necessary when
performing some action on the section.  That value usually is some
string, but it may also be a symbol, it is however in all cases an atom.

The actual TITLEs being changed here are:
* 2x  ""longer""                        =>  'longer
* 1x  (concat ""remote:"" remote-name)  =>  remote-name"

Add a colon at the end of the heading of ""Pending changes"".

After this commit section headings are consistent.  The headings of all
toplevel buffer sections, that actually have a heading, DO NOT end with
a colon.  Those sections that don't have a heading don't do so because
they either start out with a ""line"" subsection.  Or because their
content begins with something that serves well as a heading, and making
that actually a heading would cause complications but no significant
benefit.

The headings of non-buffer, non-line sections, that actually do have a
heading, DO end with a colon.

I would actually like this to be customizable using two distinct format
strings, but that can wait.  It would also be nice if the user could
choose whether the newline should be propertized as part of the heading,
which becomes relevant when the background color is set."

Extend `magit-make-commit-button' so that it not only turns a text area
into a button but at the same time turns it into a magit section.  The
second task was previously performed by `magit-set-section'.  The latter
is removed in this commit.  And so is the noisy code that was previously
required around the calls to these functions - they only ever appeared
in combination.

Now `magit-make-commit-button' is much more useful because it does
everything related to creating a commit button, and could therefor
potentially be used elsewhere.  Actually we should consider whether the
""button as a section"" concept could be used for other things besides
commits.

Regarding the removed `magit-set-section' I have to say this: It is a
colosal failure if a function is advertised as universally useful (here
by its name and placement) even though it is not, AND only has a single
caller (`magit-wash-commit'), FOR WHICH it is COMPLETELY inappropriate,
because it only serves to COMPLICATE that one caller (for which it
presumably was written), AND there already is an existing abstraction
(`magit-make-commit-button') which only has to be modified SLIGHTLY to
ACTUALLY make it easier for the caller."

In some other cases where the call to `magit-set-section-info' was not

This prepares for the eventual removal of the troublesome variable
`magit-top-section'.  Three of the difficulties resulting from the
use of that variable are hinted at here, but there are more.

Add a new argument SECTION to the ARGLIST of `magit-with-section'.
It has to be a symbol and it is bound to the section being created
by `magit-with-section'.

Something similar is done in `magit-section-{action,case}'.

Do not actually make us of the new binding yet.  Except in one case
where not doing so would result in a surprising breakage (diffs can
no longer be expanded).  The main change in this commit is related,
but one would not expect this to break `magit-wash-raw-diff' - but
being predictable is not exactly a property of `magit-top-section'.

It might seem that there are not many uses of `magit-with-section'
that could actually make use of SECTION, because there are not many
that currently use `magit-top-section'.  That however is an illusion
- there are many sections that use it indirectly by calling functions
such as `magit-set-section-info' which do manipulate the section
stored in `magit-top-section', when their optional SECTION argument
is nil (which it always is).  These functions were presumably
created in the first place because having uses of `magit-top-section'
appear everywhere was troubling (or at least noisy) and someone
wanted to hide that fact (effectively obscuring `magit-top-section'
even more)."

The command `magit-bisect-run' is a wrapper around `git bisect run CMD

the user and then pass that on to `git bisect run'.

But until now, after reading the input, it instead stored the user input
in a file, made it executable, called `git bisect run' with that file as
CMD, and then later and somewhere else (this was removed in the previous
commit) removed the file again.  Well, we don't need to do any of that...

Also we now read user input the same way `shell-command' does - if it's
good enough for that, then it is good enough for us too."

This uses the new ""command output cache"" implemented in the previous
commit and replaces `magit--bisect-info-for-status', which was removed
in the commit before that (because it used the old, broken caching
mechanism).

We use a ""real"" section with a heading and a body, instead of a ""line""
section, because while the first line usually contains the interesting
part, that is not always the case.  The body is hidden by default.

The cached output is inserted verbatim in most cases, except when we
*know* the first line does not contain the ""result"".  Currently this the
only covered special case is when the `run` command was run.  In that
case the last line (mentioning the ""first bad commit"") is copied to the
front.  Other special cases can be added as they surface.

If there is no cached information, inform the user about why that is so,
instead of throwing the arms in the air, as the old implementation did."

Both the old and the new implementations dealt with this problem:
`git bisect CMD' does print some useful information, which cannot
be fully retrieved from the .git/BISECT_* files it also generates.

We could reimplement a lot of the `git-bisect' script and `bisect.c' but
that would be overkill.  In most cases the information isn't that
important; but still quite nice to have.  One case where we cannot get
to it is when the user runs `git bisect CMD' from the command line.  In
that case the information is in the shell, and we just cannot get to it
- so be it, the user probably saw it there.

--

This was the setting.
Now comes how the old implementation tried to deal with it:

`magit-run-git-bisect' (formerly known as `magit--bisect-cmd') used
`magit-git-lines' (should have used `magit-git-line') to get the first
line, and stored it in a buffer-local variable in the status buffer.

That's problematic because the user might delete that buffer at any time
in which case we would lose the cached information.  Also the buffer
might not exist in the first place, resulting in an error.

Then it went on throwing everything but the first line away.  In most
cases that is acceptable, but not when an error occurs or when using the
`run' command.

Also because `magit-git-lines' is used instead of some function that
ultimately uses `magit-run*' there is no error handling whatsoever.  If
something goes wrong the user has no choice but to rerun the whole
bisect on the command line, just to find out what went wrong.

Then, probably to deal with some of the above issues, it went on to
reimplement `magit-run*', including its own filter and sentinel, just
for the sake of `magit-bisect-run'.

--

This is what the new implementation does:  Use `magit-run-git*' (which
ultimately uses `magit-run*') like for all other user commands.  Git's
output is placed in the process buffer as usual.  The output is *also*,
and that's the *only* customization actually required, inserted into
the file .git/BISECT_CMD_OUTPUT (using a special filter function).
That's it.

That file is later used when displaying information in the status
buffer. The next commit will actually add the new ""inserter"" function
responsible for doing so."

That information should be displayed separately and the way the

and leaky.  So we remove this first (it is not essential) and
then, in a later commit, add a more suitable substitute.

Remove the function `magit--bisect-info-for-status' which was

Move the ""Refresh Machinery"" section to the toplevel.  Previously it
was a subsection of ""Magit Mode"".  The main reason it was merely a
subsection for a long time, is that moving it to the toplevel did
require some code to be moved around (see previous commits).

The refresh machinery is only loosely coupled with the code related
to the code in ""Magit Mode"".  This move just officializes this, and
was prone to happen eventually.  Since I have plans to improve both
the ""mode"" and the ""refresh"" logic, that moment has come now."

Previously they were located in the ""Refresh Buffer"" section which also

used to ""do a refresh"", the latter for Magit buffers and the moved
functions for file-visiting buffers.  I am consolidating the various
""Magit Mode"" subsections and turning ""Refresh Machinery"" into a toplevel

later be replaced by other functions, which will then be used by the
others.  Never-the-less the definitions the latter functions are the

The last few commits were already preparing for this; here we just make
it final: Do not abuse `magit-format-ref-label', which is supposed to
put nice colors on refs and possibly change their text for display, to
also _filter out_ certain refs.  Performing an additional, completely
unrelated task, made this function unreadable, and required the addition
of several functions and a hook variable.  Remove those that remained
until now.

There is a mechanism dedicated to the filtering of refs:
`magit-list-interesting-refs'.  (That also has issues but that is
a different story).

This isn't perfect yet.  E.g. the involved faces are still named
`magit-log-head-label-{*}'; which isn't good because this, now that
sanity has been restored, could be used elsewhere (but isn't yet).  Also
these faces don't have anything to do with the HEAD, so it makes little
sense that their names contain ""-head-""."

Remove `magit-wip-mode' which was used to give ""refs/wip/BRANCH"" a
special appearance and nothing else; and obviously only in buffers where
it was actually enabled.  Don't confuse it with `magit-wip-save-mode'.

This commit removes the special appearance temporarily, but in a few
commits that will be restored.  Unfortunately this use of the existing
""ref formatting"" code prevents changes to that code, which forces us to
do it like this.

The special appearance won't be restored exactly as it is now: it will
drop the ""(WIP) "" prefix.  No other ""labels"" for other kinds of refs use
such a prefix, and it also isn't necessary, because we already use a
different face to give it distinct look.  Also in a few commits, the
ability for users to add such a prefix using the Custom interface will
be added for all ref namespaces, not just this particular one.  But we
won't use it for any refs by default.

There will also soon be a Custom option that allows hiding certain refs.

By removing this mode we lose the ability to only give ""refs/wip/BRANCH""
a special appearance in certain buffers instead of all.  However it soon
will be possible again to give these refs the fallback appearance by
customizing an option.

I don't really think this is a loose at all: if such refs exist then
that most likely means that the user makes use of `magit-wip' and/or
`git wip'; and would like them to have a special appearance everywhere
or nowhere.  If he doesn't use these tools but uses the namespace for
some other reason and doesn't want them to look any different, then
again he can just customize the option.

If the user does use `*wip' in some repositories and wants them to have
a special appearance there, but also uses refs in the same namespace for
other purposes in other repositories, then he is doing it wrong and we
shouldn't keep the mode just so that he can keep on doing that.  Just
saying, I don't expect anyone actually does that."

This is a somewhat controversial issue.  Some think that simply loading

me think that users should have to do that explicitly.  It might be a
bit annoying that an additional step is required to use the library and
its modes - it would be more annoying to have to do something *not* to
use it.

The argument ""But why would they install it if they did not want to use
it?"" does not apply it - Magit does force Melpa users to install it,
even though `magit-log-edit' could be used instead.  Magit has to ensure
one of the commit modes is installed and does so by making the preferred

after it has been washed.  Once case in which this is useful is when
washing a section properly requires information that isn't available
until another section that textually comes later has been washed.

The BEGINNING marker is initially set to not advance when text is
inserted at the place it points to (or nothing would ever become part
of the section), but once washing is done it is changed to advance."

In `magit-refresh-log-buffer' stop using `magit-rev-range-describe', by

necessary because the errors are not locally contained and over time
have propagated throughout `magit.el'.  One of the mistakes this commit
tries to address is that revision ranges are passed around as cons
cells, which is wrong for several reasons.

This changes the buffer headings for relative-to-worktree/range/stash
diffs from:

  Changes in RANDOM-NAME-FOR-REVISION
  Changes from RANDOM-NAME-FOR-REVISION-A to RANDOM-NAME-FOR-REVISION-B
  Changes from RANDOM-NAME-FOR-stash@{N}^2^ to stash@{N}

  Changes in REVISION-AS-GIVEN-BY-USER
  Changes in REVISION-A-AS-GIVEN-BY-USER..REVISION-B-AS-GIVEN-BY-USER
  Changes in stash@{N}^2^..stash@{N}

That's one small step backward for prettiness, one giant leap forward
for correctness.  Currently Magit cannot tell A..B and A...B apart,
this, and other changes, will eventually make fixing this possible.
And displaying SOME-REF-MATCHING-REV isn't helpful when the user

In `magit-refresh-log-buffer' stop using `magit-rev-range-describe'.
Currently revision ranges are passed around as cons cells, which is
wrong for several reasons.  Because this commit is only one of the
steps required to undo that design error, it does contain a kludge.

This changes the buffer headings for ranged/other logs from:

  Commits in RANDOM-NAME-FOR-REVISION
  Commits from RANDOM-NAME-FOR-REVISION-A to RANDOM-NAME-FOR-REVISION-B

to

  Commits in REVISION-AS-GIVEN-BY-USER
  Commits in REVISION-A-AS-GIVEN-BY-USER..REVISION-B-AS-GIVEN-BY-USER

That's one small step backward for prettiness, one giant leap forward
for correctness.  Currently Magit cannot tell A..B and A...B apart,
this, and other changes, will eventually make fixing this possible.
And displaying SOME-REF-MATCHING-REV isn't helpful when the user
explicitly inserted something like ""HEAD~5""."

that the end of the buffer or narrowed part is reached.  In practice
that means that all callers of `magit-wash-log' have to narrow to the

Add option `magit-item-highlight-face' to once and for all satisfy all
users, hopefully.  Actually, that is not possible; so what this actually
does, is to allow users to customize the appearance of the highlighting
without imposing any limitations.

The previous attempt implemented in at least the commits 66a0644,
d14a3f9 (with discussion), and d14a3f9; and discussed in the issues #743
and #865 failed.  They fixed it for some users and in turn broke it for
others.  The primary goal of this change is to help users help
themselves, in case they don't like the defaults.

The new option `magit-item-highlight-face' is necessary because face
inheritance has serious limitations when a theme is used.  It is not
possible for the user to ""unset"" a face attribute that was previously
set by the theme.  All that is possible is to *change* it to some other
value.  ""Make unset"" isn't available as a value.

This option also makes it possible to automatically set the default of
option `magit-diff-use-overlays' to nil in *one particular* case: when
`magit-item-highlight-face's value is `bold'.  (We previously tried
something similar, but that failed because of another limitation of
faces, :set-after only works for options, not faces).

This commit also changes the appearance of some faces, which might
disappoint some users.  There simply isn't anything we can do to make
this look good out of the box for everyone.  Unfortunately for some
people that will mean that we have switched from a default that worked
for them to one that doesn't.  I hope that, when pointed to this
message, it becomes obvious, that it isn't as easy as one might have
thought, and that we had to make compromises.

The following considerations went into choosing the colors used for
various themes:

* Being at least _usable_ in (hopefully) all cases is more important
  than being _pretty_ in most cases.  We are not in the business of
  designing consistent color themes.

* Inherit from default faces, hoping that doing so, results in
  consistent, semantically sound, and possibly even pretty colors.
  If that is not so that is the mistake of the theme authors.

* The colors red and green, in all its variations, have to be avoided
  because those colors are also used to indicate removed and added lines
  in diffs.

* Therefore inherit from default faces that, in the default theme (both
  the dark and light variant), don't use such colors.  Of course some
  third-party theme might have changed these faces to use red or green;
  we simply cannot do anything about that.

* The faces we inherit from also have to be semantically close to
  ""highlight"".  Which gives us `highlight', `region', and
  `secondary-selection'.

* `region' cannot be used because it is also used for... the region,
  which is useful when staging just a portion of a hunk, precisely *the
  region*.

* `highlight' cannot be used because it is green.

* `secondary-selection' and only that remains.  Use it.  It might not
  be pretty even when using the default theme, but if it is good enough
  for the designers of the default theme then it is good enough for us.
  Besides we don't have another option.

So make `magit-item-highlight' inherit from `secondary-selection' and
make `magit-item-mark' (which previously inherited from the former)
inherit from `highlight'.  It's okay for `magit-item-mark' to be green;
only commits can be marked, and commits don't appear next to added (or
removed, or unmodified) lines."

In most cases this did not happen because there was no such bogus entry
in `window-buffer'.  However when a command did move to some other
buffer and did only then refresh the buffer we ended up with such an
entry.  The entry is created when switching away from the buffer.
Refreshing is done by first erasing the buffer and then rebuilding it
from scratch.  Erasing the buffer causes the markers in the entry to
become invalid and since we have already switched away from the buffer
earlier then rebuilding the buffer contents neither creates a new entry
nor updates the markers in the existing entry.

The old implementation was problematic because it did not use the
existing abstractions used elsewhere and because was very slow (521).
Because of the former issue it was needlessly complicated, while also
lacking features.  And in order to address the latter two different ways
of limiting what branches are displayed were added, again making it more
complex than it needs to be.

Additionally one of these filter mechanisms required that the user
individually marked branches he did not want to be shown.  Because doing
so results in a refresh of the complete buffer this effectively meant
that he, in order to eventually get a speedup, had to repeat the action
which he wants to speedup - several times, adding insult to injury.

This implementation takes a different approach.  Like this is also done
for diff hunks but until now nowhere else, it does not merely hide the
body of collapsed sections, it does not even calculate the commits until
they are actually being displayed.

Unfortunately the section framework has several shortcomings which
result in a lot of complexity in `magit-insert-wazzup-commits'.  In
theory this function could be almost as simple as, lets say,
`magit-insert-unpulled-commits', but as of now it consists of a
collection of kludges.  Fixing the section api to make this unnecessary
is a difficult task and requires changes throughout Magit.  So that will
have to wait until another day.

Because wazzup is much faster now this does not add a new and better
exclude mechanism.  Instead the old mechanisms are dropped without a
replacement.  This can still problematic when a user expands all
sections (e.g. using M-2) but he doing so does not make much sense -
especially not when there are many branches."

`magit-hide-diffs' was used to explicitly tell the code used to insert

However passing this information explicitly is not necessary because we
have implicit knowledge of then it should be hidden: when the section is
only one among other ""top"" sections.  Or in other words when the mode

Most calls to `magit-run*' don't set its NOERASE arg to a non-nil value,
so the process buffer is cleared pretty much every time we run a command

However, sometimes it's useful to be able to refer back to the log
of recent Git commands (and their output), e.g. when cleaning up stale
remote-tracking branches after having fetched with the ""--prune"" flag.

Now we can prevent the process buffer from ever being cleared by setting
`magit-process-keep-history' to a non-nil value. To improve readability,
individual command invocations will be delimited with an empty line.

When a `magit-section' struct represents a `diff' or `diffstat' section
more information has to be stored inside the struct than for other
section types.  Currently this is done by storing a list in the `info'
slot.

They right way to implement this would be to add additional slots to
the `magit-section' struct and just not use them for the other types,
that don't need them.

But because the `info' slot is used to uniquely identify specific
section this is not currently possible.  Doing so would require complex
refactoring elsewhere. I have already attempted to do so, it requires
changes all over the place.

Instead, for now, move the `diff` and `diffstat` specific pseudo slot
getters below the definition of the struct."

So they have been happily clicking on a flashy image to start
Emacs and we come along requiring emacsclient being on $PATH.

But it gets worse.  The emacsclient executable might not even be
located in the same subdirectory of the application directory:

All of the sections created by these inserters are used in the ""status""
buffer.  They can also be used in other Magit buffers but that doesn't
change the fact they are ""status"" sections.

Some of these inserters were defined as part of the ""Status Mode""
toplevel section, while others where defined next to the lowlevel
functions they make use of.  There are two ways to make that
consistent... this commit implements on of them.

Because these inserters can also be used by other Magit modes besides
`magit-status-mode' create a new toplevel section ""Status Sections""
instead of placing inside a subsection of ""Status Mode"".  Actually this
is done by promoting the existing subsection ""Status Mode"">""(sections)""
to a topsection; so the definitions that were already located there do
not have to be moved.

Because after moving `magit-insert-untracked-files' the toplevel section
""Untracked Files"" only contains one function `magit-wash-untracked-files'
move that along with the former (which happens to be its only caller).

The definitions of the inserters are in the same order as the sections
are inserted in the ""status"" buffer.  Unfortunately that means that the
more noisy ones come first.  But that's just because nobody has bothered
cleaning them up yet.

Actually that is not quiet true.  The ""line"" sections are defined after
the ""real"" (multi-line and collapsible) sections.  But that is no

Among other things, commit f6506846 renamed `magit-svn-remote-string'
to `magit-svn-insert-status-remote-line', and added it to
`magit-after-insert-remote-line-hook', intending for it to run after

However, this could never work, since `magit-insert-status-remote-line'
wasn't defined using `magit-define-inserter' meaning the hook wouldn't exist,
and even if did, it would be called `magit-after-insert-STATUS-remote-line-hook'.

As a result, `magit-svn-mode` no longer displayed the ""Remote:"" line.

I would have liked to drop the ""status"" part in `magit-insert-status-remote-line'
(see commit 44abd449), but then I'd have to satisfy my urge to make the same
change(s) in *all* the inserter functions, thereby tainting this branch with
commits that don't belong, so I've opted to adjust `magit-svn-mode' instead.

Choices, choices...

Move the `magit-ref-get-label-color' function and all support functions
and variables into the new ""Reference Labels"" subsection of ""Revision
and Ranges"" (which is also, or mainly about References, but that's a
different story).

The support symbol names of support functions and variables sport the
""log"" substring and indeed the functionality provided by the moved code
is *currently* only used for logs.  However ""colorizing a reference
according to its type"" is also needed elsewhere.  Currently these other
places use different less flexible implementations, but that should be
changed.  So move as a first step toward using this (or rather a
generalized variant thereof) move it to a ""common"" place.

Also move the `magit-log-format-reflog' into the ""Reflog Mode"" section;
*not* to the same place as `magit-ref-get-label-color'!  These functions
do something similar and are both used by `magit-format-log-line' but
they actually are quiet different.

`magit-log-format-reflog' is about colorizing the ""actions"" in reflogs,
not about doing that to references, so it does not belong near code that
deals with references.  It could be left were it was previously defined,
since that is also where the only call to it is located (inside
`magit-format-log-line').  However because it is strictly only related
to reflogs the respective section is the perfect place."

Use the same definition order for all sections in `magit.el' that
contain the definition of a Magit major mode, its refresh function, and
the related entry command(s); and then possibly other things.

  This is something I wanted to do for a long time.  I didn't do so
  because it makes inspecting history more difficult.  But considering
  how much grief the disorder has caused me, messing with the history is
  the lesser evil.

  Also note that I am not switching from one common order to another.
  It appears that there was a common order at some point (which is about
  the opposite of what I am now doing).  But over time that order was
  lost because inconsistent additions were made to the various mode
  sections, effectively destroying the similarity and in some cases also
  making the section very disorganized even when looked at in isolation.

The new prototypical order is this:

1. `magit-*-mode'
2. `magit-*-buffer-name'
3. `magit-INVOCE-*' -- Creates a buffer named (2), puts it in (1) mode
   and refreshes with (4).
4. `magit-refresh-*-buffer'

See the ""Diff Mode"" section for the prototypical example.

  This does not only benefit my own ocd.  The new order also makes it
  easier for readers new to the source.  The doc-string of the mode
  servers as a short summary.  The ""invocation"" commands come next,
  because the have (should have) a useful doc-string, are usually short,
  and the ""refresher"" that follows is often long and not of interest to
  the casual reader.

The lack of a common order didn't just make it harder to read the mode
sections it also lead to inconsistencies.  Some of these could have
prevented with a common order, others probably not.

Also not all of the remaining inconsistencies are actually bad.  Some
are just due to differences in the complexity of these modes.

The implementation of support functionality like washing differ in
complexity between modes and/or are shared between modes.  Depending on
this some of implementation details might be defined in independent
and/or shared sections elsewhere in the file.  In some cases this should
be corrected but that's a different issue.

What is important is that at least the parts that exist for each mode
share the same definition, so that the remaining differences do not
cause to much confusion.

Some mode sections also lexically contain:

0. Additional variables that have to be defined early.
   Many of these variables should be abstracted away.
5. Section inserters used in (4).
6. Washers used in (5).
7. Wacky stuff that needs to be cleaned and generalized because
   it can also be used elsewhere.

Some mode section are now split (or were already split) into
preliminary/temporary sub-sections.  These subsection will likely
disappear after some cleanup.  If they do not they will get better
headings.  I also added some TODO markers which should also be gone
soon."

* Set the parent keymap explicitly in each mode keymap definition,

  than perfect time).

* Add doc-string to all mode keymaps.  Except for `magit-mode-map' use
  what would have been generated by `define-derived-mode'.

* For all modes, add a link to the parent of the modes keymap in the
  mode function doc-string.  Wrap it in a sentence similar to that about
  the parent mode and its which is automatically appended.

* Beyond the above also give the mode doc-strings a uniform form by.
  That form isn't perfect but at least we now have a reasonable summary
  in all mode doc-strings.

* Change the doc-string summary of `magit-mode' to explain that it is
  the parent mode of other Magit modes (which also implies it isn't
  intended for direct use, like `special-mode')."

Since commit f8d304a1, `magit-git-string` *actually* returns only the

fail because it now only gets the first of the three mode/SHA1 pairs it

Instead of re-introducing something like `magit-git-output', which should
also sanitize the output (e.g. trailing newlines), use `magit-git-lines'.

BTW, for some odd reason (which I don't feel like investigating right

Remove the `magit-flow.el' for the time being.  Another
implementation that implements the functionality described at
http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow
will be added at a later time.

This version is removed because it depends on external scripts
that implement this workflow (https://github.com/nvie/gitflow),
which happens to be unmaintained.  It will actually be easier
to rewrite this in directly elisp than wrap around a bugged
external implementation (and eventually having to fork and
maintain that).  Also in most distributions these scripts are
not available through the native package manager.

More importantly though this version has to be removed because
it is very incomplete.  Having this version in the Magit repo
will raise expectations we cannot fulfill at this time; for a
elisp-only implementation to be feasible some existing mess in
the Magit code base has to be cleaned up first, and extenting
the wrapper around the shell scripts would be a waste of time
considering the goal of not relying on these eventually.

See issue #881 for discussion."

When finishing or aborting a commit restore the window configuration
stored in `magit-commit-previous-winconf'.  If that is nil or was
created from a frame different from the current one (most likely
because multiple commits are performed at the same time), do nothing.

The code that invokes the commit (e.g. `magit-commit-internal`) has
to set `magit-commit-previous-winconf' before doing so.  Library
`server' does not feature a hook that could be used for this purpose.

If the previous window configuration cannot be restored (because it
hasn't been stored or does not apply) do what was done before this
commit.  Just kill the buffer and live with the wrong window being
selected after that."

Add a -v option which allows you to invoke git-commit with --verbose. I
always do this because inevitably I'll forget some of the finer points
of the patch I'm about to commit, and having it all in the same buffer
instead of having to look at ""git diff --staged"" in another window is
great.

Now when you press ""c"" the window that's brought up looks like this:

    Switches
     -r: Replace the tip of current branch (--amend)         -a: Stage all modified and deleted files (--all)
     -e: Allow empty commit (--allow-empty)                  -v: Show diff of changes to be committed (--verbose)
     -n: Bypass git hooks (--no-verify)                      -s: Add Signed-off-by line (--signoff)
     -S: Sign using gpg (--gpg-sign)
    Actions
     c: Commit

And e.g. for this change I'm about to commit the buffer opens with:

    # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
    # On branch master

Add preliminary subsections to the top-level sections ""Revisions and
Ranges"", ""Diffs and Hunks"", ""Logs"", and ""Branch Manager Mode"".  Wrap
the headings with parenthesis to indicate their status and also add
comments to that effect.

I have added subsections in the past only after/when rearranging the
containing top-level section.  But because I don't want to do this for
all these sections now I am adding these preliminary subsections now
without at the same time bringing the subsections and the contained
definitions into a reasonable order.

In my cleanup efforts I am currently focusing on removing *other* code
smells.  E.g. by identifying utilities that need to generalized to be
used outside of the scope they were originally written for (and in the
process removing narrow minded simplifications) and removing functions
only used by one caller (because it wouldn't make sense to improve and
then use them elsewhere).

Given my tiny brain it helps when code is stored in little labeled
boxes.  In the past I *have* used such temporary headings like those
being added in this commit.  I just never committed them and that let
to a lot of stashing and other laborious trickery.  Not this time: this
commit gives me a structure to work in and which is to be improved.

So yes, it's ugly and doesn't make for a good first impressions but for
all that it is worth doing so helps me fix the underlying causes of the
disorganization more quickly."

Move the beginning of the ""Commit Mode"" top level section up to include
definitions that were previously part of the ""Logs and Commits"" section.
Rename that to just ""Logs"" as it no longer contains code related to the
commit buffer.  (Having a section that contains both ""log"" and ""commit""
related code didn't make sense in the first place.)

The order of the code inside the extended ""Commit Mode"" section is
unfortunate but we can live with it for a while."

The ""Status Mode"" toplevel section contains various definitions that do
not strictly belong there.  Because there also are no other places that
would make complete sense and defining separate toplevel sections for
these definitions would also not be appropriate they are kept in the
current section.

The hope is that eventually a natural place for these definitions will
evolve.  Until then at least split the misplaced stuff into dedicated
subsections.  This can be done without moving any code around (except
for `magit-init' which was moved in the last commit).

Add a new subsection ""Save File Buffers"".  Because it right in the
middle of the existing ""Status Refresh and Commands"" subsection that is
renamed to ""Status Refresh"" and a new subsection ""Status Commands"" is
added.

Creating new toplevel sections would also be an option but that would
require that code be moved around (because ""Status Commands"" really does
belong in the ""Status Mode"" section).

In summary: ""Save Buffers"" and ""Read Repository"" should not really be
located below ""Status Mode"" but having them their is less bad than the
alternatives."

`magit-mode-setup' calls `magit-display-mode-buffer' to display and
select a buffer and then calls `magit-mode-init' to turn on the mode,
store refresh information and perform the first refresh.

It also makes sure that the arguments to `magit-mode-init' are evaluated
in the correct buffer - that is before switching to the mode buffer.

Local bindings should only be used when they are necessary because e.g.
(a) the value is used more than once and is costly to calculate (because
of either the computation or visual noise) or (b) the value has to be
calculated before its use because doing retrieving the value and using
it in the same place would change the outcome to to due to scope
differences (e.g. a different buffer is current).

When let is used and neither one of these or other requirements call for
it one is left wondering whether that is indeed the case, or whether one
just overlooks some subtle detail.  This cost outweights the benefit of
implicitly documenting the purpose of the function being called with the
local variables as arguments.

This doesn't full apply here, but the implicit ""argument documentation""
argument is very weak in cases like this:

original behavior (""create branch at HEAD"") the default.
See e.g. this thread [1] from February 2013 on the ML.

Instead of making 'at-point the default, let's just get rid of
the option altogether and always try to find a rev at point first.

Note that I'm intentionally *not* using `magit-default-rev', as
that uses `magit-guess-branch', which is very likely to offer

Between the time that branch was created (commit 83dac351) and merged

Also, the function might at some point in the future be changed to do

    the information is taken from the configuration items
    user.name and user.email, or, if not present, system user

The decision to officially the support for older versions of Emacs was
unanimously reached here: https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/708.

Actually the old claim in README.md that Magit works with GNU Emacs 22.1
was wrong.  Some features of Magit *might* have worked with that version
but a lot of things would not have.

Remove some old (and incomplete) backward compatibility definitions.

Since it is possible (while unlikely) that some users have successfully
used Magit with Emacs 22 in the past and because we are removing code
that might previously have allowed using a subset of Magit add a version
check to magit.el.

Check that the minimal version requirement is satisfied; else raise an
error.  It is better to raise an error at this point than to have late
adapters figure out on their own why Magit stopped working with their
beloved ancient Emacs.  I would also rather have people complain about
this decision than having them file bug reports about things that
stopped working - in which case we might fail to notice right away that
the breakage is causes by the use of an older Emacs.

This check will also cause an error when XEmacs is used (as XEmacs isn't
at 23.2 yet, and likely will never be).  The same arguments apply here
than the ones made above regarding old versions of GNU Emacs."

Commits a9ed908a/59fd7f6d removed the majority of our contributors'
copyright statements due to the maintenance overhead involved in
keeping it accurate and up to date.

However, besides being in violation of the GPL, this is rather
discourteous towards our contributors, considering all the time and
effort they've expended to improve Magit for the good of us all.

Also, if left in its current state, it's only a matter of time before
people start adding copyright lines again, and ""who's maintainer"" or
""who committed the most"" are inherently transient metrics, so at some
point in the future, the list would need to be revised again, manually,
in every file, no matter what.

Fortunately, this can be easily solved by directly crediting only a
single entity and consolidating its constituents into an auto-generated
""AUTHORS.md"" file that covers the entire project, allowing us to properly
credit our contributors as well as permanently retiring the Copyright
Cleaner hat.

- - -

I've globally replaced the copyright headers with a copyright statement
crediting ""The Magit Project Developers"" (do note that this is *not*
equivalent to ""copyright assignment"") with the correct copyright year(s),
a pointer to the ""AUTHORS.md"" file, and an ""Author:"" line, of which the
value was procured using:

  for i in *.el ; do
      printf ""%s\n  %s\n\n"" \
          ""${i}"" \
          ""$(git log --pretty=format:'%h : [%ai] %aN <%aE>' -- ""${i}"" \
             | tail -n 1)"" ;
  done

An exception was made for ""magit-wip.el"", which was introduced by
Ryan C. Thompson (commit b877584e) but Jonas Bernoulli coded pretty
much the whole thing (commit 5e2e992b and later).

Files containing code borrowed from other projects (specifically
""magit-blame.el"" and ""magit-compat.el"") now state the relevant
projects' names, URLs and licenses, right below the ""Author:"" line.

The Makefile now contains targets which use git-log(1) to generate an
unabridged list of our contributors' names and email addresses, which
is combined with ""AUTHORS.md.in"" and written to ""AUTHORS.md"", which is
always included when rolling tarballs and installing.

To prevent incomplete/duplicate/outdated/erroneous authors' names and
email addresses, a "".mailmap"" file was created, which is automatically
picked up by git-log(1) when using %aN/%aE instead of %an/%ae.

The only contributors for whom I couldn't find any conclusive info are:
- ""aaa707 <aaa707b@gmail.com>""
- ""acple <silentsphere110@gmail.com>""
- ""rabio <rabiodev@o2.pl>""
...so these are included as-is.

And thus the only maintenance overhead left to keeping this list up to
date is running ""make authors"" and committing the updated ""AUTHORS.md""
file, right before tagging a new release.

Add new variable `magit-emacsclient-executable'.  Its default value is
set by searching for an executable in the same directory the executable
of the running Emacs instance is located in or if it cannot be found
there anywhere on `exec-path'.  This should virtually always return
something usable.  If it doesn't then something is seriously wrong with
the Emacs installation.

We first limit the search to the directory containing the invoked Emacs
executable because multiple Emacs version might be installed and the
emacsclient earliest on the `exec-path' might not be compatible with
the running Emacs.

No longer base the $GIT_EDITOR that is eventually used by Magit when
calling git on $GIT_EDITOR or $EDITOR as set in the environment of the
running Emacs.  Instead of detecting and fixing bad values optained that
way always set $GIT_EDITOR from scratch.

Add alternative code paths to `magit-commit' and `magit-tag' that do not
require a working client/server interaction.  When using tramp and when
no window system is available also use these fallbacks.

This can still be improved a lot.  But at least we are no longer set on
a path that forces us add one kludge after another on top of the
existing kludges.

`magit-interactive-rebase' most likely cannot be implemented without the
use of emacsclient so that command now refuses to run if the client
cannot be used.

Remove `magit-git-editor' in favor of `magit-emacsclient-excecutable'.

Remove option `git-commit-commit-function'.  Instead integrate most
of the functionality previously provided by `git-commit-end-session'
(the default value of the former) directory into `git-commit-commit'.

I can see not good reasons why one would want to disable the default
behavior.  However it might be necessary to perform some *additional*
action.  E.g. when `magit-commit' cannot use emacsclient it needs a
way to tell `git-commit-commit' to actually call `git commit' to that
effect.  The new hook `git-commit-commit-hook' is intended for that
purpose.

`git-commit-end-session' also contained some code wrapping around
variable `server-buffer-clients'.  Since we use that while aborting
too, create a new function `git-commit-buffer-clients' from that part.

`git-commit-abort' now tells the emacsclient to exit with a non-zero
exit status, previously we had to save an empty file to communicate to
git that the user has decided to abort creating a commit.  Thanks to
Dhruva Krishnamurthy who showed me how to do that.

`git-commit-abort' no longer warns that aborting will cause the edited
message to be lost.  The option `git-commit-confirm-abort' that allowed
turning that warning of is removed.  Instead the buffer text is always
saved to the `kill-ring'.  A message is shown in the echo area to inform
the user that this has happened.  This has the additional benefit that
the ""git exited abnormally with code 1."" message is less likely to be
seen by the user."

Instead of depending on git-log(1)'s ""--grep-reflog"" flag (which
was only added in Git v1.8.0 [1]) and potentially doing a whole
bunch of string matching, use git-rev-parse(1) with the @{-N}
construct, which is supported since Git v1.6.2 [2].

As an added benefit, we now return nil instead of an invalid
refname when the previously checked out branch no longer exists.

Enabling the ""-a"" switch in `magit-key-mode-popup-tagging' adds
""--annotate"" to `magit-custom-options', however `magit-tag'
checked for the presence of ""-a"" to decide whether or not to use
`magit-with-git-editor-setup' + `magit-run-git-async'.

As a result, creating an annotated tag by setting the ""-a"" flag in
the tagging popup opened a new frame instead of using the existing
one, and blocked the parent Emacs process.

  saving the commit message file. `magit-log-edit' used git's

* `git-rebase-mode' is the new name of the library previously

`magit-server-window-for-commit' will also be added.

`magit-merge' was only called when `magit-rigid-key-bindings' == t
(does anybody even use that?), in which case `magit-manual-merge'
should have been called instead anyway (see commit dbd213ec).

`magit-merge' now defaults to `magit-manual-merge's behavior, but still
allows to skip editing the log message using the optional arg DO-COMMIT.

The new arg is mainly there to support skipping `magit-log-edit'
programmatically though, since humans will most likely be better off
just tapping ""C-c C-c"" in ""*magit-edit-log*"" instead of having to think
about it in advance.

Prompt the user for the range in the `interactive' forms of

Previously this was not only done outside of the `interactive' form
of these functions but inside of `magit-log'/`magit-log-long' which
are called by the former.

This is wrong for two reasons:

(1) Whenever possible minibuffer input should be read in the
    interactive form.

(2) `magit-log'/`magit-long-log' only ever used the range when
    called by `magit-log-ranged'/`magit-log-long-ranged'.

`magit-log'/`magit-log-long' now take a RANGE as first argument,
replacing the ""ask the user for a range and use that"" switch
previously used.

Since this change affects almost all lines seize the opportunity
and move the ""Logging"" section into the toplevel ""Acting"" section."

anything at all"".  `magit-log-edit' already understands it correctly
""no thanks, I really do want to commit"".

Change this function to behave the same way.  Because this function
used `magit-log-edit' internally the test for an in-progress rebase
can be removed here.  There is some code before the call to

the Vc controlled part of the modeline (and if they do they will notice
and can add it themselves).  On the other hand many people complain
about bad performance and not using this function does improve that.
See issue #573.  We should implement our own ""status in modeline"" hook
function, see issue #240.

We have a mechanism for ""updating buffers that need it"": the refresh
mechanism implemented by the `magit-refresh-*' functions and macros.

Refreshing the modeline on behalf of vc did not make use of that but
instead relied on `magit-update-vc-modeline' being called explicitly.
Now it is refreshed whenever the regular refresh mechanism kicks in,
which can both positive or negative.

Positive because we don't have to identify each place where updating
the modeline would make sense; negative because it is a potentially
costly operation which is now done under circumstances that do not
necessarily call for it.

I will take care of the drawbacks by making this both less costly as
well as optional all together, in later commits.  (This commit already
makes refreshing slightly more efficient because it removes one looping
of the list of buffers.)

The name of this function now doesn't match all it does anymore.
That will also be taken care of."

I do not think having such a function is useless per se but in its
current form it is.

1. I have never actually seen a bug report that looked that it was based
   on the contents of buffer created by it.

2. It was only used in very few places and it appears these places never
   actually cause any errors.  (Actually in the case of `magit-run*'
   errors are less unlikely).

3. For this function to be useful it would have to be used everywhere
   errors can happen.  Doing so would be way to ugly without first
   converting it to a macro and then some.

4. Just writing some versions strings into a buffer and telling the user
   to do something is not particularly useful.  Something using Message
   mode might be, though.

So yes, maybe I will add back something similar, but it has to be
redesigned to be useful at all.  And there are more important things to
do first."

This is about semantics not just about aesthetics.

* (if COND THEN)              =>  (when COND THEN)
* (if (not COND) THEN)        =>  (unless COND THEN)

* (when CONDA (when CONDB THEN))
  =>  (when (and CONDA CONDB) THEN)
* (cond ... (t (when COND THEN)))
  =>  (cond ... (COND THEN))

Please not that I have not inspected every single conditional.
Instead, I have ""only"" looked at matches for ""(if"".  In very few
cases I have not switched to the best conditional because the
surrounding code actually needs more extensive cleanup.

Also I have kept:

* (if COND nil ELSE)
* (if COND THEN nil)

when I felt doing so actually makes it easier to the reader.

However the latter was often used as the last form in functions, and
since in elisp functions always return a value I have in most cases come
to the conclusion that (when|unless COND RETURN-VALUE) is just as easy
to understand.  But when it is not immediately obvious that the return
value of a function is significant I have kept the old form with the nil
THEN or ELSE form.

There is never a good time to do this kind of change.  But now is a less
bad time because I have also moved code around during the past month, so
tools like git-blame will have troubles looking furthur into the past
anyway.

Also see #663."

This macro had semantics very different from `with-temp-buffer', a
name that is to close to that of the latter, and no doc-string.

This could lead to tears, or at least confuse people.  Blinded by the
similarity of the names at least I did not initially see the semantic
difference.

There are multiple ways this could be addressed.  E.g. we could find a
more descriptive name and add a doc-string.  But since this macro is
only used twice it makes more sense to just remove the abstraction and
let the two callers do the necessary work themselves.  I think that in
this case _not_ moving the complexity out of sight actually improves
the readers understanding even though the code becomes a little
longer (especially considering that the abstraction would/was only
used once).

Yet another approach would be to improve `magit-run-git-async's
semantics.  This approach wasn't taken because I wanted to contain the
changes to a small area."

conflate unrelated functions just because they happen to share some
logic.  I guess one could argue that these functions are not completely
unrelated.  Well, it is still much easier (in context of reverting a
commit) to reason about:

than

  (magit-apply-commit commit nil nil t)      ; at HEAD~2

- What does reverting have to do with applying?
- What are these arguments?
After jumping to `magit-apply-commit':
- What the &*&$@# is going on here?
- What does cherry-picking have to do with reverting?
- Could it possibly makes sense for the first two optional arguments

- Since that isn't done anywhere the ""reverting"" code branch contains

Previously when NOERASE was non-nil the output from the previous
`magit-run*' invocation was not removed from the *magit-process*
buffer when calling this function.

The only caller of this function which made use of that argument was
`magit-rewrite-finish-step' (which didn't always use it).

So allso remove `magit-rewrite-finish-step's FIRST-P argument.

Indead, in this case it would make more sense to preserve the previous
output a little longer than in others cases.  On the other hand this is
a kludge which cannot be locally contained.  To keep it would make the
cleanup that follows in the next commits much harder.

(Instead we should make it *always* possible to recover the output of
the last few git invocations.  I would be even better to present that
information in the status buffer, instead of having her resort to the
*magit-run* buffer.  I will address this one way or another eventually.)"

* Add new function `magit-version' which is called late when loading

* Use function `magit-version' in the `Makefile' instead of the old
  messy code used to set the version.

* Improve the `Makefile'.  It doesn't modify itself anymore.  Contains a
  `help' target. etc.  Generally it is much cleaner now.

* Fix and improve `tests/magit-tests.el'.  It now even works when travis
  is under high load.

* Remove `tests/run-tests.el'.  Use `make test'.  Interactive tests will
  come back as a separate make target.

* Remove `magit-pkg.el.in'.  Instead generate `magit-pkg.el' only when
  creating the marmalade tarball.  Elsewhere that file is not
  needed (including melpa).

* Remove `magit.spec.in'.  It is neither used by its original author nor
  the Fedora distribution (anymore).  This file has to be removed
  because it depends on the name of the loaddefs file being `50magit.el'
  and insists on installing it below `/etc`.  That isn't correct for
  many distributions and certainly not when installing Magit manually.
  Once this issues were addressed the spec file did not work anymore.

* Cleanup `.gitignore', `.travis.yml' and `README.md'

* Adapt `INSTALL.md' to above changes.

PS:

* I tried splitting this up into multiple commits but did not succeed.

* When Magit is installed using Melpa `magit-version' still reports the
  ""melpa time-stamp"" as version, not the `git describe --tags' version."

The copyright notices have not been updated in a very long time.  By
now so many people have contributed that it is not feasible anymore
to have a copyright line in `magit.el' for everyone.  Now only current
and former maintainers are listed explicitly in this file.  In other
libraries some non-maintainers who made changes to a particular file
are also listed - including but not limited to the original author.

Right below the now shorter Copyright list is a new link to the list of
all contributors on github.

The header keyword ""Original Author"" is replaced by just ""Author"",
that's how it is commonly done.  All keywords no longer contain
whitespace, but use a dash instead.

Both Phil Jackson and Peter J Weisberg are now listed as former
maintainers.  Peter has been removed from the list of active maintainers
as he hasn't done much lately.  Nicolas Dudebout and I are added to the
list of active maintainers.  That list is sorted by activity.

Appropriate Copyright lines and Author keywords are added to files
besides `magit.el' (partly this is done in an earlier commit).

In `magit-svn.el' and `magit-blame.el' several people have already been
listed that have not made a single commit to those file.  I assume this
is because these files have been ported from other packages and therefor
did not remove anyone.

I have added myself as Author of `magit-wip.el' even though Ryan
C. Thompson wrote the first version, because his version was barely
usable.

If you are unhappy about a change please contact me."

Put the commands that directly map to some git porcelain subcommand
into their own dedicated sections (one per subcommand).

These sections are conceptionally subsections of the new ""Acting""
top-level section, but because there are other unrelated sections
located in between the subcommand (sub)sections there two such sections
are actually required.  The headings ""Acting (1)"" and ""Acting (2)"" are
used for those sections.  Some of the 'subsections of section ""Acting""'
are not neighbors of any other such sections and for that reason are
currently top-level sections.  The headings of these sections have
"" (A)"" as suffix to indicate that the are at least conceptionally part
of the ""Acting"" section.  E.g. ""Diffing (A)"".

For some git porcelain subcommands a ""key-mode"" popup exists.  For
others there is no such popup (yet, in some cases).  To differentiate
these two kinds of Magit->Git mappings the headings eigher have a ""ing""
suffix (e.g. ""Merging"") if a popup exists.  Otherwise they don't have
that suffix (e.g. ""Rebase"")."

Previously it was possible that `magit-process' was not set to nil
even though the process has finished, causing all future calls to
`magit-run*' to fail.

For asynchronous processes this happened when the
`magit-process-client-buffer' got killed while the process was still
running (e.g. because the user killed it).  In this case the sentinel
failed to set `magit-process' to nil before it first tried to write to
the deleted buffer causing an error (which are not raised in sentinels).

Now setting `magit-process' to nil is the first thing done in
`magit-process-sentinel' and additionally an attempt to modify the
buffer is only made if it is live.

For synchronous process this could not happen, except when it receives
input, in which case the process is actually asynchronous but
`magit-run*' waits for it finish before returning.

Use a new sentinel `magit-process-input-sentinel' that sets
`magit-process' to nil in that case to.

Both sentinels now only do anything if the `process-status' is either
`exit' or `signal'.

As an additional precaution `magit-run*' now tries to recover from
causes when even the above failed.  If `magit-process' is non-nil but
has finished don't fail but tell the user to create a bug report.

Thanks to @acple and @daimrod, for pointing me into the right
direction."

The macro `magit-with-refresh' cannot be defined in the same place as
the ""refresh"" functions it makes use of because these definitions come
after `magit-with-refresh' is used for the first time.

While this macro is important and used a lot it is not significant to
deserve its own top-level section, so move it into the ""Utilities""

before its first use.  (I don't expect it to make sense to define a

Ensure that only the command, for which the (global) value of
`magit-custom-options' was set inside a dynamic binding, can see that
value by (again dynamically) binding it to nil before refreshing other
buffers (some of which might make use of that option during a refresh).

We cannot make this variable buffer local because that would collide
with other leaky abstractions.  E.g. the buffer whose value we would
want to use is not actually current anymore when the command is
called (see `magit-key-mode-command').

The change to `magit-log-long' is not actually required, and does not
even have any visible effect.  Before entering this rabbit hole I had
hopes that this change would fix the issue.  I keep it for consistency
with all other places where `magit-custom-options' is integrated into
some bigger list: they all use `append', so stop using `nconc' here.

Uff.  This fixes #633."

The copyright notices have not been updated in a very long time.  By now
so many people have contributed that it is not feasible anymore to have
a Copyright line in `magit.el' for everyone.  Now only people who have
made a fair amount of contributions are listed there.  These lines are
sorted by appearance.

Right below the now shorter Copyright list is a new link to the list of
all contributors on github.

The header keyword ""Original Author"" is replaced by just ""Author"",
that's how it is commonly done.  All keywords no longer contain
whitespace, but use a dash instead.

Both Phil Jackson and Peter J Weisberg are now listed as former
maintainers.  Peter has been removed from the list of active maintainers
as he hasn't done much lately.  Nicolas Dudebout and I are added to the
list active maintainers.  That list is sorted by activity.

Appropriate Copyright lines and Author keywords are added to files
besides `magit.el' (partly this is done in an earlier commit).

In `magit-svn.el' and `magit-blame.el' several people have already been
listed that have not made a single commit to those file.  I assume this
is because these files have been ported from other packages and therefor
did not remove anyone.

I have added myself as Author of `magit-wip.el' even though Ryan
C. Thompson wrote the first version, because his version was barely
usable.

We had serious problems running tests on travis.  This commit addresses
these issues and also makes the tests much more readable.

One test was removed in the process.  But as far as I can tell that test
ended up testing functions from Emacs not Magit.  After that removal one
test remained which requires library `mocker'.  It is rewritten to
simply use `flet'.  We don't need mocker anymore."

For every key-mode popup command there is now a corresponding section by
the same name.  These headings consist of one word ending with ""-ing"".

There are a few other sections ending with ""-ing"" (Rebasing, Resetting,
Diffing, and Grepping) but at least for some of these we might actually
want to create new key-mode popup commands.

I would like to eventually put all ""-ing"" sections under a common super
section but that is currently not possible because a few other sections
are mixed inbetween that aren't related to key-mode popups.

For some other sections it would also make sense for them to be nested
below another section.  Again it is not reasonable to do this now
because these sections are not next to each other.

A few of the new sections (ChangeLog, Extensions, Interactive Rebase,
and Interactive Resolve) contain but one or two functions.  In case of
ChangeLog the reason is that its function is missplaced.  In the other
cases this is because the were part of the Miscellaneous section which
also contained other things that should be defined in top-level
sections."

`magit-section-case' used to return t if a clause succeeds but the

`run-hook-with-args-until-sucess' to detect that a clause and therefor
the hook function succeeded.  However, while it was documented in the

* `magit-section-case' and `magit-section-action' always return
  the value of the BODY now.  In other words they can return nil.
* `magit-section-case' doesn't need to know about OPCODE.
  Running the OPCODE hook is done in `magit-section-action' now.

Since our faces have to make sense when using the default theme we have
no choice but to use some other face attribute for `magit-item-highlight',

The problem with my original patch wasn't (just) that I forgot to
account for the possibility of the second argument unintentionally
containing format parameter but that using it as a format string was
wrong altogether.

`magit-insert-status-line' now takes exactly two arguments the HEADING
and the INFO-STRING and inserts both literally without processing them
using `format' first.

There was _one_ instance where we could previously write
  (magit-insert-status-line ""heading"" ""%s %s"" (a) (b))
and now have to write
  (magit-insert-status-line ""heading"" (concat (a) "" "" (b)))

If there were more instances like this then using the second argument
format string _might_ be justified (more likely not: it still makes it
harder to understand `magit-insert-status-line' without actually
thinking).  As it stands using a format string just obfuscates the
functions usage, which goes against the initial motivation of making the
code easier to read pleasing to the eye.

Furthermore if we need to document this function's use despite it being
very simple then there is something wrong with it.  Now a doc-string is
not necessary anymore, because I removed the initial ""design"" error and
use more descriptive argument lines."

Actually this new doc-string - for the bigger part - would have been
correct even before these changes since most of them are actually

the old one :-)

No longer say that in certain cases something ""hairy"" is done when
that behaviour is well defined in git-push(1) and also reasonable.
Instead explicitly say what is done (pushing to the remote branch
with the same name as the local branch) and under what conditions.

I think the new doc-string is much easier to understand.  For better
readability I removed the instructions how prefix arguments are used;
the user has to get that knowledge elsewhere.  Not every command that
supports prefix arguments documents that basics of their use; why
should this one be different?"

The current logic for inserting the header after determining header-at
is riddled with bugs.  Most significantly, it completely omits the case
when header-at is at end-of-line (which happens when your buffer is not
terminated with a newline).  Also, the logic for looking for an existing
pseudo-header is completely bogus: it just looks for a line with the
character ':'.

Redo the entire logic in a dedicated function.  This function uses
git-commit-known-pseudo-headers to find existing pseudo headers
correctly and can return either zero, one, or two newlines.  Its logic
is flawless, as it considers every corner case.

Further, this is unnecessarily convoluted as there is no need to look

6fad2b11 (introduce commit filed for GPG signature, 2013-03-17)
introduced magit-log-edit-toggle-gpgsign and bound it to ""C-c C-S"",
without realizing that it's equivalent to ""C-c C-s"", the keybinding
for magit-log-edit-toggle-signoff.  As a result, it's impossible to
toggle signoff with a keybinding now.  Fix this by changing the
keybinding for toggling gpgsign to ""C-c C-v"".

`magit-section-case' used to return t if a clause succeeds but the
value of it's body is nil.  This was due to internal needs; it allowed
`run-hook-with-args-until-sucess' to detect that a clause and therefor
the hook function succeeded.  However, while it was documented in the
doc-string, callers should not have to deal with this.

* `magit-section-case' and `magit-section-action' always return
  the value of the BODY now.  In other words they can return nil.
* `magit-section-case' doesn't need to know about OPCODE.
  Running the OPCODE hook is done in `magit-section-action' now.
* `magit-add-section' wrap each BODY so that `magit-section-action'
  can detect whether a CLAUSE succeeded.  Previously that was done
  in `magit-section-case' for *any* CLAUSE.
* Disallow a t/otherwise CLAUSE in `magit-section-action' as that
  would prevent the OPCODE hook from running.
* Replace uses of `magit-section-action' without OPCODE to use
  `magit-section-case' instead."

Actually this new doc-string - for the bigger part - would have been
correct even before these changes since most of them are actually
bugfixes.  So the new doc-string wouldn't have been more wrong than
the old one :-)

No longer say that in certain cases something ""hairy"" is done when
that behaviour is well defined in git-push(1) and also reasonable.
Instead explicitly say what is done (pushing to the remote branch
with the same name as the local branch) and under what conditions.

I think the new doc-string is much easier to understand.  For better
readability I removed the instructions how prefix arguments are used;
the user has to get that knowledge elsewhere.  Not every command that
supports prefix arguments documents that basics of their use; why
should this one be different?"

but since all callers expect a match this is not strictly unnecessary
at the moment.  Also some other magit-read-* functions could benefit
from a similar change."

completing-read does allow the user to exit with null input, leaving
it to the caller to handle that case.  Possible options would be to
use some default value or raise an error.

Since magit-builtin-completing-read is a convenience wrapper for
completing-read it seems reasonable to do the latter here so that not
every caller of magit-completing-read has to do this on it's own.

A similar change is not required for magit-iswitchb-completing-read
and magit-ido-completing-read; they already don't allow the user to
exit with a null value."

The branch specified by the former is only meaningful when pushing to
the remote specified by the latter.  When pushing to another remote

remote branch with the same name as the local branch being pushed is
much more reasonable than pushing to branch.b.merge which could be
anything.  This is also how ""git push <remote> <branch>"" behaves."

Currently, `magit-log-edit-commit' erases and buries the commit log buffer, then
proceeds to do things that rely on the `magit-git-dir'.  This function isn't
going to work as expected unless the buffer that is current after `bury-buffer'
is located under the `magit-git-dir' -- but there is no guarantee of that.
Indeed there is no guarantee that any such buffers exist (they may all have been
deleted).  Given the semantics of `bury-buffer' it is sheer luck if you end
up in the right place, and it is quite likely that `magit-git-dir' will simply
crash.

The solution is to record the *magit* buffer itself (not its name, the buffer
itself) in a variable local to the commit log buffer, so that it is guaranteed
that we always have a suitable buffer to switch back to even if it's been
killed, then switch back to it at `magit-log-edit-commit' time.

Rebase mode becomes unusable if a function in `before-save-hook`
throws an error.  This could happen, for example, with
`delete-trailing-whitespace`, since the buffer is read-only.

By doing this in a hook function instead of directly, we make it easy
for the user to stop it from happening if they know what they're doing
and they have a `before-save-hook` that really makes sense in the
context of rebase-mode.

This is intended as a cleaner way of solving the same bug as

Previous version of `magit-log-edit' had two issues:
1. It didn't support splitting of commits, for example, here's the
workflow in question:

C-c g some-git-repo
M-x magit-interactive-rebase (to some old to be splitted commit)
<edit ""git-rebase-todo"" file, mark aforementioned commit to be edited>
x HEAD^

or, just for clarity's sake, its command-line equivalent:

cd some git-repo
git rebase -i <some old to be splitted commit>
<edit ""git-rebase-todo"" file, mark aforementioned commit to be edited>
git reset HEAD^

When then `magit-log-edit' was called in the middle of the ongoing
rebase, by typing ""c"" in the status buffer it would suggest to
continue it(rebase) and exit silently on user's refusal to do so. If
you were to answer ""yes"" to the proposal magit would try to continue
the rebase, fail miserably at said task and stop. So, it is easy to see
that after not so long a struggle you would find yourself in a Catch-22
type of a situation:
 - You need to commit changes in order to continue the rebase
 - You need to finish rebase in order to commit anything

New version addresses that problem by always ignoring ongoing rebase
and performing commit if the repository is dirty. And suggesting to
continue the rebase only if it is clean.

2. It somewhat ignored user's refusal to commit all unstaged changes
or stage them all and then commit. The code in the old version of the
function would still call `(magit-pop-to-log-edit ""commit"")' even if
user answered ""no"" to the asked questions.

This version hopefully addresses that too."

this change is to make `k` more similar to the other keys that change
the action of a line.

At some point in the future we may want to provide a keybinding that
really does ""kill"" a line.  (In fact, that function should probably
end up with the name ""rebase-mode-kill-line"".)  For now I think this
is the more friendly functionality for the `k` key."

When attempting to delete a remote-tracking branch and the associated
remote branch with `k` in the branch manager, the code prior to this
change would:
1) Delete the branch at point.
2) Refresh the buffer as a side effect of calling Git.
3) Delete the remote branch referred to by the branch at point.

Of course, the branch at point in #3 is NOT the same branch that was
at point when the user pressed `k`.  I introduced this bug when I
taught the branch manager's buffer how to respond to magit-refresh.

To fix it, I capture the branch information in a variable before
making any changes, and use that variable instead of any *-at-point
functions.  I also don't change anything until after asking the user
if he wants to remove the remote branch as well, so the selected
branch is still visible when the question is asked."

Commit cd4f15f314cfaa74 had the perfectly valid intention to prevent
magit-rewrite-start from writing parentless commits.

Yet as an unfortunate side-effect, rewrite and rebase (""r"" and ""R""
respectively) now behave inconsistently: while rebasing starts at
REV (as would be expected), rewriting starts at REV~1 (rather
counter-intuitive).

This does not bode well for cherry-picking onto a public repo either.

The manpage states correctly that the base commit is included in the
rewrite operation:

>> Typing `r s' will start a rewrite operation.  You will be prompted
>> for a _base_ commit, and all commits between the current head and
>> this commit are put in a list of _Pending commits_ (including the
>> base commit).  The current head will then be reset to the parent of
>> the base commit.

But since the starting point is explicitly called a ""_base_ commit"" (I
imagine most people think about a base as something to build *upon*,
not *below*), something's due for revision."

Rationale: An interrupted rebase (due to conflicts) will cause git to
open the editor so that the user can change the commit message when
the user continues the rebase (""R c"" in magit). If the editor invoked
by Git is emacsclient then it is highly likely that the same Emacs
instance running magit is also used by emacsclient.

So far git has been running synchronously from
magit-rebase-step. Unfortunately this causes emacsclient to hang as
well."

complete because of a conflict.

I'm guessing about the meanings of .git/rebase-apply/next and /last here: I
haven't found any docs that supports my assumptions, so these could be wrong

Fix the bug in magit-rebase-info that I introduced in 81bb2ba. Here's
the description of the bug from a message of mine to the mailing list:

    I sent an incomplete fix for the ""R"" rebase method recently:

       http://github.com/philjackson/magit/pull/59

    But Phil pulled it in as-is:

       http://github.com/philjackson/magit/commit/81bb2ba2d32fb3bbbc2baaba60b492afe372d831

    Anyway, it needs a small fixup, this:

       (length (magit-file-lines "".git/rebase-merge/git-rebase-todo.backup""))

    Will be way off, because it'll count the (length) of lines like:

       (""pick cb925f0 check message..."" ""pick 2f811b6 take done length""
    ""pick 29332e6 use backup"" """" ""# Rebase 19e2dd7..29332e6 onto 19e2dd7""
    ""#"" ...

    What it should do instead so we can get the correct count is to only
    count up until the """" (uninclusive) so the above example would return
    3.

    I couldn't find an idiomatic way of doing this in elisp, I could with
    the (loop) macro, but that'd require cl.el.

As it turns out magit already needs cl.el, so I can just use (loop) to
fix this.

Hi,

this patch improves documentation of minor modes. Notably it includes
the keymaps so that C-h m shows them depending on the mode.

Hi,

with

xterm -bg black -fg white

the graph shown with M-x magit-log RET can not be seen. Since the
color is so dark I guess emacs ends up using black text on black
background.

The attached patch makes the color a little bit lighter so that it is
visible. I tested this for regressions on X and non-X setups with
several different background colors.

Subject: [PATCH] Make face of the graph of log output lighter on dark backgrounds.

This has been tested in the following configurations:

1) xterm -bg black -fg white
2) xterm -bg white -fg black
3) xterm -bg grey -fg black
4) emacs
5) emass -rv"

As discussed in http://groups.google.com/group/magit/t/6a302dc5cdc05d42,
this remodels the extension API with an eye towards using existing Emacs
extension points (such as hooks and keymaps) directly, rather than
abstracting them through an additional layer.

This will also hopefully make it easier for users to do their own
customization without making a full-fledged extension."

This patch removes the runtime dependences on the cl package.
Luckily, there weren't too many of these.

From the GNU emacs lisp manual (Appendix D.1 coding conventions)

   * Please don't require the `cl' package of Common Lisp extensions
     at run time.  Use of this package is optional, and it is not part
     of the standard Emacs namespace.  If your package loads `cl' at
     run time, that could cause name clashes for users who don't use
     that package.

     However, there is no problem with using the `cl' package at
     compile time, with `(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))'.  That's
     sufficient for using the macros in the `cl' package, because the
     compiler expands them before generating the byte-code.

There's also the small matter that many of the function implementations
in cl, striving for the full generality of Common Lisp (much of which
is completely useless in Emacs), turn out to be horrible.

E.g., for a fun time, dig down through

      (find-if pred list :from-end t),

and look at what it ACTUALLY does when you finish macroexpanding
everything.  It tests *every* element of the list against the
predicate, not just the rightmost ones stopping when it finds the
first match.  Once it determines the rightmost match, it then retains
NOT the element itself, but its *ordinal* position N, which then gets
used in (elt list N), meaning ANOTHER listwalk, just to get the
element back in order to return it.  Nor is the byte-compiler anywhere
near smart enough to optimize this away (I'm not sure *any* compiler
would be...)

I'll grant cl has some useful macros in it, but it comes bundled with a
lot of crap and you need to be really careful about what you use.  For
many things, you're better off rolling your own functionality using
the standard routines available (e.g., while, mapcar, and reverse are
all written directly in C).

And you most definitely do NOT want to be foisting the crap on
everybody else, hence the need to keep it out of the runtime.

Meanwhile, here's The Patch:

	Modified magit.el"
wrog,2010-04-26 23:38:15,https://api.github.com/repos/magit/magit/git/commits/cf60063e3bc55442a0c39612113c45219592c083,cf60063e3bc55442a0c39612113c45219592c083,"*magit-FOO-log* / introduce buffer name variables

Introduces

  magit-log-buffer-name 	*magit-log*
  magit-log-edit-buffer-name	*magit-edit-log*  (was *magit-log-edit*)
  magit-log-grep-buffer-name	*magit-grep-log*  (was *magit-log-grep*)
  magit-process-buffer-name 	*magit-process*
  magit-commit-buffer-name 	*magit-commit*
  magit-stash-buffer-name	*magit-stash*

Also adds C-c C-] as a binding for magit-log-edit-cancel-log-message
since C-c C-] as the aborting counterpart to C-c C-c is at least a
vague convention for other modes (cf. rmail, vm, query-replace...)

Motives:

It annoys me that, when wanting to switch to the *magit-log* buffer
from some random place, I can't type *ma<space>-l<space> and have it
complete properly, at least not if I've previously ever done a commit
(because there's then a *magit-log-edit* out there stealing the
completion).

Also looks like if I ever use magit-log-grep, I will be likewise
screwed.

Finally, it disturbs my sense of aesthetics when I look at source code
and see the same strings occuring over and over.  Usually, that's
crying defvars/defconsts.  (And this will also makes life easier
in the event you don't like my buffer name changes for -log-edit
and -log-grep).

 - -

(...This all leaves *magit-tmp* as the only remaining case of a buffer
    name string occurring multiple times, but that needs to be handled
    differently, so that'll be a different patch...)

(...Note that having buffer names as variables also allows the
    eventual possibility of making them local --- or at least the
    option thereof --- so that one can be visiting several
    repositories at once and not having these buffers all clobbering
    each other.  There's a tradeoff here in that some folks may find
    it confusing/annoying to have more than one set of these buffers
    to deal with,... hence option.

    *If* one is going to go that route, current gut feeling is buffer
    name variables should be local to *just* the status buffer(s),
    void elsewhere, and anything needing one of the auxiliary buffers
    should dispatch through its own status buffer to get what it
    wants.  That way, we're not having to repeat/update/copy
    per-repository definitions everywhere....)

This is different from regular stashing because there is no prompting for a
name, and the stash is immediately re-applied.  It's just a way of taking a
quick snapshot of your working tree, so you can come back to later if need
be.

For example, if you had just made a lot of changes to your project, and then
needed to make another sweeping change before you could commit again, this
would let you safely store your changes without having to resort to a branch."
