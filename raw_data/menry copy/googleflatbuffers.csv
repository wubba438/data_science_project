* [FlexBuffers][Java] Implementation of FlexBuffers API

This is the initial attemp to implement FlexBuffer on Java.

There is some limitations as compared to the C++ implementation:
  1 - No mutations implemented yet
  2 - Does not parse from json

Also, this initial implementation is not focused and performance, but
get the basics write. So there is many opportunities for optimization, for instance,
remove all enums, return CharSequence instead of Strings and object pooling.

* [FlexBuffers][Java] Optimizations and simplification of the Builder  API.

This change removes BitWidth enum in favor of static ints. Also
make all ""reads"" APIs closer to C++ implementation (try to cast or convert
as much as possible, assuming user knows what he is doing). Finally,
we remove the helper classes for building vectors and maps.

There is no official benchmarks, but the unit tests are running in less
than 50% for previous runs, which mean those optimizations are worth it.

* [FlexBuffers][Java] Fix Reference::asString behavior

There was a incorrect assumption that strings would be null-terminated, which
could lead to truncated strings. S now it relies size instead of null-termination.

the Pack/Unpack functions defined in its metatable.

uses a timer function that randomly picks a layout for each iteration.

* Unify Rust test suites for x86 and MIPS builds.

Note that I had to add four extra packages to the MIPS `Dockerfile`:
`libexpat1`, `libmagic1`, `libmpdec2`, and `libreadline7`. For a reason
I couldn't identify, even the simplest Rust MIPS binaries run with
`qemu-mips` would fail with a segfault when run through this
`Dockerfile`. After installing the `gdb-multiarch` package to attempt to
debug the issue, the binaries ran successfully. I pared down the
packages installed by `gdb-multiarch`, and these four packages are the
minimum subset necessary to get Rust MIPS binaries running under
`qemu-mips`.

* Changed Rust tests to use `Vector`s instead of direct-slice-access.

The direct-slice-access method is not available on big-endian targets,
but `flatbuffers::Vector`s provide an array interface that is available
on all platforms.

* Resolved FooStruct endianness issues using explicit struct constructor.

This more closely resembles how FlatBuffers structs are constructed in
generated Rust code.

* Added explanation of how `FooStruct` parallels generated struct code.

Also collected duplicate implementations of `FooStruct` into a common
location."

In flatbuffers, build_defs.bzl has been updated to have the
bazel rule `flatbuffer_cc_library` defined. Therefore, it should
be possible to build another application and using `flatbuffer_cc_library`
directly (by `load(""@com_github_google_flatbuffers//:build_defs.bzl"", ""flatbuffer_cc_library"")`)

However, when I tried to do the above, I saw the following errors in bazel:
```
ERROR: /root/.cache/bazel/_bazel_root/c27e9809996ce9a9c0ed8dd79ef0897b/external/arrow/BUILD.bazel:12:1: in deps attribute of cc_library rule @arrow//:arrow_format: target '@arrow//:runtime_cc' does not exist. Since this rule was created by the macro 'flatbuffer_cc_library', the error might have been caused by the macro implementation in /root/.cache/bazel/_bazel_root/c27e9809996ce9a9c0ed8dd79ef0897b/external/com_github_google_flatbuffers/build_defs.bzl:216:16
```

The reason for the bazel error was that `//:runtime_cc` and `//:flatc` does not have
the repo name prefixed.

By prefix `` the above bazel build error could be resolved.

This fix should help other programs to use flatbuffers directly through bazel.

only used within idl_parser.cpp.  Therefore the definitions can stay in
idl_parser.cpp as well.  Only care must be taken that the definitions

armeabi support was removed from the Android NDK so we should no

commit also re-enables Travis Android builds.

While re-enabling Android builds, some recent changes broke C++98
support so this fixes those issues as well which include:
- Conditionally compiling use of move constructors, operators and
  std::move.
- Changing sample to use flatbuffers::unique_ptr rather than
  std::unique_ptr.

Finally, added the special ""default_ptr_type"" value for the
""cpp_ptr_type"" attribute.  This expands to the value passed to
the ""--cpp-ptr-type"" argument of flatc."

This is a port of FlatBuffers to Rust. It provides code generation and a
runtime library derived from the C++ implementation. It utilizes the
Rust type system to provide safe and fast traversal of FlatBuffers data.

There are 188 tests, including many fuzz tests of roundtrips for various
serialization scenarios. Initial benchmarks indicate that the canonical
example payload can be written in ~700ns, and traversed in ~100ns.

Rustaceans may be interested in the Follow, Push, and SafeSliceAccess
traits. These traits lift traversals, reads, writes, and slice accesses
into the type system, providing abstraction with no runtime penalty."

Before, the verifier would create pointers to objects, and then
verify they are inside the buffer. But since even constructing pointers
that are outside a valid allocation is Undefinied Behavior in C++, this
can trigger UBSAN (with -fsanitize=pointer-overflow).

Now instead the bounds checking is first performed using offsets
before pointers are even created.

Current comment is a bit ambiguous. Default values can be read either if field is not written (like in table), or if they are written explicitly by client but not serialized due to optimization. Impression from current comment is that all the default values which are coming during read are from binaries when we turn-on Force-Defaults. However, that will be a wrong interpretation.

Force_Defaults = true ensures to turn OFF later optimization. In case a field is not written, during read we will get default values but they will still not be serialized."

* Add suppport for ES6 style exports

Adds support for ECMAScript 6 module exports during Javascript
generation. This is useful as many development projects are
switching to this new standard and away from custom module
solutions. By integrating support into flatbuffers, users
do not need to perform additional post-processing of generated
files in order to use flatbuffers output directly in their
codebases.

Reference to ECMAScript 6 modules:
https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-exports

Changes:
* Added `--es6-js-export` option to cli parser tool
* Added conditional code to generate a ES6 style export
  line, replacing the normal NodeJS/RequireJS line.

* Fixed missing export statements

Added exports for definition and struct names that were not inside namespaces

* Updated Compiler.md with new generator option

Added entry to Compiler.md in docs for the `--es6-js-export` flag, including a brief description of the effects and usefulness."

This is to not need static variables, which could trip up users
with destruction order problems.

This potentially makes these operations slightly slower, but I
think they're infrequent enough that this should not be noticable.

Also there is one breaking API change, for a method that is not
used by any code in FlatBuffers and is assumed to affect very
few if any users. A namechange and comment ensures that those
affected, if any, will not run into trouble silently.

Fix for the issue #4744: Ambiguous side-effect execution on vector_downward::make_space() method.
C++ does not impose evaluation order on the two expressions on the right side of the assignment, so compiler can freely decide. As ensure_space() method can change the value of ""cur_"" variable, the result of the subtraction may be different depending on the evaluation order, which is ambiguous in C++.
In order to make this code deterministic and correct, cur_ must be evaluated after ensure_space() is called."

Per the docs https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Error.html an Error is a serious problem that applications should not attempt to catch such as ThreadDeath.  In this case, it is reasonable for a consumer to try to catch this error as it likely indicates a problem with the underlying data. (#4630)

As Error does not inherit from Exception, a generic `catch(Exception ex)` will not catch this error.

A simple change from `Error` to `Exception` is not sufficient as an `Exception` is checked by the compiler, so in order to keep this issue unchecked, I am proposing raising a `RuntimeException` which is not checked, but is still a subclass of `Exception`.

The only possible breaking change would be if a consumer was explicitly catching `Error` already for this library.

Previously, FlatBufferBuilder used 3 resizable buffers:
- serialization (vector_downward)
- field offsets (std::vector)
- vtable offsets (std::vector)

Since the serialization buffer grows downwards, the bottom part of
it can be used as a ""scratchpad"" storage for the other two. Since
field offsets are only accumulated during table construction, and
vtable offsets only after table construction, the two can trivially
share the same storage.

Not only does this reduce the amount of allocation, it also removes
the bulk of std::vector usage from FlatBufferBuilder which was
the #1 cause of slow-down in debug mode, see e.g.:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36085285/any-way-to-improve-flatbuffer-performance-in-debug-c-msvc

Use a combination of travis and twine to publish to PyPI. New
publications will be made:

* When `master` is updated. This will trigger the publication of a
  the Python artifact versioned an iso-compliant build datetime. In this
  way, the cutting edge version will always be available via PyPI.
* When a new git tag is pushed. Tag pushes trigger the publication of
  a python artifact with the same version as the git tag, with the
  leading `v` stripped if present (`v1.2.3` becomes `1.2.3`).

Publications rely on Travis having a PYPI_PASSWORD environment set in
the project settings. See the Travis CI documentation for information on
[setting environment variables which containing sensitive data][1]. Make
extra sure the ""Display value in build log"" switch is OFF.

In addition to setting the previously mentioned `PYPI_PASSWORD`
environment variable, the owner of the PyPI `flatbuffers` repository
should, after merging this commit into master, add his own commit to
change `mikeholler` in `.travis/deploy-python.sh` to his username. It's
also recommended that the owner of `flatbuffers` use a separate account
in the unlikely event that the environment variable somehow becomes
compromised. Again, this is very unlikely, since the environment
variable is only set for ""safe"" builds approved by maintainers (not on
random pull requests).

* Added internal - limited - implementation of flatbuffers::unique_ptr
  for STLs that don't ship with std::unique_ptr.  In C++11 and beyond
  this is just an alias for std::unique_ptr.
* Aliased used type traits structs is_scalar is_floating_point is_unsigned
  into flatbuffers namespace so they can be replaced in C++98 implementations.
  Right now these point at stlport's TR1 implementations.
* Wrapped vector::data() in vector_data().
* Wrapped vector::emplace_back() in vector_emplace_back().
* Wrapper string::back() in string_back().
* Added variants of FlatBufferBuilder::CreateVector() and
  FlatBufferBuilder::CreateVectorOfStructs() that allow the use of plain
  function pointers.
  Generated code has also been modified to use plain functions to build objects
  rather than std::function() so all generated code will work in C++98
  applications.
* Added flexbuffers::Builder::Vector(), flexbuffers::Builder::TypedVector()
  and flexbuffers::Builder::Map() methods that allow the use of plain function
  pointers.
* Changed Parser to internally use plain function pointers when parsing table
  and vector delimiters.
* Added specializations of NumToString() for 64-bit types that aren't supported
  by stringstream in stlport.
* Overloaded numeric_limits for 64-bit types not supported by stlport.
* Replaced build_apk.sh (which was broken by deprecation of the
  ""android"" tool in the Android SDK) with build.gradle and the
  appropriate gradle wrapper to build an APK.
* Switched Android build to build against all STL variants.
* Updated travis configuration to build Android test and sample.

Tested:
* Verified all tests continue to work on Linux, OSX and Android.
* Verified Travis build is green.

* Don't fail the build on unused parameters

gRPC headers have unused parameters so this breaks the test build.

* Pull in updated compiler files from gRPC

There have been some API breaks in gRPC lately. This commit
pulls in the most recent version of the files in this repo
that are just copied from gRPC.

* Modify the gRPC files so that they can work with Flatbuffers

The files taken from gRPC do not work out-of-the-box with Flatbuffers.
This commit modifies them so that they work. Hopefully this commit
will be able to serve as a guide or maybe even be cherry-picked on
top of new versions of those files as newer versions from gRPC are
pulled in.

* Adjust the rest of Flatbuffers to work with the new gRPC

* Change idl_gen_grpc.cpp to work with the new API
* Add missing #include in flatbuffers/grpc.h
* Run tests/generate_code.sh and check in the results
* Don't link with grpc++_unsecure and (secure) grpc. That's just weird

* Revert unrelated JS/TS test changes

* Simplify compiler/config.h

There is no need to import this file from gRPC. In fact, it probably
makes sense to not do so, since it seems to be intended to have
project specific configuration in it.

* Don't emit C++ types in the Go gRPC code generator

* Don't emit C++ #includes in generated gRPC code

Before this PR, there was a Go-specific additional_includes method
in schema_interface.h, which is shared with the gRPC repo. The
additional parameter to FlatBufFile in idl_gen_grpc.cpp makes that
unnecessary, which means we need less Flatbuffer-specific changes
in gRPC."

Zero offsets are non-sensical in FlatBuffers (since offsets are
relative to themselves) but were allowed by the verifier. This could
cause buffers made up of all zeroes to be interpreted as correct
buffers with an empty root object.

Generally, not allowing such offsets will make the verifier more
likely to catch problems earlier.

* fix bounds checking on integer parsing

the previous code was allowing 255 for int8_t, similar for int16_t
and int32_t, and even negative values for unsignd types.

this patch fixes bounds checking for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit types.
testing for both acceptable values and unacceptable values at the
boundaries are also improved.

bounds checking on 64-bit types isn't addressed by this patch.

Allow tables to be mapped to native types directly.  For example, a table
representing a vector3 (eg. table Vec3 { x:float; y:float; z:float; }) can
be mapped to a ""mathfu::vec3"" native type in NativeTables.  This requires
users to provide Pack and UnPack functions that convert between the
Table and native types.  This is done by adding the ""native_type"" attribute
to the table definition.

To support user-defined flatbuffers::Pack and flatbuffers::UnPack functions,
support a ""native_include"" markup that will generate a corresponding

Also add an UnPackTo function which allows users to pass in a pointer to
a NativeTable object into which to UnPack the Table.  The existing UnPack
function is now simply:

  NativeTable* UnPack() {
    NativeTable* obj = new NativeTable();
    Table::UnPackTo(obj);
    return obj;
  }

Finally, allow native types to be given a default value as well which are
set in the NativeTable constructor.  This is done by providing a
""native_default"" attribute to the member of a table.

Helps simplify code generation code.  Instead of this:
  code += ""inline const "" + cpp_qualified_name + "" *Get"";
  code += name;
  code += ""(const void *buf) {\n  return flatbuffers::GetRoot<"";
  code += cpp_qualified_name + "">(buf);\n}\n\n"";

You do this:
  code.SetValue(""NAME"", struct_def.name);
  code.SetValue(""CPP_NAME"", cpp_qualified_name);
  code += ""inline const {{CPP_NAME}} *Get{{NAME}}(const void *buf) {"";
  code += ""  return flatbuffers::GetRoot<{{CPP_NAME}}>(buf);"";
  code += ""}"";
  code += """";

Updated the CPP code generator to use the CodeWriter class.  Most of the
changes in the generated code are white-space changes, esp. around new
lines (since the code generator class automatically appends new lines
when appending a string).  Actual code changes include:

* Renamed ""rehasher"" to ""_rehasher"" for consistency with other args in
  Pack function.

* Renamed ""union_obj"" to ""obj: in UnPack function.

* Always do ""(void)_o;"" to prevent unused variable warning in Create
  function (instead of only doing it if there are no fields) in order
  to avoid two-passes.

* Renamed padding variables from __paddingX to paddingX__.
  ""Each name that contains a double underscore (_ _) [...] is reserved
   to the implementation for any use.""  C++ standards 17.4.3.1.2.

* Add braces around switch cases.

* Calculate index as a separate statement in EnumName function, eg.
    const size_t index = ...;
    return EnumNamesX()[index];
  vs.
    return EnumNamesX()[...];

* Stored end table offset in variable in Finish() functions, eg.
    const auto end = fbb_.EndTable(start_, ...);
    auto o = flatbuffers::Offset<T>(end);
  vs.
    auto o = flatbuffers::Offset<T>(fbb_.EndTable(start, ...));

* Separate reinterpret_cast calls from function calls in Union
  functions, eg.
    auto ptr = reinterpret_cast<const T *>(obj);
    return ptr->UnPack(resolver);
  vs.
    return reinterpret_cast<const T *>(obj)->UnPack(resolver);

* Removed unecessary (void)(padding__X) no-ops from constructors, eg.
    Test(int16_t a, int8_t b) : ... {
      (void)__padding0;  // <-- Removed this line.
    }

making the allocation the responsibility of the client and the destruction
the responsibility of the Union can lead to potential errors.  Adding a

Make it OSGi compliant. Generate the flatbuffers code for testing (example).

Java developer are mostly comfortable with maven project structure. One one the main concept behind maven is convention. If you follow the maven project convention then your development team will get more effective as they now this project structure and can easily find the production code versus the test code.
 In this pull request I have structured the java project around 2 main parts:
  * the `flatbuffers` project. This project is the api / lib project and contains the test code structure + an example of code generation for testing. This avoid to commit generated code. Pre-configure JUnit for test driven development and make this project OSGi compliant.
  * the `jmh` project. This project aims to provide a placeholder for micro-benchmarking. JMH is a 'de facto' standard for micro benchmarking you can find more details here: http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/

For now I didn't move the JavaTest class but it could be a next step with a migration to the JUnit framework.
The only impacts are the move of the class and the project structure => no code change."

This avoids the following allocations over repeated use:

- A ``CharsetEncoder``
- A byte array to contain the contents of the string
- A wrapper, via ``ByteBuffer#wrap``, for the previously mentioned byte
  array

This also removes a copy of the temporary byte array.  This extra copy
is needed because ``String#getBytes`` returns a byte array and its
length must match the exact size of the contents.

This implementation requires that the builder retain a ``ByteBuffer``
and ``CharEncoder``.  This is considered slower only for users that
will only allocate a single string in their buffers or none at all.

The improvement is especially potent if the builder is constantly reused
by its caller.  This also eliminates the penalty for users that do not
use strings at all since the cost of allocating these fields is
now amortized.

The only allocation left in this code is a ``CharBuffer`` wrapper.  It's
possible to eliminate this allocation using an additional copy but need
further profiling to see which is the bigger problem."

Removes the following allocations:
- ``CharsetDecoder`` is reused between calls
- ``CharBuffer#wrap`` removed in favor of heap
  based char buffer that is reused
- Temporary ``char[]``, an intermediate copy inside ``StringCoding``
- Another ``char[]``, this is needed because ``StringCoding`` uses
  a ``CharBuffer`` internally but returns a ``char[]``.  Extra
  characters need to be trimmed so this means yet another allocation
- Yet another ``char[]`` directly from ``__string`` for non-heap
  based buffers

Removes the following copies
- No copy is performed to trim the allocation since a ``CharBuffer``
  is used directly
- For non-heap based byte buffers, removes the copy that was
  previously done in the __string function

This does need to get the TLS entry which implies at least some
contention on the thread object table and a fence."

CreateUninitializedVector was performing the following actions:
    1. call StartVector.
    2. call make_space, and set buf to point to the reserved space.
    3. call EndVector.

The problem is that a call to EndVector can ultimately call make_space, which
if the buffer is full, will cause a reallocation, invalidating the value stored
in buf.  So setting buf needs to be delayed until after EndVector.

The following code, when run under valgrind shows a write to free'd memory before
the change, but no such error after:

int main()
{
    flatbuffers::FlatBufferBuilder fbb(128);
    char *buf = nullptr;
    fbb.CreateUninitializedVector(128, &buf);

necessary which is not efficient. Helper __vector_as_bytes has been
implemented in order to return the byte arrays in PHP efficiently.

Appropriate methods also been added to use aforementioned method to return
the byte array. (e.g. get*Bytes()).

The reason the methods are named get*Bytes() and not for instance
get*ByteArray() is the fact that PHP doesn't support byte arrays and the
binary safe string implementation in PHP is used to simulate byte arrays
and since there is chance for PHP users to confuse this with PHP arrays
the name get*Bytes() has been chosen.

In the future __vector_as_bytebuffer() method can also be implemented to
return PHP implementation of ByteBuffer."

There was no way to pass an already-encoded string to 
`builder.CreateString` in Python 2.7:

- Passing a `bytearray` raised a TypeError because `bytearray` was not
  recognized as an instance of `compat.binary_type`.
- Passing a utf-8 encoded `str` would cause the string to be
  double-encoded, because `compat.string_types = (basestring,)` and
  `basestring` is the base class of `str` and `unicode`, so the logic
  would never reach the `elif isinstance(s, compat.binary_type)` case.
- Converting a utf-8 encoded bytearray to `bytes` like
  `builder.CreateString(bytes(encoded_string))` does not work because
  in Python 2.7, bytes is just an alias for `str` so it behaves as
  above.

This change allows either `bytes` or `bytearray` as an already-encoded
string to be passed to `CreateString` in versions of Python that support
`bytearray`, and falls back to `str` in older versions.

In Python 2, it restricts unencoded string types to `unicode`, so `str`
can be used as an encoded, binary representaiton."

I updated idl_gen_general.cpp to add support for generating a Get Bytes
method for a vector to the generated C# source code. Given a byte vector
field named Foo, a method named GetFooBytes() will be generated in the
C# source code that will return an ArraySegment<byte> value referencing
the vector data in the underlying ByteBuffer.

I added a method to Table.cs named __vector_as_arraysegment that is used
by the code generated by the change to the C# generator.
__vector_as_arraysegment will take the offset of the vector and will
return the ArraySegment<byte> value corresponding to the bytes that
store the vector data.

I updated FlatBuffersExampleTests.cs to add tests to validate my
implementation of Table.__vector_as_arraysegment. I added tests to
demonstrate that the bytes for the monster's name can be extracted from
the underlying byte array. I also added tests to show that
Table.__vector_as_arraysegment returns a null value if the vector is not
present in the FlatBuffer.

I used the updated flatc.exe program to regenerate the C# source files
for the MyGame example. The new Monster class includes the GetXXXBytes
methods to return the byte arrays containing data for vectors."

PHP 5.4 higher

Currently, we do not register this library to packagist as still experimental and versioning problem.
If you intended to use flatbuffers with composer. add repostiories section to composer.json like below.

  ""repositories"": [{
    ""type"": ""vcs"",
    ""url"": ""https://github.com/google/flatbuffers""
  }],

 and just put google/flatbuffers.

  ""require"": {
    ""google/flatbuffers"": ""*""
  }

* PHP's integer is platform dependant. we strongly recommend use 64bit machine
  and don't use uint, ulong types as prevent overflow issue.
  ref: http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php

* php don't support float type. floating point numbers are always parsed as double precision internally.
  ref: http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.float.php

* ByteBuffer is little bit slow implemnentation due to many chr/ord function calls. Especially encoding objects.
  This is expected performance as PHP5 has parsing arguments overhead. probably we'll add C-extension.

Basically, PHP implementation respects Java and C# implementation.

Note: ByteBuffer and FlatBuffersBuilder class are not intended to use other purposes.
      we may change internal API foreseeable future.

PSR-2, PSR-4 standards.

Implemented simple assertion class (respect JavaScript testcase implementation) as we prefer small code base.
this also keeps CI iteration speed.

we'll choose phpunit or something when the test cases grown."

Before this change, requesting a large initial allocation could cause the
backing store to grow to an unaligned size. Since memory inside vector_downward
is relative to the end of the buffer, this then caused all memory in the buffer
to be misaligned and also misaligns any further loads and stores. Misaligned
loads and stores are undefined behavior and don't work in environments such as
emscripten (a JavaScript to C++ compiler)."

Implement code generation and self-contained runtime library for Python.

The test suite verifies:
  - Correctness of generated Python code by comparing output to that of

  - The exact bytes in the Builder buffer during many scenarios.
  - Vtable deduplication correctness.
  - Edge cases for table construction, via a fuzzer derived from the Go
    implementation.
  - All code is simultaneously valid in Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.4.

The test suite includes benchmarks for:
  - Building 'gold' data.
  - Parsing 'gold' data.
  - Deduplicating vtables.

All tests pass on this author's system for the following Python
implementations:
  - CPython 2.6.7
  - CPython 2.7.8
  - CPython 3.4.2
  - PyPy 2.5.0 (CPython 2.7.8 compatible)"

of nonparametric accessor methods, for more idiomatic C# style.

This is a breaking change, all client C# code accessing these
fields needs to be changed (i.e. remove those `()` or add the
`Get` prefix).

The satellite data of the ``ByteBuffer`` cannot be modified in
any way and stay thread safe in the presence of concurrent readers.

This implementation is simple and does introduce an allocation, however
without it multiple readers will quickly and continuously encounter
``IndexOutOfBoundsException`` exceptions.

An alternative, but possibly more controversial, implementation would
be to use ``Unsafe``.  Using ``Unsafe``, it's possible to do an
array copy with a provided buffer index.
