Add LDAP based users-groups system

This change adds support to integrate an LDAP server for user
authentication. This works via a custom STS API for LDAP. Each user
accessing the MinIO who can be authenticated via LDAP receives
temporary credentials to access the MinIO server.

LDAP is enabled only over TLS.

User groups are also supported via LDAP. The administrator may
configure an LDAP search query to find the group attribute of a user -
this may correspond to any attribute in the LDAP tree (that the user
has access to view). One or more groups may be returned by such a
query.

A group is mapped to an IAM policy in the usual way, and the server
enforces a policy corresponding to all the groups and the user's own
mapped policy.

When LDAP is configured, the internal MinIO users system is disabled."

This commit adds a new method `UpdateKey` to the KMS
interface.

The purpose of `UpdateKey` is to re-wrap an encrypted
data key (the key generated & encrypted with a master key by e.g.
Vault).
For example, consider Vault with a master key ID: `master-key-1`
and an encrypted data key `E(dk)` for a particular object. The
data key `dk` has been generated randomly when the object was created.
Now, the KMS operator may ""rotate"" the master key `master-key-1`.
However, the KMS cannot forget the ""old"" value of that master key
since there is still an object that requires `dk`, and therefore,
the `D(E(dk))`.
With the `UpdateKey` method call MinIO can ask the KMS to decrypt
`E(dk)` with the old key (internally) and re-encrypted `dk` with
the new master key value: `E'(dk)`.

However, this operation only works for the same master key ID.
When rotating the data key (replacing it with a new one) then
we perform a `UnsealKey` operation with the 1st master key ID
and then a `GenerateKey` operation with the 2nd master key ID.

This commit also updates the KMS documentation and removes
the `encrypt` policy entry (we don't use `encrypt`) and
add a policy entry for `rewarp`."

There is no reliable way to handle fallbacks for

Parsing command line options is tricky to figure
out which is the backend disk etc, we did try
to fix this in implementations of check-user.go
but it wasn't complete and introduced more bugs.

This PR simplifies the entire approach to rather
than running Docker container as non-root by default
always, it allows users to opt-in. Such that they
are aware that that is what they are planning to do.

In-fact there are other ways docker containers can
be run as regular users, without modifying our
internal behavior and adding more complexities."

The SQL parser as it stands right now ignores alias for aggregate
result, e.g. `SELECT COUNT(*) AS thing FROM s3object` doesn't actually
return record like `{""thing"": 42}`, it returns a record like `{""_1"": 42}`.
Column alias for aggregate result is supported in AWS's S3 Select, so
this commit fixes that by respecting the `expr.As` in the expression.

Also improve test for S3 select

On top of testing a simple `SELECT` query, we want to test a few more
""advanced"" queries (e.g. aggregation).

Convert existing tests into table driven tests[1], and add the new test
cases with ""advanced"" queries into them.

own root credentials and as well as separate
regions. This way buckets get further restrictions

across clusters/data centers.

Existing data in etcd gets migrated to backend
on each clusters, upon start. Once done
users can change their config entries
independently."

The problem in current code was we were removing
an entry from a lock lockerMap without considering
the fact that different entry for same resource is
a possibility due the nature of locks that can be
acquired in parallel before we decide if the lock
is considered stale

A sequence of events is as follows

 - Lock(""resource"")
 - lockMaintenance(finds a long lived lock in this ""resource"")
 - Owner node rebooted which now retruns Expired() as true for
   this ""resource""
 - Unlock(""resource"") which succeeded in quorum
 - Now by this time application retried and acquired a new
   Lock() on the same ""resource""
 - Now that we have Expired() true from the previous call,
   we proceed to purge the entry from the local lockMap()
   local lockMap reports a different entry for the expired
   UID which results in a spurious log entry.

This PR removes this logging as this situation is an
expected scenario."

This commit fixes another privilege escalation issue
abusing the inter-node communication of distributed
servers to obtain/modify the server configuration.

The inter-node communication is authenticated using
JWT-Tokens. Further, IAM users accessing the cluster
via the web UI also get a JWT token and the browser
will add this ""user"" JWT token to each the request.

Now, a user can extract that JWT token an can craft
HTTP POST requests for the inter-node communication
API endpoint. Since the server accepts ANY valid
JWT token it also accepts inter-node commands from
an authenticated user such that the user can execute
arbitrary commands bypassing the IAM policy engine
and impersonate other users, change its own IAM policy
or extract the admin access/secret key.

This is fixed by only accepting ""admin"" JWT tokens
(tokens containing the admin access key - and therefore
were generated with the admin secret key). Consequently,
only the admin user can execute such inter-node commands."

This commit fixes a nil pointer dereference issue
that can occur when the Vault KMS returns e.g. a 404
with an empty HTTP response. The Vault client SDK
does not treat that as error and returns nil for
the error and the secret.

Further it simplifies the token renewal and
re-authentication mechanism by using a single
background go-routine.

The control-flow of Vault authentications looks
like this:
1. `authenticate()`: Initial login and start of background job
2. Background job starts a `vault.Renewer` to renew the token
3. a) If this succeeds the token gets updated
   b) If this fails the background job tries to login again
4. If the login in 3b. succeeded goto 2. If it fails
   goto 3b."

Before this change the CopyObjectHandler and the CopyObjectPartHandler
both looked for a `versionId` parameter on the `X-Amz-Copy-Source` URL
for the version of the object to be copied on the URL unescaped version
of the header.  This meant that files that had question marks in were
truncated after the question mark so that files with `?` in their
names could not be server side copied.

After this change the URL unescaping is done during the parsing of the
`versionId` parameter which fixes the problem.

This change also introduces the same logic for the
`X-Amz-Copy-Source-Version-Id` header field which was previously
ignored, namely returning an error if it is present and not `null`
since minio does not currently support versions.

This commit moves the check that SSE-C requests

Since the HTTP server uses custom TCP connection handling
it is not possible to use `http.Request.TLS` to check
for TLS connections. So using `globalIsSSL` is the only
option to detect whether the request is made over TLS.
By extracting this check into a separate handler it's possible
to refactor other parts of the SSE handling code further."

etag (a.k.a. content MD5) in case of SSE single-part upload.

Sealing the ETag is neccessary in case of SSE-S3 to preserve
the security guarantees. In case of SSE-S3 AWS returns the
content-MD5 of the plaintext object as ETag. However, we
must not store the MD5 of the plaintext for encrypted objects.
Otherwise it becomes possible for an attacker to detect
equal/non-equal encrypted objects. Therefore we encrypt
the ETag before storing on the backend. But we only need
to encrypt the ETag (content-MD5) if the client send it -
otherwise the client cannot verify it anyway."

Currently, one node in a cluster can fail to boot with the following error message:

```
ERROR Unable to initialize config system: Storage resources are insufficient for the write operation
```

  This happens when disks are formatted, read quorum is met but write
quorum is not met. In checkServerConfig(), a insufficient read quorum
error is replaced by errConfigNotFound, the code will generate a
new config json and try to save it, but it will fail because write
quorum is not met.

  Replacing read quorum with errConfigNotFound is also wrong because it
can lead, in rare cases, to overwrite the config set by the user.

  So, this commit adds a retry mechanism in configuration initialization
to retry only with read or write quorum errors.

  This commit will also fix the following cases:
 - Read quorum is lost just after the initialization of the object layer.
 - Write quorum not met when upgrading configuration version."

we rely on to extract the incoming file data, strangely when `filename`

top-level callers such as ListObjects might return early

This commit tries to address this in Kubernetes, drbd/nbd based

Healthcheck handler in current implementation was
performing ListBuckets() to check for liveness of Minio
service. ListBuckets() implementation on the other hand
doesn't do quorum based listing and if one of the disks
returned error, an I/O error it would be lead to kubernetes
taking the minio pod down prematurely even if the disk
is not local to that minio server.

The reason is ListBuckets() call cannot be trusted to
provide us the valid information that we need, Minio is a
clustered application which is designed to handle disk
failures. Error on one of the disks doesn't mean the pod
should become fully non-operational.

This PR attempts to fix this by only checking for alive
disks which are local to each setup and also by simply
performing a Stat() operation, if the Stat() returned
error on all disks local to a particular server then
we can let kubernetes safely take it down, until then
we should be operational."

This commit fixes a weakness of the key-encryption-key
derivation for SSE-C encrypted objects. Before this
change the key-encryption-key was not bound to / didn't
depend on the object path. This allows an attacker to
repalce objects - encrypted with the same
client-key - with each other.

This change fixes this issue by updating the
key-encryption-key derivation to include:
 - the domain (in this case SSE-C)
 - a canonical object path representation
 - the encryption & key derivation algorithm

Changing the object path now causes the KDF to derive a
different key-encryption-key such that the object-key
unsealing fails.
Including the domain (SSE-C) and encryption & key
derivation algorithm is not directly neccessary for this
fix. However, both will be included for the SSE-S3 KDF.
So they are included here to avoid updating the KDF
again when we add SSE-S3.

The leagcy KDF 'DARE-SHA256' is only used for existing
objects and never for new objects / key rotation."

This commit limits the amount of memory allocated by the
S3 Multi-Object-Delete-API. The server used to allocate as
many bytes as provided by the client using Content-Length.

S3 specifies that the S3 Multi-Object-Delete-API can delete
at most 1000 objects using a single request.
(See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/multiobjectdeleteapi.html)
Since the maximum S3 object name is limited to 1024 bytes the
XML body sent by the client can only contain up to 1000 * 1024
bytes (excluding XML format overhead).

This commit limits the size of the parsed XML for the S3
Multi-Object-Delete-API to 2 MB. This fixes a DoS
vulnerability since (auth.) clients, MitM-adversaries
(without TLS) and un-auth. users accessing buckets allowing
multi-delete by policy can kill the server.

This behavior is similar to the AWS-S3 implementation."

This commit fixes a DoS vulnerability for certain APIs using
signature V4 by verifying the content-md5 and/or content-sha56 of
the request body in a streaming mode.

The issue was caused by reading the entire body of the request into
memory to verify the content-md5 or content-sha56 checksum if present.

The vulnerability could be exploited by either replaying a V4 request
(in the 15 min time frame) or sending a V4 presigned request with a
large body."

Further this change also rejects ECDSA private keys of P-384 and P-521.
While non-constant-time implementations for the ECDHE exchange don't expose an
obvious vulnerability, using P-384 or P-521 keys for the ECDSA signature may allow
pratical timing attacks.

into setup and perform a heal - at this point creating

This PR adds disk based edge caching support for minio server.

Cache settings can be configured in config.json to take list of disk drives,
cache expiry in days and file patterns to exclude from cache or via environment
variables MINIO_CACHE_DRIVES, MINIO_CACHE_EXCLUDE and MINIO_CACHE_EXPIRY

Design assumes that Atime support is enabled and the list of cache drives is
fixed.
 - Objects are cached on both GET and PUT/POST operations.
 - Expiry is used as hint to evict older entries from cache, or if 80% of cache
   capacity is filled.
 - When object storage backend is down, GET, LIST and HEAD operations fetch
   object seamlessly from cache.

Current Limitations
 - Bucket policies are not cached, so anonymous operations are not supported in
   offline mode.
 - Objects are distributed using deterministic hashing among list of cache
   drives specified.If one or more drives go offline, or cache drive
   configuration is altered - performance could degrade to linear lookup.

MaxIdleConns limits the total number of connections
kept in the pool for re-use. In addition, MaxIdleConnsPerHost
limits the number for a single host. Since minio gateways
usually connect to the same host, setting `MaxIdleConns = 100`
won't really have much of an impact since the idle connection
pool is limited to 2 anyway.

Now, with the pool set to a limit of 2, and when using
the client heavily from 2+ goroutines, the `http.Transport`
will open a connection, use it, then try to return it to
the idle-pool which often fails since there's a limit of 2.
So it's going to close the connection and new ones will be
opened on demand again, many of which get closed soon after
being used. Since those connections/sockets don't disappear
from the OS immediately, use `MaxIdleConnsPerHost = 100`
which fixes this problem."

This PR implements an object layer which
combines input erasure sets of XL layers
into a unified namespace.

This object layer extends the existing
erasure coded implementation, it is assumed
in this design that providing > 16 disks is
a static configuration as well i.e if you started
the setup with 32 disks with 4 sets 8 disks per
pack then you would need to provide 4 sets always.

Some design details and restrictions:

- Objects are distributed using consistent ordering
  to a unique erasure coded layer.
- Each pack has its own dsync so locks are synchronized
  properly at pack (erasure layer).
- Each pack still has a maximum of 16 disks
  requirement, you can start with multiple
  such sets statically.
- Static sets set of disks and cannot be
  changed, there is no elastic expansion allowed.
- Static sets set of disks and cannot be
  changed, there is no elastic removal allowed.
- ListObjects() across sets can be noticeably
  slower since List happens on all servers,
  and is merged at this sets layer.

- Changes related to moving admin APIs
   - admin APIs now have an endpoint under /minio/admin
   - admin APIs are now versioned - a new API to server the version is
     added at ""GET /minio/admin/version"" and all API operations have the
     path prefix /minio/admin/v1/<operation>
   - new service stop API added
   - credentials change API is moved to /minio/admin/v1/config/credential
   - credentials change API and configuration get/set API now require TLS
     so that credentials are protected
   - all API requests now receive JSON
   - heal APIs are disabled as they will be changed substantially

- Heal API changes
   Heal API is now provided at a single endpoint with the ability for a
   client to start a heal sequence on all the data in the server, a
   single bucket, or under a prefix within a bucket.

   When a heal sequence is started, the server returns a unique token
   that needs to be used for subsequent 'status' requests to fetch heal
   results.

   On each status request from the client, the server returns heal result
   records that it has accumulated since the previous status request. The
   server accumulates upto 1000 records and pauses healing further
   objects until the client requests for status. If the client does not
   request any further records for a long time, the server aborts the
   heal sequence automatically.

   A heal result record is returned for each entity healed on the server,
   such as system metadata, object metadata, buckets and objects, and has
   information about the before and after states on each disk.

   A client may request to force restart a heal sequence - this causes
   the running heal sequence to be aborted at the next safe spot and
   starts a new heal sequence."

Under any concurrent removeObjects in progress
might have removed the parents of the same prefix
for which there is an ongoing putObject request.
An inconsistent situation may arise as explained
below even under sufficient locking.

PutObject is almost successful at the last stage when
a temporary file is renamed to its actual namespace
at `a/b/c/object1`. Concurrently a RemoveObject is
also in progress at the same prefix for an `a/b/c/object2`.

To create the object1 at location `a/b/c` PutObject has
to create all the parents recursively.

```
a/b/c - os.MkdirAll loops through has now created
        'a/' and 'b/' about to create 'c/'
a/b/c/object2 - at this point 'c/' and 'object2'
        are deleted about to delete b/
```

Now for os.MkdirAll loop the expected situation is
that top level parent 'a/b/' exists which it created
, such that it can create 'c/' - since removeObject
and putObject do not compete for lock due to holding
locks at different resources. removeObject proceeds
to delete parent 'b/' since 'c/' is not yet present,
once deleted 'os.MkdirAll' would receive an error as
syscall.ENOENT which would fail the putObject request.

This PR tries to address this issue by implementing
a safer/guarded approach where we would retry an operation
such as `os.MkdirAll` and `os.Rename` if both operations
observe syscall.ENOENT.

because of the the bitwise '|' would lead to always
higher affinity to odd sequences.

As can be seen from the test cases that this can
lead to many objects being allocated the same set
of disks or atleast the first disk is an odd disk
always.  This introduces a performance problem
for majority of the objects under concurrent load.

Remove `| 1` to provide a more cleaner distribution

The Sia gateway had a bug with uploading that prevented the user's uploads
from reaching the Sia backend. The PutObject function called fsRemoveFile at
the end of the function, which didn't give the Sia backend enough time to
upload the file to the Sia network.

This adds a goroutine that watches the file upload progress and doesn't delete
the file until the upload reaches 100% complete.

Note that this solution has the limitation where if the minio process dies in
the middle of upload, it will leave orphaned files in the SIA_TEMP directory
that the user will need to remove manually."

This chnage replaces the current SSE-C key derivation scheme. The 'old'
scheme derives an unique object encryption key from the client provided key.
This key derivation was not invertible. That means that a client cannot change
its key without changing the object encryption key.
AWS S3 allows users to update there SSE-C keys by executing a SSE-C COPY with
source == destination. AWS probably updates just the metadata (which is a very
cheap operation). The old key derivation scheme would require a complete copy
of the object because the minio server would not be able to derive the same
object encryption key from a different client provided key (without breaking
the crypto. hash function).

This change adds server-side-encryption support for HEAD, GET and PUT
operations. This PR only addresses single-part PUTs and GETs without
HTTP ranges.

Further this change adds the concept of reserved object metadata which is required
to make encrypted objects tamper-proof and provide API compatibility to AWS S3.
This PR adds the following reserved metadata entries:
- X-Minio-Internal-Server-Side-Encryption-Iv          ('guarantees' tamper-proof property)
- X-Minio-Internal-Server-Side-Encryption-Kdf         (makes Key-MAC computation negotiable in future)
- X-Minio-Internal-Server-Side-Encryption-Key-Mac     (provides AWS S3 API compatibility)

The prefix `X-Minio_Internal` specifies an internal metadata entry which must not
send to clients. All client requests containing a metadata key starting with `X-Minio-Internal`
must also rejected. This is implemented by a generic-handler.

This PR implements SSE-C separated from client-side-encryption (CSE). This cannot decrypt
server-side-encrypted objects on the client-side. However, clients can encrypted the same object
with CSE and SSE-C.

This PR does not address:
 - SSE-C Copy and Copy part
 - SSE-C GET with HTTP ranges
 - SSE-C multipart PUT
 - SSE-C Gateway

Each point must be addressed in a separate PR.

percentage of the filesystem blocks which may only be allocated by admnistrative
privileged processes.

The calculations for the `Total` disk space need to subtract the difference
between the `Bfree` and `Bavail` fields for it to correctly show the total
available storage space available for unprivileged users.

This implicitly fixes a bug where the `Used = Total - Free` calculation yielded
different (and also incorrect) results for identical contents stored when only
the sizes of the disks or backing volumes differed. (as can be witnessed in the
`Used:` value displayed in the Minio browser)

The default timeout of 30secs is not enough for high latency
environments, change these values to use 15 minutes instead.

With 30secs I/O timeouts seem to be quite common, this leads
to pretty much most SDKs and clients reconnect. This in-turn
causes significant performance problems. On a low latency
interconnect this can be quite challenging to transfer large
amounts of data. Setting this value to 15minutes covers
pretty much all known cases.

This PR was tested with `wondershaper <NIC> 20000 20000` by
limiting the network bandwidth to 20Mbit/sec. Default timeout
caused a significant amount of I/O timeouts, leading to
constant retires from the client. This seems to be more common
with tools like rclone, restic which have high concurrency set
by default. Once the value was fixed to 15minutes i/o timeouts
stopped and client could steadily upload data to the server
even while saturating the network.

Wait for remote hosts to resolve instead of failing on first host
resolution error, when running in Kubernetes or Docker environment.

Note that

- Waiting is based on exponential back-off mechanism
- If run as a binary, server fails if remote host is not resolvable

This is needed because in orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, remote
hosts are started sequentially and all the hosts are not up initially,
though they are expected to come up in a short time frame
It is difficult to identify a cap on the waiting time due to
non-deterministic nature of infrastructure platforms, so the server waits
infinitely for the hosts to come up, while logging the error messages to
the console.

This commit changes posix's deleteFile() to not upstream errors from
removing parent directories. This fixes a race condition.

The race condition occurs when multiple deleteFile()s are called on the
same parent directory, but different child files. Because deleteFile()
recursively removes parent directories if they are empty, but
deleteFile() errors if the selected deletePath does not exist, there was
an opportunity for a race condition. The two processes would remove the
child directories successfully, then depend on the parent directory
still existing. In some cases this is an invalid assumption, because
other processes can remove the parent directory beforehand. This commit
changes deleteFile() to not upstream an error if one occurs, because the
only required error should be from the immediate deletePath, not from a
parent path.

In the specific bug report, multiple CompleteMultipartUpload requests
would launch multiple deleteFile() requests. Because they chain up on
parent directories, ultimately at the end, there would be multiple
remove files for the ultimate parent directory,
.minio.sys/multipart/{bucket}. Because only one will succeed and one
will fail, an error would be upstreamed saying that the file does not
exist, and the CompleteMultipartUpload code interpreted this as
NoSuchKey, or that the object/part id doesn't exist. This was faulty
behavior and is now fixed.

The added test fails before this change and passes after this change.

This commit fixes a potential security issue, whereby a full-access
token to the server would be available in the GET URL of a download
request. This fixes that issue by introducing short-expiry tokens, which
are only valid for one minute, and are regenerated for every download
request.

This commit specifically introduces the short-lived tokens, adds tests
for the tokens, adds an RPC call for generating a token given a
full-access token, updates the browser to use the new tokens for
requests where the token is passed as a GET parameter, and adds some
tests with the new temporary tokens.

This commit ditches running verifiers automatically when just building
the server. It retains the verifiers when running tests.

There is very little point to running the verifiers each time a
developer builds the library but has no intent of running the tests.
They're expensive in time; this commit halves the build time on my
system, from 57 seconds to 29 seconds. This is because verifiers updates
the libraries from GitHub each time, which is slightly wasteful.
Additionally, computing cyclomatic complexity is expensive
computationally and isn't necessary to build the library.

Additionally, this allows the library to be built offline. It no longer
requires internet to run make."

This implementation is similar to AMQP notifications:

* Notifications are published on a single topic as a JSON feed
* Topic is configurable, as is the QoS. Uses the paho.mqtt.golang
  library for the mqtt connection, and supports connections over tcp
  and websockets, with optional secure tls support.
* Additionally the minio server configuration has been bumped up
  so mqtt configuration can be added.
* Configuration migration code is added with tests.

MQTT is an ISO standard M2M/IoT messaging protocol and was
originally designed for applications for limited bandwidth
networks. Today it's use is growing in the IoT space."

Looks like if we follow pattern such as

```

Go can potentially kick in GC and close the fd when
the reference is lost, only speculation is that
the cause here is `SetFinalizer` which is set on
`os.close()` internally in `os` stdlib.

This is unexpected and unsual endeavour for Go, but
we have to make sure the reference is never lost
and always dies with the server.

This is an enhancement to the XL/distributed-XL mode. FS mode is
unaffected.

The ReadFileWithVerify storage-layer call is similar to ReadFile with
the additional functionality of performing bit-rot checking. It
accepts additional parameters for a hashing algorithm to use and the
expected hex-encoded hash string.

This patch provides significant performance improvement because:

1. combines the step of reading the file (during
erasure-decoding/reconstruction) with bit-rot verification;

2. limits the number of file-reads; and

3. avoids transferring the file over the network for bit-rot
verification.

ReadFile API is implemented as ReadFileWithVerify with empty hashing
arguments.

Credits to AB and Harsha for the algorithmic improvement.

 - symlinks on docker nanoserver
 - de-duplicated files on NTFS de-duplicated volume.

This removal comes to avoid some redundant requirements
which are adding more problems on a production setup.

Here are the list of checks for time as they happen

 - Fresh connect (during server startup) - CORRECT
 - A reconnect after network disconnect - CORRECT
 - For each RPC call - INCORRECT.

Verifying time for each RPC aggravates a situation
where a RPC call is rejected in a sequence of events
due to enough load on a production setup. 3 second
might not be enough time window for the call to be
initiated and received by the server."

This patch uses a technique where in a retryable storage
before object layer initialization has a higher delay
and waits for longer period upto 4 times with time unit
of seconds.

And uses another set of configuration after the disks
have been formatted, i.e use a lower retry backoff rate
and retrying only once per 5 millisecond.

Network IO error count is reduced to a lower value i.e 256
before we reject the disk completely. This is done so that
combination of retry logic and total error count roughly
come to around 2.5secs which is when we basically take the
disk offline completely.

NOTE: This patch doesn't fix the issue of what if the disk
is completely dead and comes back again after the initialization.
Such a mutating state requires a change in our startup sequence
which will be done subsequently. This is an interim fix to alleviate
users from these issues."

This change brings in changes at multiple places

 - Reuse buffers at almost all locations ranging
   from rpc, fs, xl, checksum etc.
 - Change caching behavior to disable itself
   under low memory conditions i.e < 8GB of RAM.
 - Only objects cached are of size 1/10th the size
   of the cache for example if 4GB is the cache size
   the maximum object size which will be cached
   is going to be 400MB. This change is an
   optimization to cache more objects rather
   than few larger objects.
 - If object cache is enabled default GC
   percent has been reduced to 20% in lieu
   with newly found behavior of GC. If the cache
   utilization reaches 75% of the maximum value
   GC percent is reduced to 10% to make GC
   more aggressive.
 - Do not use *bytes.Buffer* due to its growth
   requirements. For every allocation *bytes.Buffer*
   allocates an additional buffer for its internal
   purposes. This is undesirable for us, so
   implemented a new cappedWriter which is capped to a
   desired size, beyond this all writes rejected.

Possible fix for #3403."

This is needed as explained by @krisis

Lets say we have following errors.

```
[]error{nil, errFileNotFound, errDiskAccessDenied, errDiskAccesDenied}
```

Since the last two errors are filtered, the maximum is nil,
depending on map order.

Let's say we get nil from reduceErr. Clearly at this point
we don't have quorum nodes agreeing about the data and since
GetObject only requires N/2 (Read quorum) and isDiskQuorum
would have returned true. This is problematic and can lead to
undersiable consequences.

In a situation when we have lots of buckets the bootup time
might have slowed down a bit but during this situation the
servers quickly going up and down would be an in-transit state.

Certain calls which do not use quorum like `readXLMetaStat`
might return an error saying `errDiskNotFound` this is returned
in place of expected `errFileNotFound` which leads to an issue
where server doesn't start.

To avoid this situation we need to ignore them as safe values
to be ignored, for the most part these are network related errors.

Ref #3229

After review with @abperiasamy we decided to remove all the unnecessary options

- MINIO_BROWSER (Implemented as a security feature but now deemed obsolete
  since even if blocking access to MINIO_BROWSER, s3 API port is open)
- MINIO_CACHE_EXPIRY (Defaults to 72h)
- MINIO_MAXCONN (No one used this option and we don't test this)
- MINIO_ENABLE_FSMETA (Enable FSMETA all the time)

Remove --ignore-disks option - this option was implemented when XL layer
 would initialize the backend disks and heal them automatically to disallow
 XL accidentally using the root partition itself this option was introduced.

This behavior has been changed XL no longer automatically initializes
`format.json`  a HEAL is controlled activity, so ignore-disks is not
useful anymore. This change also addresses the problems of our documentation
going forward and keeps things simple. This patch brings in reduction of
options and defaulting them to a valid known inputs.  This patch also
serves as a guideline of limiting many ways to do the same thing."

- The remote node interface, makes an RPC call, but the local node
  interface does not - it updates in-memory bucket state directly.

- Rename mkPeersFromEndpoints to makeS3Peers and refactored it.

- Use arrayslice instead of map in s3Peers struct

- `s3Peers.SendUpdate` now receives an arrayslice of peer indexes to
  send the request to, with a special nil value slice indicating that
  all peers should be sent the update.

- `s3Peers.SendUpdate` now returns an arrayslice of errors, representing
  errors from peers when sending an update. The array positions
  correspond to peer array s3Peers.peers

Improve globalS3Peers:

- Make isDistXL a global `globalIsDistXL` and remove from s3Peers

- Make globalS3Peers an array of (address, bucket-meta-state) pairs.

- Fix code and tests."

missing and should be healed through heal operation. But we are
not supposed to fail prematurely since we have enough data on

The reason is any function relying on `getLoadBalancedQuorumDisks`
cannot possibly have an idempotent behavior.

The problem comes from given a set of N disks returning just a
shuffled N/2 disks.  In case of a scenario where we have N/2
number of failed disks, the returned value of `getLoadBalancedQuorumDisks`
is not equal to the same failed disks so essentially calls using such
disks might succeed or fail randomly at different intervals in time.

This proposal change is we move to `getLoadBalancedDisks()`
and use the shuffled N disks as a whole. Since most of the time we might
hit a good disk since we are not reducing our solution space. This
also provides consistent behavior for all the functions which rely
on shuffled disks.

    - Unit tests have to be run in isolation without being have to be associated with other functionalities which are not under test. 
    - The integration tests follows the philosophy of running a Test Server and registers all handlers and fires HTTP requests over the socket to simulate the system functionality under usual work load scenarios and test for correctness. But this philosophy cannot be adopted for running unit tests for HTTP handlers. 
    - Running Unit tests for API handlers, 
        - Shouldn't run a test server. Should purely call the handlers `ServeHTTP` under isolation. 
        - Shouldn't register all handlers, should only register handlers under test and so that the system is close to be in an isolated setup. 

- As an example PutBucketPolicy test is illustrated using the new setup. Exhaustive cases has to be added and has been listen in TODO for now."

- over the course of a project history every maintainer needs to update
  its dependency packages, the problem essentially with godep is manipulating
  GOPATH - this manipulation leads to static objects created at different locations
  which end up conflicting with the overall functionality of golang.

  This also leads to broken builds. There is no easier way out of this other than
  asking developers to do 'godep restore' all the time. Which perhaps as a practice
  doesn't sound like a clean solution. On the other hand 'godep restore' has its own
  set of problems.

- govendor is a right tool but a stop gap tool until we wait for golangs official
  1.5 version which fixes this vendoring issue once and for all.

- govendor provides consistency in terms of how import paths should be handled unlike
  manipulation GOPATH.

  This has advantages
    - no more compiled objects being referenced in GOPATH and build time GOPATH
      manging which leads to conflicts.
    - proper import paths referencing the exact package a project is dependent on.

 govendor is simple and provides the minimal necessary tooling to achieve this.

 For now this is the right solution."
