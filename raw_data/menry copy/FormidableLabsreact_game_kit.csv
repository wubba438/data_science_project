(#59)

Lodash has already rolled out this change in
https://unpkg.com/lodash-es@4.17.5/package.json

## Issues

This was originally uncovered / discussed at length in:

* https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1750

This PR should resolve the issues discussed in:

* https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/issues/549
* https://github.com/FormidableLabs/redux-little-router/issues/262

## Changes

* Add `sideEffects: false` to `package.json` to allow webpack4 tree-shaking to actually remove all unused code.

There are a couple of things going on with #48 --

- We have all this weird `_REACT_HOT_LOADER__` in our `umd` and `lib` builds. I'm guessing that _shouldn't_ be there as we only would want that in `demo` land.
- We get some infinite recursion error with `Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded at Stage.__setDimensions__REACT_HOT_LOADER__` in the actual demo as reported in #48 This looks like an upstream issue with arrow member functions in gaearon/react-hot-loader#698

This PR fixes this and does a little bit of infrastructure housecleaning.

- Fixes #48
- Updates the webpack configs to be a little more modern.
- Lints root JS files in the repository.
- Only babel builds `react-hot-loader` in the _demo_ and not for our produced `lib` or `umd` files.
- Converts all arrow member functions to real member functions to get around the hot loading issues.
    - _Note_: I didn't change the arrow member functions in the `*.example` files.
- Harmonizes `umd` and `build` tasks in `package.json:scripts` to be symmetrical.
- Updates `react-hot-loader` dep and drops `node@4` in Travis due to engines restriction on new RHL."
