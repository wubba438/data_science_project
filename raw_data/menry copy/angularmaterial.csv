- open options pop-up on `touchstart`
  - since a `click` is often not sent on touch devices
  - this usually happens when the start/end point are not the same
- use `touchend` on the document to close the options panel on iOS
  - iOS mostly does not send `click` events for taps on the backdrop
  - call `doBlur()`` since iOS doesn't blur in this case
- combine some jQuery event handler calls
- combine duplicate `onMouseup()` and `focusInputElement()` functions
- don't let touchstart or touchend events bubble out of the component
- focus the input for `mousedown` events
  - this covers an edge case on touch pads where a `click` isn't sent
- move `isIos` and `isAndroid` logic out of gestures into `$mdUtil`
- add and correct JSDoc

## What is the current behavior?

If an interimElement fails to compile it will still be added as a ""showingInterimElement""

## What is the new behavior?

## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?

## Other information

Unfortunately the showingInterimElements var is private to the InterimElementFactory and so it is not possible to write unit tests for this without adding additional functionality to the source. If the maintainers decide that is necessary I can definitely do so."

## What is the current behavior?
Consecutive builds, without any changes, result in bundle content with different ordering. This is even true in a single build where the `dist/angular-material.js` isn't identical to the `dist/docs/angular-material.js`. This makes comparing releases harder and it makes syncing into g3 more time consuming.

- passing globs to `gulp.src` can cause ordering to not be preserved.
this is because `gulp.src` is async
- gulp-concat tries to preserve the order passed into `gulp.src`.
if the globbing is too vague, then there isn't enough info for ordering

<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying and link to one or more relevant issues. -->
Issue Number: 
Fixes #11502

## What is the new behavior?
All of the build output (JS, SCSS, CSS) should be identical if the build is run multiple times without any changes to the code. 

## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?
```
[ ] Yes
[x] No
```
<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->
<!-- Note that breaking changes are highly unlikely to get merged to master unless the validation is clear and the use case is critical. -->

## Other information
- more statically defining the paths like this isn't ideal but it is acceptable atm since we aren't adding new components.

I looked at sorting the file paths manually or using `gulp-sort` but neither solution was flexible enough to order some of our internal dependencies properly. This approach seems to work fine w/o adding `gulp-order`, but if problems pop up in the future, that is another package that might help.

Note that the root cause of this lies in the intersection of `gulp.src` in Gulp core and `gulp-concat`. This is a well established problem that the Gulp team has mostly decided to punt into user land or third party packages so that they can maintain speed and not need to support crazy levels of customization."

## What is the current behavior?
CircleCI is not enabled to create snapshots, add tags, or update the docs on commits to `master`.
<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying and link to one or more relevant issues. -->
Issue Number: 
Relates to #11592

## What is the new behavior?
After a commit to master, CircleCI runs lint and tests against different AngularJS versions. If those are successful and the commit was to the `master` branch, then it snapshots, commits to `angular/code.material.angularjs.org`, and deploys the updated docs site. It also commits and tags the code snapshot in `angular/bower-material`.

## What is the current behavior?

<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying and link to one or more relevant issues. -->

Currently select labels are mashed into the values of a multi-selector.

This is the result of https://github.com/angular/material/commit/97e2d004523d2ca5ac9b54e567d8eddc7246aae7

Now multi-selectors $render is delayed to fix an incompatibility with forms.

Issue Number: #11571

## What is the new behavior?

Now the label is in the correct place.

To fix this I've updated the method that evaluates whether the select container should add the md-input-has-value class to also happen after $mdUtil.nextTick. This allows the class evaluation to happen in sync with the $render functionality.

After adding a $timeout.flush() to related tests to simulate the nextTick all tests passed.

A test to prove this fix was also added to prevent future regressions.

## What is the current behavior?

<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying and link to one or more relevant issues. -->
Issue Number: #11485 

Currently, the nav-bar element is exposed as a listbox accessible to screen reader users. Its nav-item child consists of a li element which currently has role ""option"" (as appropriate for a listbox child), and the button inside that li is exposed as is.

Screen readers do have a hard time interacting with this construct, since they do not expect an option to contain a button.

## What is the new behavior?

The new behavior is that the nav-bar element is exposed as a tablist, and the button inside the li of the nav-item as a tab accessible. In addition, the aria-label that was originally applied to the nav-item's li element is now applied to the buton, since the li in the tablist/tab pattern is to be marked presentational. aria-label must therefore go onto the element that has role ""tab"".

No changes besides semantic ARIA exposure has been changed, the keyboard behavior is the same as well as any other behavior this component exposes. Web developers needn't change anything, either.

## What is the current behavior?
- A new `npm i` may pick up `jasmine-core@2.99.1` which will cause many test failures since we don't currently support that version.
- Setting `md-nav-href=""""` on an `md-nav-item` doesn't apply the proper `ng-href=""""` because of a bad `if` check.
- The docs indicate that a navigation attribute **must** be defined on each `md-nav-item`, but the code doesn't throw an exception if this occurs. This can lead to unexpected behaviors like infinite loops or hanging async tasks.
- The Closure properties are incorrect in a number of cases.

<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying and link to one or more relevant issues. -->
Issue Number: 
Relates to #11485. Relates to #11486. Fixes #11487.

## What is the new behavior?

- set ng-href on nav-item even if md-nav-href is empty
- fix closure properties to better represent the existing code
- pin the version of jasmine-core since we don't support 2.99.1 yet
- slightly improve the tone of the exceptions
- pull in some karma configuration tweaks from Angular Material

Webkit has a rendering bug with child elements whos parent uses a
rounded corner. In this case, this is a ripple on a rounded button.
To circumvent this issue, we applied a 1x1 PNG image mask on the
ripple element.

The image mask is causing issues with Chrome rendering opaque under
certain conditions. An image mask is only needed for Safari 8, which
is no longer supported. Instead we will just Safari and Chrome to
use a compositing layer by forcing an empty Z-axis translation.

* Inherit border radius from buttons
* Remove image mask CSS
* Use translateZ to force webkit to create a compositing layer

* Adds the ability to restrict users to a calendar view. For example, it's now possible to let users only select a month, instead of having to pick out a date within the month. This can be useful for cases like a credit card form, where the day of the month doesn't necessarily make sense.
* Fixes an issue where the year view wouldn't highlight the proper cell, if the model was changed externally and the date was different from the first day of the month.

1. The `$mdCompiler` is now able to respect the `preAssignBindingsEnabled` state
when using AngularJS 1.5.10 or higher; to enable, invoke:

    $mdCompilerProvider.respectPreAssignBindingsEnabled(true);

2. `$mdCompiler` now understands the `$onInit` lifecycle hooks in controllers.
Note that no other AngularJS 1.5+ lifecycle hooks are supported currently.

Invoking:

    $mdCompilerProvider.respectPreAssignBindingsEnabled(true);

will make bindings in Material custom components like `$mdDialog` or `$mdToast`
only available in controller constructors if they are available in constructors
of all other AngularJS controllers. By default this will happen in AngularJS
1.6 or newer. This can also be achieved with AngularJS >=1.5.10 <1.6.0 if:

    $compilerProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled(false);

is invoked.

Example:

```js
$mdDialog.show({
  locals: {
    myVar: true
  },
  controller: MyController,
  bindToController: true
}

function MyController() {
  // No locals from Angular Material are set yet. e.g myVar is undefined.
}

MyController.prototype.$onInit = function() {
  // Bindings are now set in the $onInit lifecycle hook.
}
```

Huge thanks to Paul Gschwendtner (@DevVersion) for the initial draft version of
this feature.

A few components are using the `bindToController` option for the scope bindings.

Recently a Breaking Change commit landed in the AngularJS master branch, which changed the way the bindings are assigned.

The bindings are no longer pre-assigned in the constructors, and will be only set before the `$onInit` lifecycle hook.

Angular Material supports Angular versions which do not support lifecycle hooks and so we can't ensure that Snapshot and the older versions work together with `$onInit` approach.
---
* Adds the $onInit hook to all affected components and manually dispatches the $onInit hook for AngularJS 1.4 and older versions.

* Fixes two checks in the `datepicker`, which required the controller to have a binding set after $onInit (unnecessary here)"

The datepicker's calendar uses `md-virtual-repeat` to render itself. The virtual repeater expects that all elements that it has rendered will have a certain height, however this may not be the case if it renders an empty month/year element in the calendar. If this happens (it's usually if the current value and the maximum date are in the same month), the calendar can start jumping while scrolling.

This change adds an empty `<tr>` that will ensure that even empty elements have a height. When the element is compiled, the empty `<tr>` will be overwritten.

The current approach for positioning the datepicker's calendar works by expanding the input container in order to fill a gap in the floating calendar pane and using negative margins to prevent the UI from jumping around. This comes with some drawbacks:

* It can shift all of the elements surrounding the datepicker, despite the negative margins.
* It makes it hard to refactor the positioning.

This new approach solves all of the above-mentioned issues by using an element with a box-shadow to create the overlay, avoiding the need for expanding the container.

After some recent changes to the input animations, the input could

actually removing the element from the DOM, so any further message
animations found the old message in the DOM and attempted to show
it.

 - Ensure all input animations properly call the `.done()` method

 - Update tests to check for `.done()` calls and use a better

Fixes the datepicker jumping forward if the current month is also the first one being rendered (e.g. when the min date is in the same month as the model). This was caused by an extra unnecessary call to `generateContent` which made the first month in the calendar to be re-rendered at the bottom after the user has scrolled past it. When the first month is at the bottom, the calendar tries to focus the active date, causing the browser to scroll to the bottom. Afterward the virtual repeater updates the view again, which makes the calendar skip a few months.

Currently when the `selectedItem` changes, we check for the `searchText` being changed as well.

When the `searchText` is empty, we could remove that unnecessary execution and just skip the comparison (Reduces queries)

Also this improves the compatibility with the `virtual repeater`, since the repeater changes the scope bindings during runtime.
e.g `searchText` will be set to `undefined` and a ignorable error will be thrown.

method which disallowed multiple `ng-messages` elements.

* Currently when using `required` on the select, is adding the required validator to the ngModelCtrl.
  The required validator is checking the `$viewValue`by using the `$isEmpty` function, which is overwritten
  by the select component.

  `$isEmpty` normally checks just for truthy values, but our custom `$isEmpty` function checks the value for being a registered option.
  This does not work, because we are just trying to find the value in the options object.
  Once the the value is also an object, we are not able to find the option (which is wrong). All options inside of the variable are stored within their
  associated hashkey.

  That's why we have to retrieve the hashkey of the current value. This is also required for ngModel's with a `trackBy` option.

* Once an option is set to the ngModel, before the actual `md-option` directive is registered, the required validator will be set to `false`.
  We have to trigger a new validation, when the option, which is currently the $modelValue, has been registered.

Fix styles and code to follow pristine/dirty styling of other
input elements and provide CSS class for stand-alone usage.

 - Select now behaves like a normal input, appearing as invalid
   if the user focuses/blurs the element, or submits the form,
   without selecting an option.
 - Fix issues with floating labels not working on focus.
 - Add new `md-no-underline` CSS class to allow for stand-alone
   usage (non-form).
 - Update demos to show new stand-alone usage with required
   example.
 - Standardize asterisk visibility when required when standalone
   or inside of a `<md-input-container>`

Additionally, the select component currently sets the `isOpen`
variable on the `$scope`. This can cause conflicts if the user
has their own `isOpen` variable on the scope.

Fix by privatizing our own variable to `_mdSelectIsOpen` to
reduce chances of a conflict.

By default, Firefox provides focus border styling which was modifying
the layout of the button elements within a menu item. The original
fix was to use `display: flex` to fix this, however, Firefox currently
disregards the `display` property on the buttons and was thus causing
the text to be on a separate line from the text.

Fix by using `display: inline-block` for both `<a>` and `<button>`
elements and adding some special padding for the `<a>` tags to fix
the top alignment. Also apply special Firefox-specific styling to
remove the focus border/styling.

Initially, the tabs used DOMSubtreeModified to listen for changes
and update the height, pagination and inkbar styles. At some point,
we used a different method to update the height, but we were still
watching all DOM changes and updating the pagination and inkbar
styles whenever the contents changed.

Fix this with the following two changes:

1. Move the DOM watching to a new md-tabs-dummy-wrapper directive
   which only watches for changes to the tab's labels (not the
   content too) so that the updates are called less frequently.

2. Replace DOMSubtreeModified watching with new MutationObservers
   which are more drastically more performant.

Additionally, some recent changes caused some bugs in the tabs by
using a cached version of the internal elements instead of calling
`getElements()` which searches the DOM and refreshes the cached
elements.

Fix by adding more calls to `getElements()` where appropriate to
properly update the cache after tabs may have changed.

rebase if this goes in first.

1) The first `nextTick` call didn't supply a scope, but subsequent calls did.
2) Multiple components (with different scopes) registered callbacks during the same digest cycle.

This could lead to callbacks being executed when they shouldn't be (if

* Other components, like `md-toolbar` use a custom transition on the background-color, color etc, but the related CSS selector has a high specificity.

* So for example, when ng-hide is applied, then we set the transition to `none`.
But that's not working sometimes, because the both selectors have the same specificity.

To fix this, we can apply `!important` or increase the selector specificity by using a CSS hack.

https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#specificity

The toolbar selector has in our case a specificity of 20.
* .md-button.ng-hide // 0,0,2,0
* .md-toolbar-tools .md-button // 0,0,2,0

------
So this is actually a thing, which is caused by $ngAnimate, which is not
able to solve this issue.

We need to reset the transition duration, when $ngAnimate looks for it,
manually.

The current API supports `$mdSideNav().find(id)`, `$mdSideNav().waitFor(id)`, `$mdSideNav(id)` usages.

This fix will allow code like this:

```js
// If the component has already been instantiated
$scope.isOpenRight = function(){
      return $mdSidenav('right').isOpen();
};

var right;

// If the component will be created later
$scope.isOpenRight = function(){

Many components use classes that should be noted as private/internal
classes. Update components accordingly by prefixing classes with
`_md-`.

 * Subheader
 * Chips
 * Content

Refactor the `md-visually-hidden` class to `_md-visually-hidden`

Also make a slight change to icon docs for better readability.

appropriate docs.

BREAKING CHANGE

The `autoScroll` class of the `<md-content>` directive has been
renamed to `md-no-momentum` to increase clarity and mark it as
an API-level class.

it to the new name `md-no-momentum`.

The current description for the autocomplete attribute was really confusing, and the user was wondering why the autocomplete wasn't retrieving focus automatically.
But they didn't know about the other behaviour of the actual `md-autofocus` directive.
The autocomplete attribute ""wrap"" is just a little addition which focus the related input instead of the element.

The `line-height` property of the FAB buttons was removed to fix
an issue with the tooltip demo. This had unintended consequences
on FABs that used `ui-sref` which made them `<a>` tags instead of
`<button>` tags.

The tooltip demo issue was caused by the parent `<md-content>`
applying it's padding to all of it's children.

Revert the line-height change and fix demos by wrapping child
content in a new `<div>` which accepts the extra padding.

Previously when a model was set with a value outside of the `min` or
the `max` of the slider, it would call `setSliderPercent` with the
initial value and no check would occur to make sure that the value of
the model could not extend the range of the slider.

The below screenshot demonstrates what the slider looks like when it has
been initialised with a value of `-1`.

![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/BxBpz2J.png)

As you can see, the thumb is floating way off to the left. This is due
to the `left: -25%` style that has been applied to the element. It is
worth noting that the `min` and `max` are `0` and `4` respectively.

This was due to an old bug where closing a dialog from a hidden action
item was throwing an issue. This has since been fixed so we can revert
this back to the original code that used `scale(0)` instead of
`scale(0.1)` which ensured that the dialog always had a button to animate
to when closing.

When the ngMessages directive was used with the ngShow,
ngIf and other directives inside of an md-input-container,
the messages would flicker and jump rather than properly
animating.

Additionally, if the messages spanned multiple lines,
the animations were incorrect due to hard-coded values.

Fix many styles and move animations into JS so we can
properly calculate message heights.

Also, add more flexibility with the `md-auto-hide` CSS
class and associated attribute and update docs/demo
accordingly.

BREAKING CHANGE

By default, the `<md-input-container>` now automatically
hides any error messages until the component is in an
error state (determined by `md-is-error`). If you wish
to achieve the original behavior where messages are
always visible, add the `md-auto-hide=""false""` attribute
to your `ng-messages` or use one of the following
visibility directives:

 - `ng-if`
 - `ng-show`/`ng-hide`
 - `ng-switch-when`/`ng-switch-default`

When the md-tab-label CSS width is calculated to a fraction numbem, its
value and element.offsetWidth don't match. When the paging container's
width is calculated, depending on how the offsetWidth of each label is
truncated/rounded, the resulting width is smaller then the actual sum of
all labels, and that breaks the line and forces the last label to go to
next line, and its offsetLeft to be zero. That behaviour disables the next
page button, causing the pagination to not work. The new width calculation
adds 1px to the offsetWidth to account for rounding/truncating errors,
resulting in a slightly bigger paging container.

The usage of `md-on-append` was not well documented and it's
behavior was inconsistent and confusing; many users assumed
it was a simple notification of chip additions which caused
issues.

*  renamed `md-on-append` to
`md-transform-chip` and provided a new `md-on-add` method
that is strictly a notification.

*  updated the docs and functionality of
`md-transform-chip` to show expected return values and their
associated behavior.

> This new behavior also adds support for simlultaneously using
an autocomplete to select an existing value along with the
ability to create new chips. The most common case for this is
a tag system which shows existing tags, but also allows you to
create new ones.
> Demos have been updated to show new functionality as well as
to workaround a few display issues with the contact chips demo
(#4450).

_**Note:** This work supercedes PR #3816 which can be closed when
this is merged._

BREAKING CHANGE:
`md-on-append` has been renamed/deprecated in favor of
`md-transform-chip` or the simple notifier `md-on-add`.

We expect to remove this completely in 1.0, so please update
your code to use one of the new methods.

For convenience, we automatically wrap templates that do not
contain a `<md-dialog>` tag within them. However, some users
would like the ability to create their own dialog directives
(like `<my-fancy-dialog>`) that internally use the `<md-dialog>`
tag within their template. This causes two `<md-dialog>` tags
to be created.

Provide a new `autoWrap` option which can be set to false to
disable autowrapping when providing a custom directive.

Extend the click-hijacking functionality of `$mdGestures`:

**Background:** iOS emulates click events on a `350ms` delay in order to avoid sending clicks when users pan, perform gestures, etc. This leads to pages often feeling laggy in mobile browsers. This appears to be less of an issue in Safari, but is a major issue in embedded webview applications such as Chrome on iOS and PhoneGap built apps.

To get around this `$mdGesture` currently listens to `touchstart` and `touchend` events to manually dispatch `click` events. This allows it to trigger events much quicker than the 350ms.  It then configures the page to ignore clicks that were not originated by `$mdGesture`.

**Problem:** While `$mdGesture` did successfully hijack the `click`event, it did not hijack other emulated events from iOS, including `mouseup`, `mousedown` and the subsequent `focus` event that could originate from a delayed `click`.

**Example of problem:** Issue #4850 was caused by the `md-select` opening quickly via our simulated `click` event, followed by receiving a `350ms` OS delayed `mousedown` event resulting in an option immediately being selected.

Some other example problems that impact the framework:

- Ink ripples are 350ms delayed (use `mousedown` and `mouseup`)
- Some components / items randomly ripple or trigger
after being focused / click.  Usually this isn't an issue, but can be
(eg. #4850)
- `focus` events are 350ms delayed (Affects input)

This PR makes `$mdGesture` perform hijacking of the `mousedown`, `mouseup` and subsequent `focus` events in order to more quickly dispatch them.

**Notes:** A few of our internal components needed some refactoring as they were properly discarding the emulated `mousedown` (which is now ignored DOM wide) and relying on those events for state, etc.

Ripples will need a fix as they now properly ripple on `mousedown` but can hit a situation where they receive no later `mouseup` event. Perhaps listening to the document-wide `mouseup` event should be registered on `mousedown`. An example is scrolling in the Docs' Sidenav via touch.

When an `md-divider` was used inside of a `md-list-item` with an
`<md-button>`, the divider would improperly show up at the bottom
of the list, instead of the bottom of each list item.

Fix by making the list item's position relative.

Also, we automatically apply special styling when we detect an
`<md-button>` inside of the list item because we assume that it
wraps all of the elements. If you simply wanted to use a secondary
`<md-button>` or other clickable button inside a list, we would
incorrectly apply this styling.

Fix by automatically excluding `md-secondary` buttons and providing
an additional `md-exclude` class that can be added to buttons.

In IE11, the height of the card image was not properly displaying

Fix by setting the image to use flex layout itself instead of just
width.

closes #4846

Themable elements no longer have a `.md-default-theme` class applied to
them if they are not inside of a directive explicitly setting
`md-theme=""default""` this helps reduce specificity making it easier to
override angular material's default style. At the same time, the rule is
applied if `md-theme=""default""` so that the (presumably nested) theme
can have higher specificity than other themes in the DOM.

Fix required: Stylesheets should not target elements using the
`md-default-theme` selector. Overrides should happen by targeting non
angular-material provided classes. As a quick fix, a
`md-theme=""default""` at the `ng-app` level will result in the
`md-default`theme` class being applied as it was before this fix.
Theming related styles now target `md-default-theme` making it harder to
override when the class is applied."

Initially, the speed dial was designed to always open
when the user hovered over any portion of the speed
dial (including the area where the actions would
eventually appear). However, this made the speed dial
unusable on mobile (and sometimes unusable on desktop)
because it disallowed the user from pressing anything
underneath the actions.

*  Add the `md-hover-full` CSS class to allow developer configuration of this behavior.
*  Ensure fabToolbar also works this way, and fix jumpy animation.
*  Also updated the docs/demos and made the demos easier to use on mobile.

BREAKING CHANGE - The fabSpeedDial no longer automatically
opens when hovering over the invisible actions. Add the
`md-hover-full` class to enable this interaction.

Recent updates to the `md-char-counter` class caused alignment
issues when the input was side-by-side with another input. The
underlying cause was that the other input uses `maring-top: auto`
instead of `margin-top: 0` which made the inputs ""bottom aligned""
as the height of it's neighbors changed.

This fixes the CSS on the char counter, inputs and select to
better align and updates the inputs demo to show the select
next to an input with the char counter.

Also, I noticed a bug with the floating labels when using only
the placeholder, so this adds some additional tests and fixes
the bug.

When a `<md-tooltip>` was placed inside the `<md-subheader>`,
an infinite loop was being hit (only in Firefox) which was
causing the browser to hang.

The infinite loop was caused by the tooltip's
`getParentWithPointerEvents()` method which travels up the DOM looking for a parent who has pointer events. In Firefox, the `element.parent()` can apparently return an empty jqLite object that is not null, but whose length is 0. In this case, calling `parent.parent()` again will return the same object.

Add a check to the tooltip's loop to ensure that `parent.length` is never 0.

The recently added support for input elements to have multiple
messages caused a rendering issue for the `md-maxlength`
character counter.

Update code/CSS to properly position the character counter when
used with and without ng-messages.

Fixes #4783.

POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGE - The `<div class=""md-char-counter"">`
that is automatically added to the input is now added after
the input if no messages are found, but inside if they are.

This may cause some styling issues if users provide custom
CSS. Users may need to update their CSS to take the extra
HTML into account.

Example rendered HTML:

**Without `ng-messages`:**

```html
<label>Label is here</label>
<input />
<div class=""md-char-counter"">10/20</div>
```

**With `ng-messages`:**

```html
<label>Label is here</label>
<input />
<div ng-messages=""..."">
  <div class=""md-char-counter"">10/20</div>
  <div ng-message=""requried"">This is required</div>
</div>

Previously, if a user supplied both a placeholder and a label,
the label would float on top of the placeholder when the input
did not have a value.

Fix by adding styles/code to support both at the same time.

**Note:** If the users provides both a label and a placeholder,
the label will no longer animate.

Also fix input styles so transition does not happen if input
already has a value to avoid unneccessary and eratic-looking
animations.

BREAKING CHANGE: The FAB Speed Dial/Toolbar no longer automatically
adds the hover effect. The demo has been updated with example code
which utilizes `ng-mouseenter` and `ng-mouseleave`.

BREAKING CHANGE - Fab Toolbar now requires the use of the `md-direction`
attribute instead of just setting the `md-left` and `md-right` classes.
This is due to the shared controller and keyboard support.

This also provides better support for iOS devices (and presumably
other mobile devices too).

Ideally, these will be refactored into a single component before 1.0.

md-select-label

closes #2684, closes #1586, closes #3307

BREAKING: `md-select-label` is no longer uses. The select will now
always display the selected value as the text in the `md-option`. This
makes for a better UX for users, as otherwise it was possible to
confuse them.

`md-select` still supports using the `placeholder` attribute outside of
an `md-input-container` but the preferred way of using `md-select` is
now as follows:

```html
<md-input-container>
  <label>State</label>
  <md-select ng-model=""selectedState"">
    <md-option value=""{{state}}"" ng-repeat=""state in states"">
  </md-select>
</md-input-container>

 2. fabToolbar - Creates a list of actions that transform from a floating action button into
    a toolbar.

Todo - The following are tasks we would like to implement in a future release.

 * Update keyboard support in-line with suggestions (i.e. tab to focus, then use arrow keys).
 * Add aria support.
 * Update animations to match new specs.
 * Use $animateCss to clean up code.

Fix opacity bug causing issues in the demo.

Wrap sd demo in a single md-content container.

          $mdInkRipple.attachButtonBehavior(scope, element, options);

When using Closure, it is common to reference Angular module
dependencies by the name property of the module.
This looks like:
```
goog.provide('bar.module');
goog.require('foo.module');
bar.module = angular.module('bar.module', [foo.module.name]);
```
This change makes it possible for this kind of reference instead of
having to refer to the dependent module as a string.

Closes #1044.

By default, now tab content will animate in from whichever direction the
ink-bar is moving.  These animations can be overridden through the
following classes:

When a tab is selected, the following classes are added in order:
1. `md-transition-rtl`: flags the animation as right-to-left
2. `ng-animate`: added at the start of all animations
3. `ng-hide-remove`
4. `ng-hide-remove-active`

When a tab is deselected, the following classes are added in order:
1. `md-transition-rtl`: flags the animation as right-to-left
2. `ng-animate`: added at the start of all animations
3. `ng-hide-add`
4. `ng-hide-add-active`

md-textfloat has been deprecated due to flaws
(explanation in [#547](https://github.com/angular/material/issues/547)).

Now, to create an input you use the native `<input>` and `<textarea>`
elements, with a `<md-input-container>` parent around each
`<input>` or `<textarea>`.

Change your code from this:

```html
<md-textfloat label=""First Name"" ng-model=""firstName""></md-textfloat>
```

To this:

```html
<md-input-container>
  <label>First Name</label>
  <input ng-model=""firstName"">
</md-input-container>

Previously, the `updateAll()` method relied on `$timeout` for scheduling a
digest. This made the possible changes apply after the next rendering and
could possibly lead to extra digests.

Replaces the call to `$timeout` with a call to `$evalAsync()`,
which avoids an extra digest if one is already in progress and also applies
the changes before the next rendering.

`mdUtil`'s custom `cacheFactory` factory, adds/removes keys when
putting/removing a single key, but leaves `keys` untouched when calling
`removeAll()` or `destroy()`. As a result, the following problems arise:

- Keys of destroyed caches continue to take up memory.
- The `keys()` method return incorrect results after calling `removeAll()`
  (i.e. it continues to return the old keys, although they are not present
  in the cache any more).

This commit fixes these issues, by overriding the `removeAll` and
`destroy` methods as well."

Closes #921.

refactor(tabs): added handling for when the tabs are initially hidden

refactor(tabs): switched to 0-based page indexes

refactor(tabs): wires up pagination to use $mdMedia rather than a hard-coded pixel size

In order to accomplish this, I had to move $mdMedia into its own file in the 'material.core' scope.

refactor(tabs): changes per Andrew's feedback

Renames `stretchTabs()` to `shouldStretchTabs()`
Uses `getElementsByTagName()` in place of `querySelectorAll()`
Uses cached version of `angular.element(tabs)`
Adds descriptive comment for `data.page` calculation

BREAKING CHANGE: Themes are no longer defined by linked CSS files.

Themes are now defined through Javascript only. A 'theme template' is
bundled into angular-material.js, and then Javascript is used to
generate theme css for every theme the user defines.

The `default` theme is still shipped with angular-material.

If you used another theme (for example, the `purple` theme), change your code from this:

```html
<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""/themes/purple-theme.css"">
<div md-theme=""purple"">
  <md-button class=""md-primary"">Purple</md-button>
</div>
```

To this:

```js
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngMaterial']);
app.config(function($mdThemingProvider) {
  //will use the colors from default theme for any color not defined.
  $mdThemingProvider.theme('purple')
    .primaryColor('purple');
});
```
```html
<div md-theme=""purple"">
  <md-button class=""md-primary"">Purple</md-button>
</div>
```

For more information, read the updated [theming
documentation](https://material.angularjs.org/#/Theming/01_introduction)."

BREAKING CHANGE: the -phone, -tablet, -pc, and -tablet-landscape
attribute suffixes have been removed and replaced with -sm, -md, and -lg
attributes.

* hide-sm means hide only on small devices (phones).
* hide-md means hide only on medium devices (tablets)
* hide-lg means hide only on large devices (rotated tablets).

Additionally, three new attribute suffixes have been provided for more flexibility:

* hide-gt-sm means hide on devices with size greater than small
 (bigger than phones).
* hide-gt-md means hide on devices with size greater than medium
 (bigger than tablets)
* hide-gt-lg means hide on devices with size greater than large
 (bigger than rotated tablets).

Closes #423. Closes #508. Closes #230. Closes #558.

BREAKING CHANGE: When using the `<md-button>` directive, the compiled
element will now be a normal `<a> or `<button>` element with the class
`md-button` on it. There will no longer be `<md-button>` elements in
your final DOM.

This means that any css referencing the `md-button` element selector
should now reference the `.md-button` class selector.

```css
md-button {

To this:

The dangling links being reported by the link checking processor were actually
valid warnings.  This commit re-enables the link checker and fixes those dangling
links.

- the project is not using componentGroups so this processor is disabled.
- the project is not using module pages but the ones being generated were using a
template that was appropriate for the angular.js project, so it had invalid
content as well as links
- the index.html template contained an unnecessary invalid href, since the link
is being handled by an ng-click handler.

**For future reference, it is easier to disable a processor by simply setting
its `$enabled` property to `false` - this works for all processors**"

Don't use nested `<input>`. This is ok as:
* simplifies the usage of radio buttons
* we already render the buttons ourselves with canvas
* polymer radio component also does not use an <input> internally

Place `ng-model` on `<material-radio-group>`
* simplifies the usage of radio buttons
* before it needed to be repeated on every radio button

Don't create scopes for the buttons
* helps preventing newbie problems with `ng-model`"
