BGMApp has to set BGMDevice, and often also the Null Device for a short
time, as the systemwide default audio device, which makes CoreAudio put
them in the preferred devices list in its Plist file. And since the list
is limited to three devices, it only gives us one or two usable ones.
Ideally, CoreAudio just wouldn't add our devices to its list, but I
don't think we can prevent that.

As a partial workaround, we now store our own copy of the preferred
devices list without our devices, which BGMApp can use to figure out
which devices were pushed out of CoreAudio's list by our devices.

This doesn't fix the problem entirely because our devices still take up
room in CoreAudio's list when BGMApp is closed, but I think that would
be harder to solve.

See #167.

Also:
 - Handle setting the initial output device in BGMPreferredOutputDevices
   instead of BGMAudioDeviceManager.
 - Fix a crash in BGMOutputVolumeMenuItem::dealloc caused by using
   dispatch_sync to dispatch to the main queue while running on the main
   queue.
 - Fix a crash in BGMPreferredOutputDevices if

   doesn't exist.
 - Add Swinsian to the list of music players in the README. (I must have
   forgotten to do that when I added support for it.)"

which is sent because BGMDriver's Null Device is enabled and then
disabled as part of changing the output device.

In BGMPlayThrough, wait much longer for our IOProcs to stop themselves

between output devices with and without controls while playing audio
would occasionally cause one of the IOProcs to take too long to stop
itself.

The Applescript that opened System Preferences at the end of the process
was failing to find the ""Sound"" pane. It might have been because I don't
have OS X set to English, but it's always worked for me in the past.
Either way, it's less fragile to use the ID and it fixes the problem (on
my machine, at least).

Also, added a short pause before restarting coreaudiod because the step
before that makes Finder to play a short sound. It probably wouldn't
cause any problems, but why risk it?"

BGMApp is failing to build for some people with the Clang error message
""Could not read profile: Unsupported profiling format version"". See #4.

I think this might be caused by building with an older version of Xcode,
but I'm far from sure about that. BGMApp uses <0.5% CPU, so it's not
worth using an optimization profile if it's causing anyone problems."

The BGMApp project now builds an XPC service bundle called BGMXPCHelper,
which vends a Mach service that BGMApp and BGMDriver can use to
communicate. This will hopefully be useful for some of the tasks HAL
notifications aren't suited to.

In this commit, BGMDriver uses the XPC helper when starting IO, to wait
until BGMApp is ready for playthrough. BGMApp can only start playthrough
when the output hardware is ready for IO. BGMDriver can now tell the HAL
when we're ready for IO, which means we don't have to keep the output
hardware running all the time (or drop frames or increase latency).

The end result is that playthrough doesn't waste CPU time while idle any
more. This also means that now playthrough won't prevent the system from
sleeping when idle."
