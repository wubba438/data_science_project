Also added Pipfile(.lock) prior to the remaining source, improving Docker image cacheability.

Git is also required to fetch pyyaml.

This results in more deterministic and reproducible image builds, since httpbin dependencies
are installed using locked versions from Pipfile.lock before httpbin is itself installed.

Fixed #493."

the query-string if it is present which means it is necessary in our

Because it is not present in Flask 0.11. We keep merging the headers from the `headers` variable with the headers from the `response.headers`, because changing the response may change the headers, especially the `Content-Length` header. In Flask 0.11 this `Content-Length` header is no longer present in the `response.headers`, so we check whether the `response.data` has changed.

Using url_for is useful if httpbin is served under a prefix path.  For
example, we can serve httpbin under http://example.org/httpbin.
Previously, we have to replace all hard coded paths, which produces
many diffs, and it makes hard to upgrade httpbin from source.  This
commit uses url_for to resolve correct path even if prefix path is
used.  For digest auth, we have to prepend request.script_root to
request.path to pass authentication."

allows specifying a ""Range"" header, which allows the client
to ask for a specific portion of the resource.

to break compatibility with any clients that expect range

10.4.2 401 Unauthorized

The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a
WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.47) containing a challenge applicable
to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable
Authorization header field (section 14.8). If the request already included
Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that authorization
has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains the same
challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted
authentication at least once, then the user SHOULD be presented the entity that
was given in the response, since that entity might include relevant diagnostic
information. HTTP access authentication is explained in ""HTTP Authentication:
Basic and Digest Access Authentication"" [43].

10.4.4 403 Forbidden

The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization
will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated. If the request method was
not HEAD and the server wishes to make public why the request has not been
fulfilled, it SHOULD describe the reason for the refusal in the entity. If the
server does not wish to make this information available to the client, the
status code 404 (Not Found) can be used instead."
