Code:
```php
$anonClass = new class($arg) {};
```

As anonymous classes have a distinct token, it makes sense to me to assign that token as the parenthesis owner, along the same lines as is done for anonymous functions.

The main difference is that for anonymous classes, the parenthesis are optional.

Assigning an owner for them can not be done from within the `Tokenizer::createTokenMap()` as at that point in time the `PHP::processAdditional()` method hasn't run yet, so the token is still a `T_CLASS`.

It can however be adjusted from within the `PHP::processAdditional()` method when the `T_CLASS` token is changed to a `T_ANON_CLASS` token.

This commit implements this.

This means that for the `class` token in the above code snippet will now have a `parenthesis_owner`, `parenthesis_opener` and `parenthesis_closer` in the `$tokens` array.
The parenthesis opener and closer will both now also have the `parenthesis_owner` key, in addition to the `parenthesis_opener` and `parenthesis_closer` keys which they already had.

Instead of testing this via existing sniffs, I have chosen to add a new set of `Core` tests for specific tokenizer issues, with the tests for this change being the first set of tests added.

Includes:
* Adding the `T_ANON_CLASS` token to the `Tokens::$parenthesisOpeners` array.
* Removing the `T_ANON_CLASS` from the ""additional tokens indicating that parenthesis are not arbitrary"" list in the `Generic.WhiteSpace.ArbitraryParenthesesSpacing` sniff."

This adds a new `getTargetToken()` method which can retrieve the target token for testing with higher precision than the (duplicate) code which was so far used in the individual test methods.

The improvements this method offers are:
* Avoid test leaking/contamination.
    If/when the token to start the test from was retrieved by doing a `findNext()` from the delimiter comment, a typo could cause a token from the *next* test to be used for the testing instead of the target token.
    If the expected results would be the same for both tests, this would go completely unnoticed.
    This is now no longer possible.
    The only requirement is that the delimiter comments start with `/* test...`.
* No more token counting when setting up the unit tests, just pass the target token type constant to this method and it will get you the correct token.
    This also allows for not having to jump through hoops when deciding where to place the delimiter comment for the test.
* If the token a test looks for is a `T_STRING` or text based token, the optional `$tokenContent` allows for selecting the correct token, even when there are several of the same type in the test case line."

Refactor to remove duplicate code.

This new class abstracts out the `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods which were included in nearly all the utility method test classes.

The methods have been changed to static `setUpBeforeClass()` and `tearDownAfterClass()` with a static property as the initial processed `File` doesn't change between tests, so there is no need to tokenize and process the unit test case file for each test individually.

This makes the utility method unit tests significantly faster as well as lower the memory usage.

Additionally, the _standard_ against which the files are processed has been changed from `Generic` (75 sniffs) to `PSR1` (7 sniffs), which again makes the unit test suite for the Core utility functions significantly faster.

The current implementation allows for only one test case file per utility method test file, but as the utility method tests are not sniff specific, adding additional tests files for a method if needed, should not be a problem.

By default test case files are expected to be PHP `inc` files. Child classes can overload the static `$fileExtension` property when the test case file is a JS or CSS file."

The sniff had a potential fixer conflict with the `SuperfluousWhiteSpace` and the `EndFileNewline` sniffs.

It looks like the `XMLWriter` extension does not respect the OS-specific `PHP_EOL` character, but always uses `\n`, though I have not been able to test this on various OS-es to confirm.

With the above in mind, I have created a fix which contains some redundancy, but should be stable on all OS-es, including if/when the PHP native issue would be fixed.

Note: this fix does not introduce code-wrapping as that would probably reduce the readability of the code too much.
Instead, the line will just be longer than other lines.

Idea: should this class respect a `report_width` if set by the user either in their `CodeSniffer.conf` or via the command-line ?"

While validating a custom ruleset against the PHPCS XSD schema, I realized that the `phpcs-only` and the `phpcbf-only` attributes were not accounted for in the schema.

Ref: https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Annotated-Ruleset#selectively-applying-rules

This PR fixes that.

Notes:
* I have added the `attributeGroup` to nearly all XML elements, with the exception of:
    - The toplevel `ruleset` and the `description` element as per the documentation.
    - The `autoload` element as not using autoload for either `phpcs` or `phpcbf` would most likely break the standard using the element.
    - The `message` element of the `ruleType` as this only applies to `phpcs` anyway.
    - The individual `element` nodes within an array `<property>` group.
* Includes adjusting the `extend` attribute for the `properties` node from type `string` to `boolean`."

As PSR-12 is now in review again, an update of the ruleset to reflect the current version was needed.

* Updated all inline documentation texts with the texts as currently in PSR-12, as it is in review.
* Added any new statements which were added to PSR-12.
* Added the `Generic.WhiteSpace.IncrementDecrementSpacing` sniff to satisfy the `There MUST NOT be any whitespace between the increment/decrement operators and the variable being incremented/decremented.` rule.
* Added the `Squiz.WhiteSpace.CastSpacing` sniff to satisfy the `There MUST NOT be any spaces inside the type casting parentheses.` rule.

Note: The `5.3.1`/`5.3.2` split is my doing as it is otherwise completely unclear what the difference is between the two statements.

While updating the inline documentation, I noticed a few issues in PSR-12 itself and have opened PRs to fix those. If and when those would be accepted, the inline documentation in the ruleset will need to be updated (again)."

Nightly has become PHP 8.0 since PHP 7.4 has been branched, so to continue to also test against PHP 7.4, it needs to be added separately.

As PHPStan can't currently be run (yet) on PHP 8, the environment variable for it has also been moved to PHP 7.4.

Refs:
* https://twitter.com/nikita_ppv/status/1089839541828112384
* https://twitter.com/nikita_ppv/status/1094897743594770433

PHPUnit 8 adds `void` return type declarations to the PHPUnit methods used by PHPCS, making it neigh impossible to make the unit test suite cross-version compatible for the PHP versions supported by PHPCS.

Officially, PHPUnit 7 is compatible with PHP 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. However for the functionality used by the PHPCS test suite, it looks to be compatible with PHP 7.4 as well (for now).
Ref: https://phpunit.de/supported-versions.html

For this reason, for Travis images which come natively with PHPUnit 8 (PHP >= 7.2), PHPUnit 7 needs to be installed via Composer.
This is not necessary for older PHP versions and skipping the `composer install` when it's not needed, will make the build a little faster.

Note:  Doing the `composer install` in the `before_install` step will show a build as ""errored"" instead of ""failed"" if something would go wong with this install, which is more representative of the real build status.

As for `nightly`/PHP 8:
* The Travis native PHPUnit version for `nightly` is PHPUnit 8, which will not work.
* Running `composer install` for PHPUnit on `nightly` currently installs PHPUnit 4.1.6. Most likely because the PHPUnit 4.x `composer.json` file did not yet contain a PHP requirement, while any higher PHPUnit versions do. Anyways, that will most definitely not work.
* Running `composer install` for PHPUnit with a requirement of PHPUnit 7.x will also not work as PHPUnit 7 will not install on PHP 8 based on the PHPUnit `composer.json` file.

All in all, the unit tests can not currently be run on PHP 8.

When the PHPUnit build step would be active on `nightly` it would automatically fail the build. This would mask any errors in other build steps. So, for now, I've elected to skip running the unit tests on PHP 8 (`nightly`).
This will allow all the other build tests which *can* be run on PHP 8 to still be tested and report appropriate statuses."

As discussed in 2387, there are dedicated sniffs for checking the spacing around assignment operators:
* `PSR12.Operators.OperatorSpacing`
* `Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing`

Both of these are more comprehensive and more appropriate to use than the limited assignment operator spacing check in this sniff.

Removing the assignment operator spacing checks from this sniff, lowers the risk of fixer conflicts regarding operator spacing and gets rid of duplicate notices in the `PSR12` and `Squiz` standard and inappropriate notices for the `PEAR`, `PSR2` and `Zend` standard.

#### Make the sniff more efficient by sniffing for fewer tokens

The `Tokens::$functionNameTokens` array includes a number of tokens which will never trigger errors from this sniff as they only expect one parameter. Think: `empty()`, `exit()`.
However, as the tokens are registered for the sniff, the sniff will be triggered each time those tokens are encountered.

I have changed the `register()` method to only register the tokens which will/could actually trigger errors, making the sniff more efficient.

    This is the same change as was made for other sniffs in 2290, which I'd kept apart as I was afraid it would conflict with this PR otherwise.
* Adding extra unit test documenting the behaviour of the fixers with indented docblocks.
    The fact that the alignment/indentation of the fixes is off is not addressed in this PR and IMO doesn't need to be addressed by this sniff in the first place as the `Squiz.Commenting.DocCommentAlignment` sniff can handle that.

[Sniff completeness series PR]

Notes:
* The sniff, up to now, required `rhino` to run, but the `jshint` tool can also be run directly when installed via `npm`. I've now adjusted the sniff to allow for that, which makes providing the `rhino` path optional.
* It may be worth it to check if `jshint` is available on Travis by default or do a `npm i jshint` in the Travis `before_script` section to install it, so the sniff will actually be tested properly."

Note: PHP internally doesn't always correctly register functions as deprecated, so this sniff will only work when it has (as the information is otherwise not available to the Reflection extension).

Some trial and error showed that the two functions now in the tests are correctly registered, but numerous other functions I tried to add to the test case file failed as PHP didn't provide the expected information."

[Fixer conflicts series PR]

Fixer conflict can be reproduced by running the below command against master:
phpcbf -p -s ./src/Standards/Squiz/Tests/WhiteSpace/FunctionOpeningBraceSpaceUnitTest.inc --standard=Squiz

Introduced by me via 2110, which was included in the 3.3.2 release, and didn't take global functions straight after a PHP open tag into account. Mea Culpa.

Basically, when a function is on the first line after a PHP open tag at the start of the file, the whitespace would be added before the open tag, not before the function.
This in turn causes a conflict with the `SuperfluousWhiteSpace` sniff which will try to remove whitespace before the open tag at the start of file.

While adding unit tests for this, I also discovered a second, more serious bug, where, when there were too _many_ blank lines between a PHP open tag at the start of a file and the first function, the PHP open tag would be removed altogether, which would cause the file to be regarded as inline HTML.

These situations were not covered by unit tests yet and all need separate files to be tested properly. These tests have now been added to prevent this issue from reoccuring in the future."

This PR adds a custom script which will validate the `<contents>` and `<phprelease>`  tags in the PEAR-targeted `package.xml` file.

The script executes the following check to verify the validity of the tags:
* Check that every file mentioned in the `<contents>` tag exists.
* Check that the value of the `role` attribute for a `<file>` tag is valid.
* Check that the value of the `baseinstalldir` attribute for a `<file>` tag is valid.
* Checks that all files in the `src` and `tests` directories are listed in the `<contents>` tag.
* Check that every file mentioned in the `<phprelease>` tags exists.
* Check that the value of the `as` attribute for a `<install>` tag is valid.
* Checks that all files in the `tests` directory are listed in the `<phprelease>` tags.

More/improved checks can be added if/when needed, but this should prevent the most common issues.

This check only needs to be run on one build as the results won't change between PHP versions.
For that reason, I've elected to add it to one of the `CUSTOM_INI` runs to balance out the runs some more.

As the PHP version makes no difference to the `xmllint` check, I've moved that to a lower PHP version, so we can use a higher (faster) PHP version for this additional check."

In the WordPressCS  repo we received a bug report from someone using PHPCS 3.4.0 but missing the `Generic.WhiteSpace.LanguageConstructSpacing` sniff.

Turned out that that sniff is missing from the `package.xml` file which is why it's not available when someone is using a PEAR install of PHPCS.

I've now done a comprehensive check of all relevant files in the repo versus the files listed in the `<contents>` tag of the `package.xml` file and found some more discrepancies with this commit as a result.

As this basically means that the PEAR install is currently ""broken"" with regards to the `Code` report (PHPCS 3.0), the `Generic.Formatting.SpaceBeforeCast` sniff (PHPCS 3.4.0) as well as the `Generic.WhiteSpace.LanguageConstructSpacing` sniff (PHPCS 3.3.0), this should be considered a hotfix."

Array union `+` is much faster than `array_merge()`, though the behaviour is different.

The differences are:

-- | Array union | Array merge
-- | -- | --
Numeric keys | Will keep the keys which already exist | Will renumber & add keys for all values
String keys | Will keep the keys which already exist | Will keep the keys which already exist
Values | Will *not overwrite* existing value | Will *overwrite* existing value

As the arrays which are defined in the `Tokens` class have the same keys as well as values, using array union on those token arrays will be:
* more efficient than using a function call to `array_merge()`;
* will auto-deduplicate the arrays, so no need for a call to `array_unique()`;
* and the result will be the same.

Similarly, using straight assignments to an array is also more efficient than using `array_merge()` when it's a small number of assignments."

The PSR 12 standard (currently) says nothing about whether or not spaces within type casts are allowed.

As it was, the `PSR12.Keywords.ShortFormTypeKeywords` sniff would throw a false positive for a short form type cast like `( bool )` and ""fix"" it by removing the spaces, which is not the concern of this sniff.

If at some point the PSR12 standard would take a stand about spaces within type casts, the `Squiz.WhiteSpace.CastSpacing` sniff could be added to check & fix these issues.

In the mean time, the `ShortFormTypeKeywords` sniff should be space-agnostic.

This PR takes care of that.

It also makes the error message slightly more descriptive by being explicit about the type cast found in the error message.

While the `libxml` error messages are far from perfect, they at least give some clue as to where to look for the error in a ruleset file.

This PR changes two things:
1. Previously, a PHP warning would also be thrown for a ruleset of a standard which is not used in the current run.
    This warning is now silenced.
2. However, for the standards and rulesets actually _used_ by the current run, any potential warnings are made more readable and will now also mention the file in which they were encountered.
    Previously the output would be along the lines of:
    ```
    Warning: simplexml_load_string(): Entity: line 82: parser error : Opening and ending tag mismatch: rule line 80 and rue in /path/to/PHP_CodeSniffer/src/Util/Standards.php on line 119
    Warning: simplexml_load_string():       </rue> in /path/to/PHP_CodeSniffer/src/Util/Standards.php on line 119
    Warning: simplexml_load_string():             ^ in /path/to/PHP_CodeSniffer/src/Util/Standards.php on line 119
    ```
    Now, it will look like:
    ```
    ERROR: Ruleset /path/to/ruleset.xml is not valid
    - On line 82, column 10: Opening and ending tag mismatch: rule line 80 and rue

[Fixer conflicts series PR]

When a JS file contains a `//` comment on the very first line of the file, the fixer unnecessarily added a new line before it, which would cause a fixer conflict with the `Squiz.WhiteSpace.SuperfluousWhitespace` sniff.

The fixer conflict can be reproduced by checking out just the new `PostStatementCommentUnitTest.2.js` test case file from this PR and running the sniff - as it is currently in `master` - over it using the `Squiz` standard.

`phpcbf -s ./Squiz/Tests/Commenting/PostStatementCommentUnitTest.2.js --standard=Squiz -vv`

This commit fixes the fixer conflict and adds a new unit test file guarding against it.

Additional notes:
* Added minor defensive coding improvements.
* Added tests confirming the correct handling of post statement comments for PHP closures.
* Added tests confirming the correct handling of the new PHPCS annotations.
* Removed some redundant break statements from the unit test file."

[Fixer conflict series PR]

The check to prevent the sniff from kicking in during live coding/at the end of a file wasn't stable enough and allowed the sniff to kick in anyway if there was a new line or comment after the control structure keyword.
This, in turn, would cause a fixer conflict with `EndFileNewLine` sniffs and - depending on the control structure - other sniffs.

The fixer conflict can be reproduced using this code sample:
```php
<?php
foreach

```
and this command:
`phpcbf ./testfile.php --standard=Squiz

And while PSR2 does not generate a fixer conflict for this code sample, incorrect fixes would still be made resulting in (more) parse errors.
Using this code sample:
```php
<?php
for

```

Using the following command:
`phpcbf ./testfile.php --standard=PSR2`

This would be fixed to:
```php
for {
    ;
}
```

While rare to come across this in practice, the sniff should be stable and prevent this situation from ever occurring.
By changing the 'live coding' check to look at more than just the next token, this issue is prevented.

Includes unit test demonstrating the issue."

The `Generic.ControlStructures.InlineControlStructure` sniff did not handle live coding situations/parse errors and would try to fix the file anyway.

This causes a fixer conflict. This is now fixed by adding a number of checks against parse errors/live coding.

The fixer conflict can be seen by checking out any of the new test case files and running the following command:
`phpcbf -ps ./src/Standards/Generic/Tests/ControlStructures/InlineControlStructureUnitTest.3.inc --standard=squiz -vv`

At the start of the fixer loop you can see that the sniff adds `{;}` which then causes other sniffs to kick in and conflict.
Some of these other sniffs also still need fixes for this, but this PR addresses the part which is in the `Generic.ControlStructures.InlineControlStructure` sniff.

The sniff contains fixers, but didn't have `fixed` files.

While I was at it, I've reviewed the sniff and applied any improvements I could think of:

    If found, the error will still be thrown, but won't be auto-fixed.
    Includes new unit test.
* Simplified the ""found indent"" length determination.
     This will prevent the sniff throwing false positives for correctly indented, tab indented braces and from replacing tabs with spaces (not the concern of this sniff).
     This should also lower the risk of fixer conflicts if/when this sniff is used in a tab-based standard.
     To test this, a secondary test case file has been added which is tested with `tabWidth=4`.
* Added tests documenting the sniff and fixer behaviour when too little/too much indentation is found for indented class declarations.
* Added unit test to document the behaviour of the sniff when there is a comment on a line of its own between the class declaration and the opening brace.
    Includes minor change to the relevant error message text for accuracy.
* Added unit test to test the parse error warning, which was previously untested.
    This test has been added to the new second test case file to keep it easy to add new tests to the main test case file.

The sniff contains fixers, but didn't have a `fixed` file.

While I was add it, I've reviewed the sniff and applied any improvements I could think of:
* For the `Before` error code, the sniff would report on a `tab` being found if the whitespace length was 1, but not a space. This meant that for a ""3 space"" whitespace token, it would also report as `tab`.
    I've now changed the `$length` determination to be more accurate.
* The  fixer for the `Before` error will now fix the whitespace between in one go if there is more than one whitespace token.
    Previously, it would replace the first preceding whitespace token with a space, which in effect left any additional new lines in place as the fixer would not be triggered again.
* While the `ContentBefore` error states ""Opening brace should be the last content on the line"", the way the code was, allowed for trailing comments on the line of the opening brace.
     I've elected not to change this behaviour, but have documented it with a unit test.
* The fixer for the `AfterNesting` error would remove the first non-whitespace token after the opening brace if too many lines after the opener were found. This changes the meaning of the style declaration and/or could remove comments.
    The existing unit test on line 33 demonstrates this, as well as the new unit tests on line 88 and 95.
* The fixer for `AfterNesting` would also inadvertently remove line indentation. Indentation is not the concern of this sniff, so should be left alone.
* The `AfterNesting` check would also **not** report an error if the line between the original opening brace and the nested style declaration, contained a comment.
* Lastly, the handling of trailing comments was inconsistent with the handling of these in the `ContentBefore` part, i.e. for `ContentBefore` they would be allowed, but if the `AfterNesting` error was triggered, the fixer would move them.
* Improved the resilience of the sniff against syntax/parse errors and during live coding. This prevents an `Undefined index: bracket_closer` error.
* Minor other defensive coding improvements.

In effect, this constitutes a complete rewrite of this sniff.

Includes additional unit tests covering all fixes."

Minified files are not processed by the tokenizer and when such files are encountered PHPCS throws an `Internal.Tokenizer.Exception` warning.

In the progress report these files show up with a `W` because of this warning.

However, as the file isn't really processed at all, indicating these files as ""skipped"" with an `S` in the progress report seems more appropriate.

Also, when there is a tokenizer error, the rest of the processing in the `File::process()` method can be skipped.

This commit makes that change.

The existing warning is left in place, but the progress report will now report these files with an `S`.

To test this change:
* Grab any project with minified CSS and/or JS files.
* While on `master`, run `phpcs -p . --standard=PSR2 --report=summary,source` on the project and take note of the `summary` report showing minified files with 1 warning and the `source` report showing `[ ] Internal ... Tokenizer #`.
* Now switch to this branch and run the same command again.
    The source and summary reports will be the same, but for the progress line, the files which have the tokenizer warning should now show as `S` instead of `W`."

...while I would expect the class identifier to be tokenized as one T_STRING `HelpWidgetType-new-bug-title` instead.

Efficiency fix. Prevents the fixer having to be triggered multiple times when, for instance, whitespace + newline + whitespace or several new lines are found between the object operator and the token before/after.

Existing unit tests already cover this change.

The effect of the change can be seen by running `phpcbf -v --standard=Squiz ./src/Standards/Squiz.Tests/WhiteSpace/ObjectOperatorSpacingUnitTest.inc --sniffs=Squiz.WhiteSpaceObjectOperatorSpacing` first on `master` (3 passes needed), then on this branch (2 passes needed).

Includes minor improvement to an existing unit test checking the handling of whitespace in combination with comments."

IMO the feature request made in 2198 is unequivocally covered by PSR2:

> Visibility MUST be declared on all **_properties_** and methods; `abstract` and `final` MUST be declared before the visibility; `static` MUST be declared after the visibility.
Ref: https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/#1-overview

With that in mind, I've adjusted the `PSR2.Classes.PropertyDeclaration` sniff to include a check for the modifier keyword order.

Includes unit tests.

* As the sniff didn't have any fixers up to now, I've added a `.fixed` file.
* The fixer tries to gracefully handle any comments found between the keywords and the property variable.
* The sniff now defers to the `File::getMemberProperties()` method for the information on whether scope (and static) is specified.
    This also fixes a bug where the visibility was incorrectly not recognized as present when it was declared on another line. See unit test on line 22.
* Added a unit test to cover PHP4 style static properties and documented an intentional parse error in the test case file.
* Additionally, this PR contains some minor defensive coding improvements to the sniff.

Fixes 2198"

This fixes the error messages being thrown twice.

Additional notes:
* For methods in anonymous classes, the error message would read `Public method name ""::nested_function"" is not in camel caps format` which could be considered confusing.
    I've changed this to now read: `Public method name ""[Anonymous Class]::nested_function"" is not in camel caps format`
* Class and method names in PHP are case _in_sensitive. While the sniff took that into account for the magic methods, it did not when checking for PHP4 style constructors/destructors.
     This has now been fixed by lowercasing both the class name as well as the function name before comparing them.

Includes unit tests."

When `$allowMultipleArguments` is set to false and the sniff would encounter a trailing PHPCS annotation in a function call, it would incorrectly throw a _""Only one argument is allowed per line in a multi-line function call""_ error.

The sniff did handle normal trailing comments correctly, so only needed a minimal adjustment to allow for the PHPCS annotations.

Additional notes:
* This commit also adds a few unit test cases using trailing comma's in function calls - as allowed per PHP 7.3 - to confirm that the sniff handles these correctly and safeguard this for the future.
* Also includes a minor unit test case documentation fix."

Based on the bug report and test case in issue 2178, I've had a look at this sniff.
Turns out the `processTokensWithinScope()` method gets called for each whitelisted scope a `T_FUNCTION` token exists in.

In effect, this means that the first time it gets called for the `nested()` method, it is because it is within the scope of the `Nested` class, the second time the function gets called, it is for the method being in the scope of the anonymous class.

The fix I've now applied checks that the scope for which the method is called is actually the deepest scope first and bows out if it's not. This fixes the false positive.

Additionally, the `loadFunctionNamesInScope()` method would examine every token within the class and the resulting function list would therefore include the names of functions which were nested.
This would lead to false negatives as a `__construct()` method in a nested class would be regarded as the `__construct()` method of the higher level class and the expected error would not be thrown.

I've fixes this by having the `loadFunctionNamesInScope()` method skip to the end of a function after adding the function name to the list, which effectively will prevent the names of nested functions from getting into the list.
This should also make the method more efficient as it now examines a lot less tokens.

Additional notes:
* Class and method names in PHP are case _in_sensitive. While the sniff tried to take that into account by using `strcasecmp()`, the `in_array()` check and the check for the extended parent class name were *not* done in a case-insensitive manner leading - again - to incorrect results.
     This has now been fixed by lowercasing both the class name as well as all function names before comparing them.
* Use strict comparison for `in_array()` to prevent issues with type juggling.
* Includes minor fix to an existing unit test - the sniff logic contains a ""caching"" mechanism for the list of function names gathered which is based on the name of the class.
    As the name of the class on line 32 was the same as the name of the class for the preceding unit test case, the function name list did not get refreshed and therefore the unit test wasn't testing things correctly.

Includes unit tests for all fixes.

New sniff to check that there are no spaces (or comments) between an incrementor/decrementor and the variable it applies to.

The sniff can examine both PHP as well as JS files for this, though I suspect there may be some false positive reports for JS at some point as `T_STRING` is quite a generic token to check for.

Includes unit tests.
Includes auto-fixer.
Includes code-consistency metrics.

I've made a conscious decision to not make the number of spaces accepted between the in/decrementor and the variable configurable as it is a widely accepted convention that there should be no spaces between them.
If it would be so desired, I can add a public property to make this configurable.

A variable assignment in the condition of a `while` loop may well be enclosed in additional parenthesis to prevent issues with operator precedence when comparing the assigned value within the same condition.

Example:
```php
while ( ( $csvdata = fgetcsv( $handle, 2000, $separator ) ) !== false ) {}
```

Previously only the lowest level `parenthesis_owner` would be examined to determine whether or not to report this as an error. Now, for `while` loops only, the parenthesis owners of all nested parenthesis will be examined.

Examining them early on in the sniff as the rest of the logic is superfluous if the assignment should be ignored anyway.

Includes unit test."

As the metric keys may be numeric, the `SORT_NATURAL` flag (introduced in PHP 5.4) will ensure that numbers with equal counts will be sorted properly, i.e.:
Without this these would be sorted like:
```

As discussed in 2102, this PR makes the following changes to improve the readability of the `Info` report for multi-line metrics:

1. Start the first metric value on a new line.
2. Align the arrows, and by extension the counts, of the metrics.
3. Move the totals to a separate line underneath the list of metric values.
4. Right align the counts.
5. Add thousands separators to the counts.
6. Right align the percentages.

As of PHP 7.3, using `continue` to target a `switch` control structure will throw an `E_WARNING`.

Applying `continue` to a `switch` is equivalent to using `break` and more often than not, a `continue` targeting a higher level control structure is actually intended.

To target the higher level control structure, a numeric argument has to be passed to `continue`.

Refs:
* https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/3364
* https://wiki.php.net/rfc/continue_on_switch_deprecation

This change has been recently committed to PHP itself and will break the build against `nightly` for the current `master` already. See: https://travis-ci.org/jrfnl/PHP_CodeSniffer/jobs/401533444 (this branch, but without commits, so equal to the current `master`).

This PR fixes the instances of this in PHPCS.
All these switches are nested in other control structures, but end the switch end the scope closer of the outer control structure, so using `break` in these cases would be equivalent to using `continue 2`.

FYI: The PHPCompatibility standard will include a sniff to detect this in the near future."

The original sort order of the file names in the summary report was alphabetic and did not take subdirectories into account.

This could result in a list like:
```
dir/afile/subdir/file.php
dir/afile.php
dir/b/subdir/file.php
dir/cfile.php

The change proposed in this PR sorts the file names in a way that the directory layout is taken into account, so the above list would now display as:

[Fixer conflicts series PR]

This PR addresses a fixer conflict between the `Generic.Functions.FunctionCallArgumentSpacing` and the `PEAR.Functions.FunctionCallSignature` sniffs when these sniffs encounter a multi-line function call.

The fixer conflict can be reproduced by running:
`phpcbf -p -s ./test.php --standard=PEAR --sniffs=Generic.Functions.FunctionCallArgumentSpacing,PEAR.Functions.FunctionCallSignature`
against the following code:
```php
my_function_call(
    'a'
    /* Comment */
    ,'b'
    , 'c' // Comment.
    ,'d'
    ,'e' // phpcs:ignore Standard.Category.Sniff -- for reasons.
    , 'f'
);
```

If given half a chance, the fixer in the `Generic.Functions.FunctionCallArgumentSpacing` sniff would change multi-line function calls to single-line.

This PR fixes this.

[Fixer conflicts series PR]

Fixer conflict can be reproduced by running the below command against `master`:
`phpcbf -p -s ./src/Standards/Squiz/Tests/Arrays/ArrayDeclarationUnitTest.1.inc --standard=Squiz`

When there is a comment after an operator, the `Squiz.Commenting.PostStatementComment` sniff and the `Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing` sniffs would conflict, with the `PostStatementComment` sniff demanding a new line and the `OperatorSpacing` sniff demanding exactly one space.

Along the same lines, if the next content is a PHPCS annotation on the next line, moving the annotation to be on the same line as the operator could change its meaning.

I've chosen to fix this by throwing the error, but blocking auto-fixing when the next thing after the operator is a comment/annotation and the whitespace found is a new line.

[Fixer conflicts series PR]

Fixer conflict can be reproduced by running the below command against master:
phpcbf -p -s ./src/Standards/Generic/Tests/Files/LineEndingsUnitTest.inc --standard=Squiz

Basically, the `Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing` sniff demands 2 blank lines between functions, while the `Squiz.PHP.EmbeddedPHP` sniff demands no blank lines at the start of an embedded PHP block, which causes a fixer conflict if a function is declared at the top of an embedded PHP block.

To fix this, I've given precedence to the `EmbeddedPHP` sniff - i.e. no blank lines between the PHP open tag and the start of the function declaration. The `FunctionSpacing` will now ignore functions at the start of an embedded PHP block.

Includes unit test."

When a function name would contain more than one subsequent underscore, the `explode()` call will create entries containing an empty string in the `$nameBits` array.

The proposed fix will remove those empty entries before testing each `$bit`.
([`array_filter()` called without callback](http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-filter.php#example-6090) will remove everything which after juggling would evaluate to `false`).

**Note:** The resulting suggested `$newName` for the function will no longer contain a double underscore either.

If it would be desired to allow the double underscore, the alternative would be to change the `if ($bit{0} !== strtoupper($bit{0}))` condition to `if ($bit !== '' && $bit{0} !== strtoupper($bit{0}))`. This would also require an adjustment in the inner loop which creates the new package name.

Includes unit test.

Fixes 2027"

This allows for external standards to provide portable custom reports while installed in an arbitrary directory.

* The external standard has to make sure it includes an `<autoload>` directive in the ruleset and sort out the loading of the custom report classes through a `spl_autoload_register()`-ed autoloader.
* The name of the custom report class can be provided either on the command line using `--report=...` or via the ruleset using `<arg name=""report"" value=""..""/>`.
* The name of the custom report class can be either the Fully Qualified report class name òr just the class name.
    - The FQN does not have to be prefixed with an `\`, but things will work just fine if it is.
    - If just the class name is provided, PHPCS will try to find the report in any of the namespaces as registered by the installed standards.
    - If the report class is not found in any of these, a `DeepExitException` will be thrown.

I actually profiled and micro-benchmarked this line. I found that rtrim() is by far the fastest when applied on real-life content, 10 times faster than str_replace() and 2 times faster than ltrim(). Why? Because real-life code typically contains way more strings that are not exclusively made of whitespace. This check needs to be fast for these non-whitespace cases. Furthermore, if a string contains whitespace, that's typically not at the end of the string. rtrim() immediately stops doing anything in this case, while ltrim() needs to trim all tabs from the beginning of the string first, and str_replace() needs to replace all tabs, even tabs in the middle of the string that are not relevant for this check.

So this change is all about bailing out as early as possible."

As discussed in 1931, moving a trailing `phpcs:ignore` annotation to the next line changes its meaning, which is what currently happens when the `ContentAfterBrace` error is triggered by one of the new PHPCS annotations in the `Generic.Functions.OpeningFunctionBraceKernighanRitchie` and `Generic.Functions.OpeningFunctionBraceBsdAllman` sniffs.

For the `Generic.Functions.OpeningFunctionBraceBsdAllman` sniff, this also impacts the fixer of the `BraceOnSameLine` errror which could also move the comment down.

This PR fixes that.

For this fix, I've chosen to ignore *all* the PHPCS annotations, not just the `phpcs:ignore` one. If so desired, I can change the PR to only make an exception for a trailing `phpcs:ignore` comment and to move `phpcs:disable/enable/set` comments to the next line, just like ""normal"" comments.

Includes unit tests."

This simplifies the fixes which were previously committed to fix 1870 and 1848, which were released in `3.2.3`.

Both those fixes try to prevent the sniff getting confused over (potentially) multi-line value assignments, such as closures and arrays.

The simplification removes the previously added code in favour of skipping to the end of a statement as soon as an assignment operator has been found.

This might also make the sniff marginally faster as the tokens between the assignment operator and the end of the statement will no longer be examined.

N.B.: The reason for going one back from the end of the assignment, is that otherwise the code addressing the unit test on line 220 / added in commit 579d39cac3163bdf05ce1b50a7e470acd452735b would not be triggered, leading to incorrect results.

Side-note: I think it would be a good idea to add unit tests for the `File::findEndOfStatement()` method."

I've seen similar issues now in several external standards, where people are receiving a `Cannot declare class Standard\Sniffs\Category\SomethingSniff, because the name is already in use` error.

I've not been able to reproduce the issues, but noticed that - at least in some of the cases - this involved external sniffs which extend other external sniffs and use a `use` statement for the parent sniff.

I suspect that the fact that I cannot reproduce this, may be due to sniffs not loading in a predefined order, but depending on when the directive to include the sniff/standard is encountered in the ruleset.

I imagine that if a child sniff is included first and a parent sniff second, this causes the fatal error.

Using `include_once` instead of `include` for typical class based files should solve this problem.

To that end, I've reviewed all uses of `include/require` in PHPCS and the three addressed in this PR are the result of that review."

This implements option 3 and 5 as discussed in 1910:
* Ignore comments which only consist of a silence operator + one alphanumeric word.
    This will prevent false positives on most (not all) ignore annotations from other tools.
* Ignore comments which result in only two or less non-whitespace tokens.
    This will prevent false positives on `// Ok!` type of comments.

    To implement this, I've elected to remove the open/close tags from the token array of the retokenized comment to prevent having to make the calculations more complicated.

Fixes 1910
Fixes 1912"

Both these sniffs extend the `AbstractVariableSniff`, so it makes sense to define the list as a property of that sniff and to re-use it in the individual sniffs instead.

Also changes the array format in a way that the more efficient `isset()` can be used instead of `in_array()`."

Looks like the property is no longer used in either of these sniffs or the parent sniffs they extend.

A quick look at the history reveals that the properties were introduced when the sniffs were written in 2007, but it looks like the use of the property was already removed a few days later (still in 2007) and that the property was never used in a released version.

Removing the properties does not seem to have any negative effects. The unit tests still pass without the property and the sniffs do not throw errors about an ""undefined property""."

When an inline comment is found at the end of a function, removing a blank line after it conflicts with the `Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionClosingBraceSpace` sniff which demands a blank line at the end of a function.

I have chosen to fix this by adding a specific error code for that situation and excluding that error code from the `Squiz` ruleset.

This way, the backward-compatibility break for other standards using the `Squiz.Commenting.InlineComment` sniff will be smallest.
Only if a standard explicitly in/excluded the `Squiz.Commenting.InlineComment.SpacingAfter` errorcode will this have any effect on them.

The unit tests already contain a test covering this. As the errorcode is excluded via the ruleset, the results of the unit tests do not change.

Fixes 1709"

Non-blocking reading from stdin was introduced in
80b156de8d440b6245e6b1dd7f8df777d99064fa because we had problems with
auto detecting whether we should read from stdin or not. Combining
`posix_isatty()`, `tty`, and, `feof()` can get us back to blocking read.

By going back to blocking read from stdin we can avoid the extra check
introduced in 23bd0235c5c4ebed5d5605844335c73530028e43 for Windows.

Error occurred when an unfinished function or OO structure is encountered.

While looking at the code, I saw three more minor improvements which I have included in this PR:
* Account for modern PHP OO structures.
    The sniff is designed to skip over declarations, but only accounted for functions, classes and interfaces.
    This has been updated to include closures, traits and anonymous classes.
* Add the semi-colon to the ignore list for reporting.
    In this context a 'lone' semi-colon is most often encountered at the end of a closure or anonymous class, so this might as well be skipped over.
* The sniff can thrown two or more errors on the same line when several ""exit"" commands have been found above the line.
    I've adjusted the error message to also report on the line where the ""exit"" command was encountered to make it easier to fix/debug these type of errors.

Includes unit tests.

Checks the spacing on the inside of arbitrary parentheses.

Arbitrary parentheses, for the purposes of this sniff, are all parentheses which do not belong to a control structure, function declaration, function call or language construct.
This is to prevent conflicts and duplication with rules for those type of constructs.

The sniff will throw (fixable) errors when an incorrect amount of whitespace (too much/too little) has been found on the inside or the parenthesis.
The sniff will throw a warning when an empty set of arbitrary parentheses is encountered.

Includes extensive unit tests.

Given this code:
```php
	 		wp_die( $api ); // Tab - Space - Tab - Tab
```
with tab width set to `4`, `wp_die()` would start in column 13.

The sniff was currently fixing this to:
```php
			 wp_die( $api ); // Tab - Tab - Tab - Space
```
which changed the start column to 14 and changed the ""space hidden before a tab"" to precision alignment.

This commit fixes that and is a further iteration building onto the improvements in 1404.

The above code will now be fixed as:
```php
			wp_die( $api ); // Tab - Tab - Tab
```

Notes:
* As the tabs in whitespace at the start of `T_INLINE_HTML` and `T_COMMENT` tokens is not replaced by spaces in the `content` by the tokenizer, this has to be done within the sniff to determine what the correct length of the whitespace should be.
* Basing the correction of the space-based length of the whitespace allows for fixing with higher precision.
* Incidentally, this also fixes one of the metrics being recorded incorrectly. For in-depth details of the effect on the metrics of this fix, please see: https://gist.github.com/jrfnl/5e2d75894c8e60a8f314b9fcb0ad3f62
* The `tabWidth` is now set in the unit test file."

The tokenizer tokenizes this code as:

In other words, the whitespace at the start of subsequent comment lines is tokenized as part of the `T_COMMENT`.

In effect, this meant that these lines would not throw the appropriate error, nor be fixed by this sniff.

While it is debatable whether it is a bug or a feature that custom property arrays are unforgiving about spaces surrounding the individual keys and values, all custom properties in PHPCS itself do not expect spaces around them.

This minor change removes spaces around array keys and values before the property is passed to the sniff.

This means that each of the below examples will now result in the same property value being set:
```xml
<rule ref=""Generic.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions"">
        <properties>
            <property name=""forbiddenFunctions"" value=""print=>echo,create_function=>null"" type=""array"" />

When a file uses tabs and a `tab-width` is set, the `content` will have spaces instead of tabs.
This could lead to situations where the output of `getTokensAsString()` when used to move content about would unintentionally replace tabs with spaces.

This small change allows for retrieving the original content by passing a third parameter.

I've chosen to add a parameter rather than change the default function behaviour to prevent breaks for existing sniffs relying on this behaviour, like the Squiz/ArrayDeclaration sniff: https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/blob/2ca6cf56420616cb47a88249eb5e3520f0e31ac7/src/Standards/Squiz/Sniffs/Arrays/ArrayDeclarationSniff.php#L477-L480"

I came across this issue when running `phpcbf` with the complete `WordPress` standard against the WPCS unit test files in an attempt to find fixer conflicts.

When an inline comment is the last non-whitespace content in a file, the sniff *will* report an error, but will always fail to fix it as the value of `$next` (formely on line 295) would be `false`.
The file would get the ""FAILED TO FIX"" status as there is still one ""fixable"" error remaining, even though the file is correctly overwritten by the fixed file.

As whether or not there should be a blank line at the end of a file is another matter and is covered by the `Generic.Files.EndFileNewline` / `Generic.Files.EndFileNoNewLine` sniffs, this specific case should IMHO not be handled by this sniff anyway.

The fix I'm proposing is to exit out of the sniff if the inline comment being examined is the last non-whitespace token in the file.

Includes unit tests demonstrating the issue."

The `File:isReference()` method misidentified a number of situations where the `T_BITWISE_AND` token was encountered, most notably:
* An array assignment of a calculated value with a bitwise and operator in it ,was being misidentified as a reference.
* A calculated default value for a function parameter with a bitwise and operator in it, was being misidentified as a reference.
* New by reference was not recognized as a reference.
* References to class properties with `self::`, `parent::`, `static::`, `namespace\Class::`, `classname::` were not recognized as references.

If any external standard or a custom ruleset refers to a complete standard and this standard is  registered in the `installed_paths` config as a one-standard directory, a `Reference sniff ...  does not exist` error will be thrown and no sniffs will be run.

Bug introduced in #1450 (by me, sorry!).

The reason for this is that the `getInstalledStandardPath()` method expects a string, but will  in actual fact receive a `SimpleXMLElement` object when a complete standard is included by  another standard. This was previously not documented in the function doc block as a possibility.

While in the original code, the `$standards` name was only used as a concatenated string - which  triggered the `SimpleXML.toString()` method -, the fix in #1450 introduced a strict comparison  without the `toString()` conversion, causing the bug.

Installed_paths | string `$standards` | SimpleXMLElement `$standards`
--------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------
""Standards"" directory | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:
one-standard directory | :white_check_mark: | :x: <= This is what this fixes.

While debugging this, I also noticed that this method is called for every single ref in the  ruleset and would go through the whole loop before returning `null`, while for `refs` which  refer to a custom xml ruleset or to a sniff or sniff category, `null` can be returned a lot  earlier and for paths which don't resolve to a ruleset, part of the loop can be skipped."

Since mid March this year, Travis uses PHPUnit 6.x for PHP 7+. The unit tests were not compatible with this and failing because of it unless another version of PHPUnit was installed.

These relatively minor changes fix that and makes the tests compatible with both PHPUnit < 6 as well as 6+.

Notes:
* I've elected to use the PHPUnit 6 class names as the basis to allow for eventually dropping PHPUnit 4.x support.
* I've moved some duplicate code which was used in the three test classes which are used as entry points to the boostrap.
* The Travis image for HHVM ships with an incompatible version of PHPUnit. This is circumvented by installing a lower version PHPUnit just and only for HHVM.

If a ""Standards"" directory is called the same as one of the standards it contains and that standard is requested an _""ERROR: the ... coding standard is not installed.""_ will be thrown and the sniffs will not run.

While I suppose this change in behaviour between PHPCS 3.x and PHPCS 2.x is intended to add support for ""one standard"" type of libraries, it breaks support for multi-standard libraries where one of the standards has the same name as the repository.

The change I'm proposing in this PR will maintain support for the PHPCS 2.x behaviour - thus not breaking existing registered standards - while at the same time supporting the new feature."

In the current setup, the tests were only run using the custom ini files.
This meant that the test-cases for which the default ini is expected, were never being run.

I've now added a custom environment variable which toggles whether the default ini values or the custom values should be used.

I've selectively chosen two PHP versions on which to do an extra test run with the custom ini file based on the sniffs involved.
The other PHP versions will now use the default ini values, making the build testing via travis more comprehensive.

For the two extra runs, only the unit tests are run. The other build tests are skipped as they are already covered by the build with the default ini values."

When the ini setting `short_open_tag` is `off` on the machine running PHPCS, short open tags would not be recognized in `T_INLINE_HTML` tokens.
This could lead to undesirable consequences if the code would later be deployed on a machine where `short_open_tag` is set to `on`.

This PR fixes that and will throw a warning if a use of short open tags is detected in inline HTML.

Note: the `getSnippet()` method is a 1-on-1 copy of the one used in the `DisallowAlternativePHPTags` sniff.
It would be better if that method would be placed in another file and just called by both sniff, but I wasn't sure which class would be most suited to place the method in."

Improve type hint recognition:
* `self` is a valid type hint and was so far not being recognized as such. Ref: http://php.net/functions.arguments#functions.arguments.type-declaration
* `parent` and `static` are *not* valid type hints, but if they are there, they were probably intended as such.
For both the above, made sure not to confuse the type hint with the default value.

New array value `raw`:
* Add raw content of the parameter parts to the return array for use in further processing.

Any function and method names starting with a double underscore are reserved by PHP itself for magic functions/methods.

A triple underscore function name prefix, however, should not trigger an error. (not saying it's a good idea, but it's out there in userland code)

Fixed in the two non-proprietary standards which have checks for double underscored function/method names.
Includes additional unit tests for all four sniffs.

This PR does not cover similar checks in the proprietary PEAR and Squiz standards."

If there are `installed_paths` set up in the config and one of the standards in the `installed_paths` uses an alternative way to unit test - this applies in particular to the PHPCompatibility sniff library -, running the unit tests for any of the other standards using the normal PHPCS unit test set up will fail as fatal errors will be thrown for (sniff) files which cannot be found.

The solution consists of two parts based on various iterations while trying to solve this.

Part 1 is checking an environment variable which can be passed in through the phpunit.xml file which allows for indicating one or more standards to ignore when setting up the test suite.
This is the simplest way to prevent the issue.
As there won't be that many people working on several standards which have their own test suite, for those few people to add the environment variable to their phpunit.xml file for the projects which do use the PHPCS native test suite, should not be much of a problem.

Part 2 is not necessary, but might be a nice to have (=result of an earlier iteration).
This involves the catching of the file path names of the files which are causing issues and reporting them back as part of the phpunit results in a neat list without errors being thrown before starting to run the unit tests."

This sniff checks  for the alternative PHP syntaxes - ASP tags and script tags - which have been removed in PHP7:
```php
<% echo 'content'; %>
<%= 'content'; %>
<script language=""php"">
echo 'content';
</script>
```
Ref: http://php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php

If PHPCS is run on PHP < 7, the script tags will be fixable, provided they are correct.
If PHPCS is run on PHP < 7 + asp_tags is on, the ASP tags will be fixable.

Fixes #1063

Similar to #1069, the `myconfig5.ini` and `myconfig57.ini` files and the adjustment to the travis script are needed for the fixer unit tests to pass as when asp_tags is set to off, the fixer won't fix it correctly and the tests will fail ;-)"

Inspired by: https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/pull/1084#discussion_r71835858

A PHP version number is build up as {major}.{minor}.{release}{extra}.
In 99.9% of cases where a version comparison is needed, the `{extra}` (`alpha/beta/RC`) information can/should be disregarded.
`PHP_VERSION` is a string which contains the complete version number, including `{extra}`.
`PHP_VERSION_ID` is an integer which contains the release version number *without* the `{extra}`

So using `PHP_VERSION_ID` allows to do accurate version comparisons without taking the `{extra}` into account *and* without an extra function call to `version_compare()`.

As `PHP_VERSION_ID` only became available in PHP 5.2.7, it needs to be defined in the application for older PHP versions.

The `$stackPtr` was being used instead of `$end`, leading to the
comment opener being replaced with `*/`. This would cause a syntax
error in the “fixed” PHP file.

The sniff did not have a test for the fixing component, which is why
this wasn’t caught sooner. I’ve added the `.fixed` file, but it is just
a copy of the `.inc` file, because I didn’t know for sure whether all
of the fixing behavior is correct. So currently the tests are
intentionally failing.

When checking a new set of code, if a cache file already exists in a common location, that cache file will be reused and added to instead of a new one being created.

The cache key is now generated by looking for loaded external and internal sniff files, then looking for all important core files, and hashing the result. Use -vv to see what files are being used for the hash, and other cache key values.

The cache key no longer includes severity or sniffs (removed previously) as files will record all errors and warnings during a cache run no matter what the filter settings are. Local files then replay the errors and warnings found with the filters on, removing the ones that should not be shown. Subsequent runs can then use the cache and reply the errors manually instead of tokenizing and checking the file. The result is that a filtered run will now cache everything needed for future unfiltered runs. It makes the first run a bit slower, but the cache much more useful.

To help with all this, error messages must now have codes. You can no longer leave them blank, which makes them impossible to override or filter in rulesets anyway."

If this suppression is used, only the following line will be suppressed, without the need for a closing *@codingStandardsIgnoreEnd* line.  This allows the suppression to occupy a little less space in the code, but was specifically implemented as a result of issue squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer#311.  Use of this suppression may also discourage large blocks of code being suppressed, or accidental suppression to the end of the file in the case where an *@codingStandardsIgnoreEnd* is misspelt or forgotten.

Commit includes updated unit tests.  The first attempt at this resulted in *@codingStandardsIgnoreLine* breaking any *@codingStandardsIgnoreStart*/*@codingStandardsIgnoreEnd* suppressions it was nested within, so there's a specific test for this case, too.

Alternative names for the suppression include *@codingStandardsIgnore* and *@codingStandardsIgnoreNext*."

My sniffs use 5.3 namespaces.

So when I use my coding standard, it gets registered, but PHP_CodeSniffer assumes underscores where I use a namespace.

Hence, my run fails with ""Cannot redeclare class 'Vendor\Sniffs\Something\FooSniff'"" later.

So the fix I introduced seems simple - without going reflection-crazy, I create a second variable which will do Vendor\Sniffs\Something\FooSniff along with the current default of Vendor_Sniffs_Something_FooSniff.

Then I test if the 5.3 variation was found (without triggering autoload) - if so, I override the name ($className) which is used to internally register it my Sniff.

Then all is good."

Currently the full, absolute path of a file is matched with the ignore
patterns, which makes it difficult to specify patterns to ignore
specific directories in a reusable way.

For example when running phpcs on a Drupal-based project located at
""/home/cyberwolf/myproject/"", you'd like to ignore the ""includes""
directory in the root of your project, because it contains Drupal core
code. However, other non-core directories can contain a directory
called ""includes"" as well, which you do not want to ignore while
scanning, for example
""/home/cyberwolf/myproject/sites/all/modules/foo/includes"". Currently,
to accomplish this, an ignore pattern with the absolute path needs to
be specified, for example ""/home/cyberwolf/myproject/includes"". This is
not reusable on other systems where the project might be checked out at
another path. Specifying ""includes"" would lead to phpcs also ignoring
""/home/cyberwolf/myproject/sites/all/modules/foo/includes"".

This patch makes the file path being matched with the ignore patterns
relative to the directory specified for scanning, so ""includes"" will be
used for matching instead of ""/home/cyberwolf/myproject/includes"",
""sites/all/modules/foo/includes"" will be used for matching instead of
""home/cyberwolf/myproject/sites/all/modules/foo/includes"", and so on.
Using ""^includes"" as an ignore pattern now will succesfully ignore
everything in the ""/home/cyberwolf/myproject/includes"" dir and nothing
else."

The list-style… lines were correctly merging their tokens in the CSS tokenizer post-processing but the tokenizer was not going through the curly braces and fixing up the open/close token IDs after removing a token from the array, so those values were invalid.

There is now also an additional check in the PHP tokenizer during post-processing to skip functions without openers. This happens when closures are used inside other function calls. The tokenizer still needs to find some way to parse the code in there, but that's going to be a bit tricky, so muting the notices is fine for now as behaviour doesn't change. Related bug report #19188 is still open for this additional parsing."

Using these sniffs dramatically increases the memory requirements of the scirpt as all the token arrays are left around in memory for later use. There may be an alternative way of doing this, but I also don't want to slow the multi-file sniffs down too much by re-parsing everything; but I may have to. I've also added a sample multi-file sniff and its new unit tests (a specific strucutre is required for these) that checks if the same class name is used multiple times throughout your files. Could be useful if you check your whole project, but mostly just a sample.

The idea here is to ensure that PHP_CodeSniffer always produces the same errors no matter what the EOL char is, unless a sniff is checking for it explicitly.
