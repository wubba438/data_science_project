Two changes here. First, we remove the sys.exit() calls inside the v3

directly via the subcommand, but causes the `./securedrop-admin install`
exit to quit before calling out to Ansible. We replace the sys.exit
calls with `return 0`, since the parent function expects an exit code
to be returned, and passes this to the shell.

Second, we stop calling the keygen logic automatically as part of the
install action. If anything, it'd be more appropriate to configure those
values as part of `sdconfig`, but since the generation depends on the
site config already being evaluted (i.e. v3_onion_services=True), we
shouldn't automatically generate keys before inspecting the config."

Resolves #4500
Resolves #4501
Resolves #4502
Resolves #4503

Additional tweaks chiefly agreed upon with Nina Alter (@ninavizz)
during pair development:

Global:
- Removal of some button icons that did not disambiguate meaning
- Tweaks to default button letter spacing, font weight
- Pick headline color that fits with new overall theme
- Ensure consistent use of headline levels
- Removed unused colors, styles, icons
- More careful spacing between icons and text on buttons
- Consistent use of upper case on large buttons

Source Interface:
- New trashcan icon for deleting replies
- Flipped order of introductory text on submit page by importance

Journalist Interface:
- Restyled timestamps, ""0 docs, 1 message"" type counters to be
  less easily confused with buttons
- Restyled ""Select all"" type buttons to not have checkbox icons
  on them, to ensure they're not confused with actual checkboxes
- Added spacing between Select buttons and other actions, to
  make logical distinction more obvious
- Removed download icon from each table row, as it did not convey
  sufficient meaning to justify keeping it
- Removed ""Reply"" icon from Reply headline, and left-aligned it,
  for consistency with other headlines
- Made textbox the same width as the table above it, and removed
  fixed column width, to ensure proper scaling across viewport
  sizes
- Right-aligned ""Submit"" button consistent with other forms
- Removed hover from ""X"" of modals, as it did not really add
  value here

Admin Interface:
- Made it more obvious when the Delete icon is disabled

Out of scope for this rev:
- String changes
- Typography changes
- Docs screenshot updates (will be done after final rev)"

Building on https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/pull/4555,
change the Debian packaging of securedrop-app-code to use
dh-virtualenv, allowing us to embed mod_wsgi in the package.

This means we don't have to include wheels and pip install them during
postinst. Not requiring python3-pip, which isn't available in the apt
repositories in /etc/apt/security.list, means upgrading to Python 3 is
going to be smoother.

The securedrop-app-code Debian package now Conflicts/Replaces
libapache2-mod-wsgi. It will be removed when this new package is
installed.

This requires updates to the builder Docker image, so I've made
changes under molecule/builder-xenial to support building the Debian
packages with a local image.

Noting for future removal: this includes a workaround for
https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/275 -- after upgrading
from Python 2 to Python 3, any existing session's csrf_token value
will be retrieved as bytes, causing a TypeError. This simple fix,
deleting the existing token, was suggested in the issue comments. This
code will be safe to remove after Python 2 reaches EOL in 2020, and no
supported SecureDrop installations can still have this problem."

Merge Makefile and securedrop/Makefile. I've left securedrop/Makefile

their equivalents in the top-level Makefile.

Type linting no longer requires a dedicated virtualenv once we're on
Python 3, so mypy is now part of the normal development requirements.

Switch mypy checking from 2.7 to Python 3.5.

Our Python dependencies also required updates, starting with Molecule,
which didn't support Python 3.5 until 2.20.1, so would have required
us to run a more recent Python 3 for development than we deploy under.

The pip-tools package needed to be updated to work with pip 19.1.1,

Adds rendering rule for the icon to accomplish two things:
- give the icon room to breathe
- force crisp rendering, to render large source image cleanly
  at smaller size (the source PNG is a bit larger than the
  default size to accommodate zooming)

The crisp rendering rule may make sense as a generic rule at a
later point, but so far this seems to be the best candidate
for using it.

The new icon was designed by Nina Alter (@ninavizz) and is not
derived from FontAwesome, hence not in the font-awesome directory.

Add methods to more reliably send key events to elements. This seems
to have fixed one of the most pernicious flaky tests,
test_journalist_interface_ui_with_modal, allowing removal of the
hideous retry hack that could make the tests take minutes longer.

Use them to replace other usages of send_keys, including some that
have definitely been flaky, though not as bad as that one.

Also simplify the safe_click* methods, as WebDriverWait.until returns
the result of the wait condition, and some of the other element
manipulations were unnecessary, given the expected conditions.

Stop setting a default implicit wait in the web drivers. If an element
might not be present, we should use explicit waits instead of adding
this potential delay to every element-locating call. There's also
ample Selenium folklore that mixing implicit and explicit waits leads
to unpredictable timeouts and possible bad behavior.

Rename _alert_wait and _alert_accept.

Double the timeout in alert_wait. This helped with some timeouts
waiting for confirmation popups."

First, it's a good idea to run `make clean` prior to building the boxes,
because the logic to push to S3 will push all artifacts present in the

packages, and in fact that could have unintended side-effects.

Second, for point releases, the previous version of an upgrade box will
not be present in the release branch, so conflicts can occur.

CircleCI's branch filtering does not work properly with pull requests
from forks. The CIRCLE_BRANCH variable contains something like /pull/3
in this case. This means that docs and i18n PRs from forks are not
being tested as we wish; the translation tests are not run for i18n
PRs, and the app tests are being run for docs PRs.

A CircleCI feature request [1] to improve this was closed without
explanation, so I'm incorporating a workaround suggested in the
CircleCI forums: using the GitHub API to obtain the real branch name
for PRs from forks, and skipping tests if it doesn't match. Not all
steps of the relevant jobs are skipped, but the most expensive ones
are.

Also, stop skipping static-analysis-and-no-known-cves, as it doesn't
take that long, and might prevent problems from sneaking in on
branches with inaccurate names.

Previous logic when sessions expire on /generate:
1. On /generate page, codename is added to the session.
2. When expiration occurs, session is cleared.
3. A flashed message indicating that the session has expired
would be added to the current session (this is done via passing
`_flashes` on the session object [0]).
4. Execution enters the view function associated with `/create`.
But `/create` expects codename to be in the session (which was
cleared in step 2), thus a KeyError will occur.

Logic now when sessions expire on /generate:
1. On /generate page, codename is added to the session
2. When expiration occurs, session is cleared and user is redirected to the index.

Use of six.u was corrupting translator names. According to
https://pythonhosted.org/six/index.html#six.u -- ""On Python 2, u()
doesn't know what the encoding of the literal is. Each byte is
converted directly to the unicode codepoint of the same value. Because
of this, it's only safe to use u() with strings of ASCII data.""

Of course some translators' names were not just ASCII, so I've
replaced usage of six.u with u"""", as it should be safe on both Python
2 and Python 3 > 3.3, per PEP-0414.

I also changed the commit format to put each contributor's name on its
own line, and tried to clarify the source of the translations. It was
confusing to me, at least, that translations were being ""copied from""
a revision that involved a different language.

Finally, we were gathering the list of contributors from commits other
than just the Weblate contributions, so whoever last ran the tool was
getting credited for translations since. I've changed the tool to only
look for contributors in the automated Weblate commits."

In tests/functional/functional_test.py, FunctionalTest.setup mocked
things up, and if an exception were thrown after that in setup, the
mocks weren't getting cleaned up. Subsequent two-factor tests were
then failing because models.Journalist.verify_token would always
return true. This replaces setup/teardown with pytest fixtures and
ensures that the mocks are stopped.

Also retry web driver creation to work around intermittent Marionette
problems.

We had redundant session timeout tests, so I removed one.

In a couple of places we were changing models.LOGIN_HARDENING and not
resetting it to the original value, so those have been fixed.

Also, because we just set the servers' names to ""localhost"" in the
tests, Flask was warning that it wasn't a valid cookie domain. So I've
appended "".localdomain"" to shut it up. We have enough noise in our
test output.

In test_alembic, the whitespace pattern '\s*' could be empty,
potentially causing trouble for split(). Make it r'\s+'.

Patch get_entropy_estimate in tests/test_integration.py and
tests/test_source.py to prevent failures when CI machines run low on
entropy. In test_source.py, the call to logger.assert_called_once_with
in test_failed_normalize_timestamps_logs_warning fails if entropy is
low in CI -- it's failing not because the message is repeated, but
because the mock is called more than once, when the submit route logs
that it can't generate the source's key."

Now installs Firefox 52 ESR, rather than Firefox 46, for use inside the
test container.

Includes changes to run-test shell script:

    TOR_FORCE_NET_CONFIG=0 is required to directly connect to Tor
    network, otherwise it will wait for userinput to either connect
    or to configure

    The `run_xvfb` invocation is no longer necessary, since the test suite
    code bootstraps the headless server now.

Creates local test server inside the container

Bootstrapping the application services within the functional test suite.
Includes some cleanup, culling unused debugging code, and also cleans up
the various print statements.

Ignore functional test firefox logs (thanks, @msheiny!)

Adds retries for tor network connection failure, using the pre-existing
logic.

Uses nc rather than torsocks in functional tests

The version of torsocks in the Trusty repos isn't recent enough to
support custom ports. Rather than install from other sources, which
requires manual package verification (or configuring non-trusty repos,
which could break other packages), let's fall back to good ol' nc.

Creates proper orbot specific project to test

We need to create a new firefox profile to test the orbot specific
warning. This works for both locally and over Tor.

Updates test_make_account_changes for Tor

Now we can safely execute the account changes in the tests running
on the Tor browser. The logic update makes sure to create different
user for this test than any other test.

Reduces sleep durations in functional tests

We don't have to sleep for too long if we are running against
local instance. The ultimate goal remains to remove hardcoded sleeps
altogether, but we'll circle back and eliminate those calls once the
test suite is passing reliably.

Increases CircleCI timeout to 20m

The functional tests can take a long time, so let's instruct CircleCI to
continue waiting, to give the test suite a chance to finish
successfully.

Updates README for the functional tests

Mostly correcting a typo in the `instance_information.json` config
filename, but also updated some of the example commands. The notes
regarding potentially failing tests also seemed out of date, as several
members of the team have confirmed working functional tests under the
new TB Selenium logic recently.

Removes temporary testing related directories

We need to clean up any temporary test directory before running
any test, as the previous can create a bad state in the database.
For example, one of our pages-layout test adds 123456 as hotp value
to the test account, and it will never be able to login again.

Adds missing steps for pages-layout tests over tor

We can now generate thousands of random journalist names using
the generator. Only the first 3 names are used in the functional
tests, the rest are being used in the pages-layout.

We also added back _source_delete_key function for one the test.
Rest of the updates are to add sleep function calls or to have
better error message.

Adds comment about the user generator and lint fixes

We have get_journalist_usernames generator which can generate
unlimited number of users for many tests.

Moves around all driver creation functions into one place

We now have the functional/functional_test.py to handle all
driver creation logic. For the pages-layout tests, we are creating
only a Firefox driver to connect to the local container itself.

This logic does not work against any external server as of now.

Updates test user creation logic inside of container

Removing old method calls from user creation logic, this is only
used inside of the container for the functional testing.

Downloads data from server using requests over Tor

The test requirements now have requests[socks] as dependency.
Using the same we are now directly downloading the files/messages
from the .onion address for functional tests.

The old external command file also got removed this committ.

We are creating the gpg object for both container based local
testing and external testing (in functional tests).
Fixes: #3691 #3687

Removed xvfb, tor browser, and firefox installs from app-staging - functional tests now run remotely

fix to pass make ci-lint

Cleans up flake8 errors in functional tests

Resolves some lingering flake8 formatting violations that were causing
lint checks to fail. These changes are unrelated to the current PR, but
better late than never.

Written by @msheiny, committed by @conorsch during branch collab.

Signed-off-by: Conor Schaefer <conor@freedom.press>

Adds --staging flag create-dev-data.py for tests

We now have --staging flag to the create-dev-data.py script so
that we can easily create an user in the staging or prodcution test
and then use the functional tests to test the instance.

Add fact gatherer for extracting tor app onion details

This is really for functional testing in staging environments, but the
script doesnt hurt to be installed in prod. It doesn't elevate
permissions or expose any sensitive details - you need to run as root in
order to gain useful data.

Logic to dump app tor onion data to func config

This commit adds logic to the test runner so that a functional test json
config gets dumped for usage in the tbb selenium test tools against
staging.

Wire-up current app-test role to our upgrade scenario

Without this change, the upgrade scenario would utilize the app-test
logic from the old repo. Which is not what we want. This is of course
kind of ""hacky"". I welcome the opportunity to improve this with feedback
:)

Move tor fact logic from tor role --> app-test role

I'm not sure we are ready to shove this on prod instances AND I was
running into weird old/new role logic under the molecule scenario.
Ideally the fact should be in both roles but I dunno.. this seemed like
an easier short-term fix.

ansible spacing' and tag nits

Testinfra: Update test dependencies for app-staging

In #3697, we removed the application testing pip dependencies.
This commit updates the testinfra test variables accordingly.

Fix linting failures

One of these was introduced in #3672, but not discovered due to
other CI failures (e.g. python not found when running the lint job)

Use absolute pathing in i18n testing

I'm hoping this shakes out some really weird test failures we were
seeing only under CircleCI only under the functional testing branch at a
certain point in time. Really wild behavior. *fingers crossed*

Set selenium webdriver test output to WARNING

Originally was on DEBUG and was sending out mountains of output into the
pytest process which made it difficult to assess anything.

(cherry picked from commit a1f013408721aa4f87bb3fb8439e9f21d7e2adfc)

removed duplicate entry in test requirements

Dockerfile: Update Tor Browser to 8.0

Docker development environment: Update Tor signing key

Dockerfile: Update geckodriver and firefox-esr

Swap x11vnc with tightvncserver

Basically installed this because it can be used with pyvirtualdisplay as
a backend AND because it brings in the Xvnc tooling which will start an
X11 server as well as a VNC server.

Wire-up VNC server and helper command for func tests

Had to remove x11 display logic inside test scaffolding (initially tried
to integrate it there but it kept building and destroying the VNC server
per test).

Made a VNC helper command with support for GNOME desktop and macOS (havent
tested it on mac yet). Updated the docs

Bump functional test sleep time

10 seconds is way too short.. 160 seconds.. maybe too long? Fingers
crossed I can work with the team to get the wait_for logic running

Add functionality to prepare boxes for functional testing

Typically these actions were done manually but lets get our good old
friend ansible to run them for us (at least under the upgrade env).

Added auth to VNC in test container, for OS X compatibility.

Bump TBB/ESR to 8.0.1 and 60.2.0esr combo

https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-801

Updated geckodriver to 0.22.0

added ini file to get around remote-viewer password prompt

Functional tests: xfail test_warning_appears_if_tor_browser_not_in_use

Due to defect #3793, when using Firefox Quantum, the incorrect message
is displayed on the source interface. This test will not pass until that
is resolved.

Functional tests: Fix firefox path

Testinfra: Fix test failure due to non-DRY variables files

staging.yml is a concatenation of multiple other variables files,
one was updated during rebase, one was not.

Testinfra: Update Flask version to 1.0.2

fixed VNC port being defined twice when running 'make dev'

Tests: Modify viewport size for parity between dev and CI env

In CI we are getting MoveTargetOutOfBoundsException, but not locally.
We have had errors in the past due to different viewport sizes in CI
and locally, so setting this to a standard size for the pages layout
tests (where the exception is occurring).

Functional tests: Resolve NoAlertPresentException

We were getting a NoAlertPresentException due to new behavior in
geckodriver [0] where interacting with the driver closes the modal.
Thus, we do not need to explicitly accept the modal here.

[0] https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/1171

Replaced parameterized time.sleep()s with self.waitfor()s

Stability fixes layout tests, added new functests from develop, updated TBB

fixed flaky page layout tests that were broken by long fr_FR strings causing UI elements to wrap.

fixed flake8, added explicit scroll to elements before click, stability fixes

Dockerfile: get key from Mozilla keyserver

For whatever reason, this Firefox signing key was not available on
the keyserver in the prior diff, but was available on Mozilla's
keyserver.

deps: Update requests due to CVE-2018-18074

functional tests: Add wait_for prior to clicking submit

functional tests: Remove sleeps and reduce flakiness around modal

functional tests: Remove sleeps around js alerts

functional tests: use sleep_time as default timeout

functional tests: Remove remainder of time.sleeps in source steps

term.

I chose to use the shorter ""Submission Key"" instead of
""SecureDrop Submission Key"" since other terms like
*Journalist Workstation* are also SecureDrop-specific, and the
convention to italicize such terms makes it reasonably clear
that they carry a context-specific meaning.

To ensure asynchronous processes like submission deletion and hashing
happen in dev containers, run supervisord and our rq worker.

This adds a ""run_supervisor"" function in dev-deps that creates a
supervisor config under /tmp (which just runs the rq worker), and
starts supervisor.

That function is now invoked in securedrop/bin/run.

The Dockerfiles now install supervisor via pip or pip3.

""Look at these logs"" is one of the most common support responses,
so having canonical and correct information in the public docs
is important and  reduces the risk of small errors in these
communications.

I moved the `securedrop-admin logs` instructions into an include
file, since it is a common operation we will likely want to refer
to again in future, and renamed the section to ""Investigating
Logs"", since it is now hopefully beginning to be deserving of

Encountered reliable timeouts on privilege escalation prompts after the
VMs had been instructed to reboot, on the gather_facts step prior to
shutting the VMs down for packaging. Tried the following, in order:

  1. Reused the reboot-and-wait logic from the site config.
  2. Bumping the gather_timeout value (as we do in the debian package build
     logic scenarios).
  3. Added mandatory pause of 30s post-reboot.
  4. Added mandatory pause of 60s post-reboot.

When the final change was added, the problem was reliably resolved. It's
possible we can drop the gather_timeout bump, but given the wall time
involved in testing, I'm deferring further improvements to a later date.

If you're reading this message, consider that ControlPersist files may
be relevant to the timeouts. I haven't confirmed that assumption, but
it's possible that the long pause post-reboot has the side-effect of
allowing the active ControlPersist files on the controller to expire,
forcing a new connection.

This commit only DRYs up the xenial docker layer caching steps
because the trusty job will soon be going away (and because I
only want to use the xenial docker layer cache for the translation
job).

Due to an incomplete implementation of YAML anchors on CircleCI [0, 1],
this commit adds one anchor per step.

As evidenced by the test failures we've discovered, we'll need
to make some changes that ideally work under both Trusty and Xenial.
This means that we need to run the application tests in both
environments. This PR adds a $BASE_OS env var that can be either
""trusty"" or ""xenial"". It uses this env var for docker builds, and modifies
the docker build logic to point to a Dockerfile outside of the build
context [1]. We make a new directory in the securedrop/ directory
called Dockerfiles that contains the Dockerfiles for both
environments.

By default, the other Makefile targets will use
Trusty. Once trusty is EOL, we can delete the Trusty
Dockerfile, though it would be prudent to leave the BASE_OS
logic in place for the next major OS transition.

We missed updating the upgrade boxes during post-release procedure for both
0.10.0 and 0.11.0. Since 0.11.0 is still the most current release, it was
rather straightforward to prepare a box. Catching up with 0.10.0 was trickier,
however, since the box preparation logic assumes that whatever version
is posted to the prod apt repo is the correct one to prepare for; no longer
the case. As such, I'm omitting metadata for the 0.10.0 version.

Since I did prepare and upload those boxes before realizing the 0.10/0.11 version
discrepancy, here are the checksums of what's stored in S3:

Under Trusty, apt calls run as the root user. Under Xenial, however, apt
calls run as the `_apt` user. We must ensure that the firewall rules
permit apt updates on both systems, before and after the upgrade from
Trusty to Xenial. We cannot add references to `_apt` under Trusty, since
the user doesn't exist in the passwd file, causing the iptables-restore
action to fail.

Let's simply remove the uid-owner restriction on the apt-specific
iptables rule. By this point in the iptables logic, non-whitelisted traffic
from both the `debian-tor` and `www-data` users hsa been dropped (via
jump to the LOGNDROP chain). As such, it's fine to loosen the
specificity of the iptables rules somewhat, in order to ensure a smooth
transition."

There were a number of big changes here that took a lot of tweaking in
concert so it was best to collect them in the same commit.

To break it down:
* Now we are installing shellcheck so we dont have to use a separate
  container
* Swapped to a smaller python container (that we negate with filling
  with a bunch of apt packages)
* Removed COPY of entire workspace, rely on volume mounting instead.
  With that have to also do the weird docker create user to match UID
  dance
* Only rebuild the container when three files change - dockerfile,
  requiresments.txt, and Makefile. These make it so you have to
  rebuild the linting container MUCH less often. Makes it way easier
  for us to have caching on the CirleCI end."

Two part reason for doing this:
* logic in Makefile was getting too large .. its better to manage this
type of stuff in a dedicated script

* I had to make significant changes as part of the `match CI lint to dev

One thing you might note is that I dropped use of perl for sed+awk. Why
did I do this? I saw some weird behavior with the perl logic locally -
while I was debugging and I realized as soon as I changed it that I
uncovered a bunch of failing tests.

I also wanted to drop the weird call docker from inside docker logic we

At some point in molecule dev, the ephemeral directory was moved from
the local scenario dir + `.molecule` to a path in
/tmp/molecule/${git_dir}/${scenario_dir} . This is a welcome change
EXCEPT that there could be an edge case where someone clones in
securedrop without the default `securedrop` dir path. This is
problematic because the molecule.yml will not take dynamic interpolation
AND its the only spot i could figure out to specify the ansible roles
dir.

So I wanted to take advantage of the new location of the ephermeral
directory while also having a hard-coded roles_dir that wont change. The
work around here is moving the git clone to the official molecule
ephemeral dir, but using the legacy spot to make a roles symlink. There
is some DRY improvements that can obviously be made but since this is
already a crazy commit I tried to hold my self back from more
refactoring."

The NTP-related checks were implemented to help Admins debug common
install-time misconfigurations of DNS servers (which would break package
fetching via apt). We've since moved the kernel install tasks to precede
the ntp checks, so they're not really serving their purpose.

On Trusty, ntp and ntpdate are present in the default configuration, and
therefore available for use. The same is not true of Xenial, however, so
let's first ensure that ntp and ntpdate are installed before referencing
them in commands. This is a bit of a catch-22, since any DNS failures
would cause the install tasks to fail. Still, though, it's worth
checking since these verification tasks may uncover errors related
strictly to NTP but not to DNS."

Using a multiplier of 100 in this script adds over 5000 sources to
the database, each with many submissions and replies. At the scale
that SecureDrop is currently at, e.g. without pagination on the
journalist interface, it is highly unlikely any organization has this
many sources saved. Even if they had a submission saved from every
day for the last several years, they'd still have less than 5000.

The large number of sources can also increase the chance that there
are timeouts on the journalist interface, due to the lack of pagination.

As such, we should make this more realistic, e.g. a multiplier of 25,
which adds 1250 sources to the database."

Accordingly, removes occurrences of the SECUREDROP_TESTINFRA_TARGET_HOST

In the AWS staging Molecule scenario, we've already implemented custom

well, given that the relative-path import logic for the reboot task list

the task logic to a full role resolves import errors when running the

As a downside of the move from Vagrant to Molecule, we'll lose the
ability to detect automatically a suitable provider for the Vagrant

VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=libvirt to override the virtualbox default used
by Vagrant.

The major benefit of the Molecule transition is that it opens up testing
against multiple *platforms*, e.g. Trusty and Xenial, in the near
future. Ideally we can also cut the wrapper logic in
`testinfra/test.py`, since Molecule integrated with Testinfra just fine

which fails for two reasons:

* The unique constraint on filesystem_id is not at the same line in
  the CREATE TABLE statement.
* The table name is quoted in one CREATE TABLE statement, but not
  in the other.

In order to make our tests a little more lenient in this case (and
not produce spurious test failures), we should:

* Compare sorted lists consisting of the lines in each CREATE
  TABLE statement

We recently (#3617) modified the CI rebase logic to accommodate more
than just the develop branch. That's good! However, the new logic
assumed that the env var `CIRCLE_PULL_REQUEST` would be defined. Turns
out it's only defined on PRs, which makes sense, but not during CI runs
against a base branch such as ""develop"".

Modified the rebase script to execute the main block if-and-only-if
`CIRCLE_PULL_REQUEST` is set. Additionally, sprinkled in some more error
checking bash settings at the top of the file, to make future debugging
sessions more straightforward (`set -u` in particular makes mistakes
like this quite clear).

Closes #3639."

This commit makes several changes to error handling on
the journalist interface.

First, CSRF protection is not necessary for a REST API that is not
using cookies for authentication, which this one is not (we
pass a token in a HTTP header). We exempt only the api blueprint
views from CSRF protection, and leave it as is for the remainder
of the journalist application.

Second, we use blueprint-level handlers so that we can more easily
present the relevant response to the user: an informative JSON
error response (i.e. one that contains details of why the request
was not valid) or an HTML page that is rendered in the style of
the rest of the journalist application.

Note that blueprint level 404 and 405 error handlers are not respected,
so we add logic to use the API's error handlers to return nice
error messages to the user."

Additionally runs `git clean -f -x`, which will purge all gitignored
files from the directory. Anything prod-related, such as a pubkey for
OSSEC email alerts, or the *site-specific vars file* will be removed.

Admins should never run this command, since it will destroy
site-specific info. The project documentation instructs Admins to use
the `securedrop-admin` script, and the `Makefile` is only for
developers. Therefore it seems safe to include a destructive action like
this, given that it is not included in Admin-facing documentation.

my hypothesis is that this is occuring when we are assigned a keyserver
that is IPv6 from the pool [2]. For test purposes, I'm setting a
reliable default keyserver in gpg.conf.

Previous commit made sure that ansible always connects via the
hard-coded IP. Unfortunately we cant always tell vagrant to do this
because when vagrant first boots a machine it needs to SSH in to set a

then force the `vagrant ssh` command to utilize the static IP. Win-win

not just make a custom Dockerfile is that making a custom Dockerfile
seemed like overkill for installing a single apt dependency.

SSH directly, this commit expands that:
    * by disabling the Tor SSH service when direct ssh is enabled

      port for ssh traffic. of course if someone decides to allow direct
      SSH over a public facing interface with globally addressable IP
      space thats problematic -- but unfortunately some of these design

We require the well-known stanza in the source

example if an admin installed SecureDrop a year ago,
then the user will get a 404 when navigating to the
validation file. If this is the case, then they should
run securedrop-admin install such that the latest
Apache configs are copied over to the servers and
Apache is restarted.

We should not instruct admins to run
securedrop-admin install ""just in case"" as this will
result in a 20 minute+ install run (and they have to
do it again when they get the cert) which should
be avoided if unnecessary."

Linting

build: pip wheel must fail when it does not build a python module

build: re-create the builder docker image when Dockerfile changes

It takes longer but works all the time. Uploading an image to a docker
repository to speed-up the build requires an additional manual step
and access to the docker repository.

A possible optimization (would be a few minutes faster) could be
implemented by storing docker layers, similar to what is done for the
Dockerfile used when testing.

Our use of cron-apt includes autoclean and autoremove flags. Unless we
declare an explicit dependency on the 3.14.79 kernel image package, it
may be cleaned up. That's ultimately desirable, but would prevent orgs
that have trouble with the new kernel from falling back to a known-good
kernel. Let's preserve the old image as a fallback for now.

In subsequent releases, we can omit the dependency on 3.x, and simply
require a single kernel version, as we've done in the past. For now 0.6,
let's provide rollback capability, since we cannot test on all hardware."

In 0.5.2 and beyond, we use the version string 0.x.y~rcN for the Nth
release candidate for 0.x.y. This versioning scheme is correct, in
that Debian and Ubuntu recognize 0.x.y as a higher version than
0.x.y~rcN.

The primary concern is for the ""securedrop-prod.yml"" playbook, which is
what Admins use to configure a production SecureDrop instance. In that
playbook, any error encountered during provisioning should cause an
immediate failure, aborting execution and reporting an error message for
review.

If the max_fail_percentage is *not* set to 0, debugging errors becomes
challenging, often involving lots of scrollback to piece together what
specifically went wrong.

In order to provide a sane strategy for testing adherence to this
requirement, we'll test all playbooks (defined as ""YAML file in
ansible-base directory, and not the old prod-specific.yml vars file"")
and ensure the option is set on each and every play. That's a bit
aggressive, but the tests are extremely fast, and will likely pay off
as we bring new contributors into the project who may not be familiar
with this rather esoteric Ansible option."

Reuses @msheiny's `iptables` Ansible module implementation, which is
remarkably clean. Love the state=absent functionality.

Rather than use `delegate_to`, we target both hosts and use the boolean
vars `ossec_is_server` and `ossec_is_client` (both defaulting to False)
in order to determine which host the task should execute on. For some
tasks, we want both hosts to execute, thus the combined play target.

Uses a rather gnarly hostvars-based retrieval to map a registered var
result across both hosts, ensuring the same value is accessible to both
play hosts, to coordinate the firewall rule management. Left an in-line
comment to guide future maintainers.

The buttons on the generate page on the source interface have long
text in a few languages. We should have them gracefully go to two
lines if needed, with space between them and they should be right
aligned.

The space is done via a new class `btn--space` (following BEM [0])
which specifies a 10px margin so that this renders nicely.

Then `pull-right` is applied to each button individually so the
buttons (not just the div) individually are right aligned (in RTL
languages they will be left-aligned).

Using the ""mapped"" filesystem sharing strategy via libvirt requires
careful permissions management on the host machine. By default, any
volumes mounted as ""mapped"" into a libvirt VM will be read-only, unless
the libvirt-qemu user has write access to the directory.

Let's create a Makefile target that will aid Linux developers in
configuring the necessary permissions via extended attributes. The
approach with `setfacl` is taken from [0]. The `-user` option is
intended to avoid attempts to manipulate permissions on files the
user does not own; this will happen to any files created within
the libvirt VM, since those are always created as `libvirt-qemu` (or
whatever user the daemon runs as).

SC2001 [0] refers to use of sed for munging variables in Bash. The rule only triggers
on our update_version script, which admittedly is pretty difficult to read when
it comes to swapping out the periods within the version numbers (since
the periods are treated as special characters by sed).

SC2064 [1] refers to use of bash traps, and is violated only once in our
project, in the securedrop-keyring package preinst script. The usage
there works either way, so we could place an in-line ignore within the
file, but I figured that would only complicate review. Once we have
linting in place, we can continually revise to get up to par.

SC2181 [2] refers to exist code checking via `$?`, rather than in-line. This
is low priority, since it's stylistic more than functional, and besides
some of the files that showed violations here are slated for removal
(specifically the bash scripts for CI, which are being ported to
 Molecule).

SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify

The recently added pre-commit hook sources a file, but within a
conditional statement, since not all developers will store their
virtualenv in the same location. Shellcheck isn't smart enough to parse
the conditional, so just ignore the implied source path.

If we use the shellcheck directive to point to the path, and it doesn't
exist, shellcheck will still fail, since it can't read in the file
at the designated source path. The shellcheck wiki recommends the
/dev/null approach in such scenarios.

prevents recursing into the `.venv/` directory, which is where the
securedrop-admin script sets up a virtualenv for install Python
dependencies via pip for Admin Workstation tooling. We don't want to
fail on errors inside that directory, because we don't maintain the
source files in there.

Furthermore, the mapped mounting strategy I use for Tails VMs via

Since moving to the new Ubuntu Trusty image in Travis, Firefox 46.0.1 is

The nslookup command provides more robust options for configuring

Using `nslookup` to force retries makes the validation logic more
durable, because it occasionally fails early due to flaky networking in
Tails over Tor. While we could use the `retries/until` Ansible pragma
to repeat the checks with the `host` command, we cannot adjust the
timeout on the host command, so retrying would take about 10 minutes
on a single task before failure is reported.

More importantly, we need the definedness checks in separate tasks so

Somewhat lazily conflating ""state"" and ""enabled"" parameters in Ansible,
which map to whether the service a) is running and b) will run on next

The `backup` role was using `async` for the creation of the backup
tarball, but failed to wait on the results of that task before
proceeding. Since the subsequent tasks operate on the backup tarball,
the role failed due to an undefined variable, specifically the
`backup_filename` var.

The solution is to preserve the async nature of the task, since it can
indeed take a while to complete, but make sure to poll for results,
and pause execution of the role until the backup has completed.

Since SSH connections in SecureDrop are routed over Authenticated Tor
Hidden Services (ATHS), restarts of the tor daemon will sever existing
SSH connections, thereby breaking Ansible playbook runs if a handler to
restart tor is notified. Although we take care to ensure that tor
service restart action completes successfully (#1707), the subsequent
reconnection by Ansible is affected by SSH ControlPersist files.

When tor is restarted, the SSH connection is never formally severed,
so SSH reasonably believes that the ControlPersist files on the Admin
Workstation represent still-active connections to the remote machines.
Once tor is restarted, this is no longer true. The solution is to clear
out any existing ControlPersist files whenever tor is restarted.
Subsequent Ansible tasks will then be forced to open a new
ControlMaster, and fresh ControlPersist files will be automatically
created, and the play will continue as normal.

Fixes #1969."

-q omits progress indicators, which generally look messy when reprinted.
Note that -q must come *before* the command (e.g. install).

Using -q alone does not solve the problem because apt-get calls out to
dpkg, which gets confused about whether it is printing to a
terminal or not, attempts to use carriage returns to display

html.parser isn't as lenient as html5lib, the HTML parser that
BeautifulSoup was using by default before we started explicitly
specifying html.parser. Switching to a less-lenient parser exposed two
tests that were relying on lenient parsing to succeed:
TestIntegration.test_reply_normal and
TestIntegration.test_unicode_reply_with_ansi_env.

Printing the BeautifulSoup parse tree in the failing tests showed that
it was interpreting `input[name=reply_filename]` as a *child* of
`input[name=csrf_token]`, when it should be a sibling. This was due to
the invalid trailing slash on the `input[name=csrf_token]`. Since the
BeautifulSoup CSS selector was specifically looking for a child (not any
descendant), this unintentional extra layer of nesting caused the
selector, and thus the test, to fail.

This commit also does some minor cleanup of invalid HTML5 in the same
area of code. All tests are now passing with html.parser."

Converts the `envsetup` function, which handles:

  3. Installing Python packages via pip

apt and pip installations. The virtualenv creation is still left in the

Also improves exception handling for both new functions. For apt:

During Tails boot, apt packages are sometimes installed automatically,
which results in an apt lock that prohibits interactive apt commands
until those background tasks complete. Mostly the automatic installation
will occur if the Admin configured apt package persistence, which was
configured automatically in SecureDrop 0.3.12 under Tails 2.x, but *not*
in SecureDrop 0.4 under Tails 3.x, since we're switching to a virtualenv

Thanks to the prior commit's more careful checking of the order of
operations called on a SecureTemporaryFile,
`test_submit_sanitizes_filename` started failing because `gzip.GzipFile`
was being mocked and not actually called. This meant that a
SecureTemporaryFile was created in `save_file_submission` (starting in
the `init` state), but it was never written to (transitioning to the
`write` state) in the unit tests because of the mocked `GzipFile`. Thus,
when `crypto_util.encrypt` tried to `read` from the SecureTemporaryFile,
it failed because it was still in the `init` state, and the improved
checking caught the violation of the intended contract as documented in
SecureTemporaryFile's docstring.

One easy way to fix this is to transform the `GzipFile` mock into a spy
using `wraps`. This allow us to inspect the arguments passed to
`GzipFile`, as needed for our test assertions, but still calls the
underlying `GzipFile` implementation, which fulfills the expected
contract for SecureTemporaryFile and fixes the broken test."

membership strategy. Leverages group_vars to skip apache configuration,
same as on the development host. Conditionally skips dist-upgrade on
Travis, since the build host didn't like that one bit when I switched to
the development playbook (rather than continue to use a travis-specific
playbook).

Sprinkles a few more `pip freeze -l` commands around to provide more
debugging info, since I always add those lines in a fork when trying to
debug Travis. Now they run by default, every time. This is necessary
since we don't have proper isolation between the various pip
environments (e.g. Ansible controller versus development machine) in
Travis."

The `validate` role previously ran in two different contexts:

  1. In the configure playbook, for validating input.
  2. In the prod playbook, for validating stored vars.

In 1, the target host is localhost running Tails, the Admin Workstation.
In 2, the target host is remote, running Ubuntu, the SecureDrop servers.
Validation of the `ansible_user` var is only relevant to the latter
case, since that value will always be ""amnesia"" when running against
localhost. So let's only expect it *not* to be amnesia if we're trying
to connect to the Ansible hosts.

It's safer to do the vars validation prior to connecting to any servers,
since the connection will fail if the SSH user value is wrong. To
provide informative error messaging if the `-u <username>` flag is
omitted, we should consider setting `remote_user` at the play level; but

The original intent with the 'validate' role was to ensure that
production SecureDrop instances do not use common values for required
variables, such as SSH username. The motiviation was to harden the
instance by forcing an attacker to steal secrets before they can
interact with the instance in a meaningful way, much how blacklisting
""root"" as a valid SSH username is considered a best practice.

In practice, however, the non-standard SSH username (since Tails always
runs as the ""amnesia"" user, Admins cannot use their regular custom
username) causes problems, and requires that Admins pass in the SSH
username on every command-line invocation of the playbook. We can do
better than that, and pass in the site-specific username in the

Since the staging environment installs the locally-built deb packages on

because it's difficult to detect whether the code changed, so it's
better to be safe than sorry), and also performs an apt upgrade every
time, we need to be sure we don't inadvertently switch to the production
packages in the FPF apt repo on upgrade. Thus we mark the locally built
packages as ""held"", prohibiting upgrades.

While it's not terribly difficult to ascertain whether the ""hold"" action
resulted in a change, we're constantly wiping ""hold"" state by forcing
package installation via `dpkg -i <deb>`. Therefore we should check
whether the packages are marked as held prior to installation, and use
that state to compare the changed status."

Two motivations for this change:

  1. The sudo=no means that iptables rules post-initial-provisioning

     but the real solution is to create a new client host for running

  2. Targeting /tmp means that the deb package was redownloaded after

`--limit` argument as specified in the Vagrantfile from ""all"" to

the issue was Vagrant-specific.

Also removed a trailing newline on the message itself, simply to clean
it up a bit, since the default output includes a literal '\n'.

If we restart the tor service during a playbook run that's connected
over Tor, the playbook will immediately fail. Any changes to the torrc
will notify the ""restart tor"" handler, and currently the *only* time
that won't break is during the very first playbook run, at install time.

Let's make the handler notification smarter, and if we're connected over
Tor, we'll bounce the service async (via fire-and-forget), then wait 90
seconds until trying to connect again. Normally we could use
local_action/wait_for to wait _up to_ 300 seconds or so, and continue
execution if the port opens within a smaller time interval, e.g. 90
seconds; but unfortunately the wait_for module is not smart enough to
build the socket query based on extra connection info such as is
required for routing the connection over Tor. Therefore we're stuck with
a hardcoded wait time."

A common Ansible gotcha is that file modes in multiline YAML format must
be quoted, so that they are interpreted as strings, to be passed to
`chmod`. If raw integers are provided instead, Ansible (due to Python
underneath) will interpret them as octal values and the permissions
won't map correctly, so the target host will receive (likely) broken
permissions.

To avoid such ambiguity, let's make sure that all occurances of file
mode declarations in Ansible are quoted. In the interested of
consistency, we'll use double quotes, although single quotes would have
the same effect.

Since the unquoted modes updated here already started with a leading
zero, the modes are as expected. Technically the first bit (e.g. setuid,
setgid, etc.) could have been altered, but it's sane for us to set 0 on
all these files, which are mostly config files."

This is purely a stylistic change for the sake of consistency and
readability; it does *not* affect how Ansible processes the file modes,
so the permissions on the remote host are not altered by these changes.
If the single quotes had not been present and the double quotes were
added, that can alter the permissions intepretation, but we've been
careful about that type of regression by explicitly declaring modes in
the config test suite."

Previously under the Staging environment, we made the AppArmor config

In practice, this permissive policy permitted mistakes to slip in,
mostly through lack of updates to the AppArmor policy. Developers can
already rapidly prototype on the application code in the `development`

AppArmor profiles, to provide a more realistic imitation of a real

The use of Flask-Assets via #1180 for minifying static assets requires the

AppArmor rules permit writing inside of these directories already (those

exist, since the `mkdir` logic will fail, since the parent directory is
not writable in the AppArmor profile.

So the deb package should include the empty directories, but since the
server itself will handle minification, we should not ship any
pre-minified static assets; so let's add a config test to ensure that
doesn't happen. The config tests check for the existence of the

  * 956b2137255a39fb7091a82b669af6537ba0548d # unique logic removed

Building the deb packages locally and installing directly revealed some
permissions disparity between what's set up via Ansible versus what's

declared in the postinst scripts, e.g. `chmod -R 550 <dir>`, which
unnecessarily marks files as executable.

In practice, the permissions set by Ansible will be overridden by the
postinst scripts during the next upgrade, which means there's a window
between the first installed version and the first upgraded version where
the permissions are not set correctly. We should consider folding the OSSEC

When a source is already logged in, clicking the back button could log
them out and generate a new codename. This could cause the source to lose
their original codename if it was not memorized yet. This commit will
redirect the source to the look page if they accidentally go back to the
generate page when logged in. It also adds an explicit logout button when
the source is logged in. This adds both confidence and professionalism to
the appearance."

Since the IPv4 addresses for the staging and prod hosts are hardcoded in

VirtualBox creates is called ""intnet"", so the IP reuse will cause
failure for the App and Mon servers communicating with each other for
OSSEC functionality.

The most likely use case for multiple concurrent VM instances is in
conjunction with `git worktree`, which will create a new working copy of
an existing local git repository. It's a bit of an assumption that the
two worktrees will have a unique basenames (e.g. ""securedrop"" and
""securedrop2""), but a reasonable one—more reasonable than using the
absolute path to the repo, which is certain to be unique, but extremely
verbose.

The default forwarded ports remain the same, as documented in the
developer docs. This change allows Vagrant to reassign the forwarded
port on the host machine if a collision is detected. Vagrant will
display an informative message if this happens:

  ==> app-staging: Checking if box 'bento/ubuntu-14.04' is up to date...
  ==> app-staging: Fixed port collision for 80 => 8082. Now on port 2204.
  ==> app-staging: Fixed port collision for 8080 => 8083. Now on port 2205.
  ==> app-staging: Fixed port collision for 22 => 2222. Now on port 2206.
  ==> app-staging: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
  ==> app-staging: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
      app-staging: Adapter 1: nat
      app-staging: Adapter 2: intnet
  ==> app-staging: Forwarding ports...
      app-staging: 80 (guest) => 2204 (host) (adapter 1)
      app-staging: 8080 (guest) => 2205 (host) (adapter 1)
      app-staging: 22 (guest) => 2206 (host) (adapter 1)

There are two plausible use cases where a collision can occur:

  1. Running VMs elsewhere on host, for other projects, use same port
     for forwarding a web interface. 8080 in particular is commonly used
     by many projects.

  2. Running separate git worktree for the SecureDrop project, to test
     multiple feature branches concurrently. Since a full VM provision
     run can take around 20 minutes, working concurrently on different
     trees can greatly enhance developer productivity.

The second use case is run I run into frequently while working on
SecureDrop."

In production installs of SecureDrop, the local IPv4 addresses must be
hard-coded by the Admins in the vars files. These addresses are used
to connect to the hosts during the initial Ansible run, after which SSH
access is restricted to Authenticated Tor Hidden Service (ATHS) for SSH.
The IPv4 addresses are also used for OSSEC monitoring over the LAN,
behind the hardware firewall.

In the staging environment, we have the benefit of inferring the
internal IPv4 addresses in testing environments, since developers
control the machine creation. Although it's possible to hardcode IP
addresses for the Vagrant VMs, and use these hardcoded values in the
staging vars, the same approach would not work for testing in
environments other than Vagrant/VirtualBox, such as DigitalOcean.

The previous approach naively used the Ansible host fact
`.ansible_all_ipv4_addresses.0`, which is *usually* correct, but not
guaranteed to be, since the list var of all IPv4 addresses is not
ordered. Therefore let's specify the interface we expect the IPv4
address to be associated with, and explicitly retrieve the address based
on the interface name. This allows for selective overrides in different
environments, e.g. VirtualBox vs. DigitalOcean. Production vars are
unaffected by this change."

After merging 0.3.9 into develop, we found that the
test_submit_and_retrieve_message functional test was broken. The
breakage was intermittent but frequent, and manifested as failure to
find target elements by class name or CSS selector in a target page.
When we inspected the source of the target page during a failing test,
we found that it instead contained the XML source for a Firefox
""Connection Interrupted"" error page instead of the expected HTML from
the SecureDrop Source Interface web application. We also noticed that
this tended to occur in conjunction with a ""Broken Pipe"" traceback from
the Source Interface server started by the functional test runner.

This breakage was unexpected because the full test suite is passing on
both the develop branch and on the 0.3.9 tag.

Our current theory is that this error was caused by Selenium making
multiple concurrent requests to the Werkzeug toy web server, which does
not handle concurrent requests well. For our purposes, it seems
sufficient to tell Werkzeug to run the test web server with
`threaded=True` so it can better handle concurrent requests, as
suggested by this Stack Overflow poster:
http://stackoverflow.com/a/12591943.

We are not sure why merging 0.3.9 would have caused this behavior to
change, but theorize that it could be due to recent changes in Firefox,
which has been updated recently, or due to recent changes in Selenium or
Flask, which were both updated as part of 0.3.9."

The only merge conflicts were in the `securedrop/requirements/*.txt`
files, because:

1. Dependency version numbers were updated in 0.3.9, while
2. Dependencies were added/removed in develop.

Since the `securedrop/requirements/*.in` files merged successfully, we
resolved these merge conflicts simply by re-running `pip_update.sh`."

For this release's QA testing, I cut a release candidate with the
version ""0.3.7+rc1"". According to Debian's version numbering rules, this
is > ""0.3.7"", and dch prevents me from updating the changelog with a
version number that is technically later than the latest one already in
there.

0.3.7+rc1 was never pushed to production servers, so this is not going
to cause a problem in production. Testers who may have installed
0.3.7+rc1 will not automatically upgrade to 0.3.7, but that's only FPF
staff so it shouldn't matter.

In the future, we should use a versioning scheme that is compatible with
Debian's - I did not realize this was so complex. For now, I am
disabling the strict version checking in dch so I can get this release

* Silences zenity output during script run

If the script needs to prompt for config information interactively,
`zenity` is called to display a dialog box and accept text input.
When called, zenity will print noisy output to STDERR:

  GtkDialog mapped without a transient parent. This is discouraged.
  ** (zenity:28513): WARNING **: atk-bridge: Couldn't listen on dbus
                     server: Failed to bind socket
                     ""/root/.cache/at-spi2-socket-28513"": No such file or
                     directory

Given that the install.sh script is designed to be run interactively in
a terminal, we should hide that expected error output so it doesn't
clutter up the otherwise informative output of the script. This has been
done by redirecting STDERR to /dev/null. Note that only STDERR is
redirected, since STDOUT must operate normally in order for the captured
text to percolate up to the function caller and be used in the script.

* Removes verbose logging messages from install.sh

Partially reverts 69a7dacfd5158f8e4cc838254610d9d718e0c360. Since that's
a squashed commit, it's actually
8c63352f0327f9513cd4de8d133dc486594e2762 that's been reverted.

The `echo` statements were implemented during review and were
inadequately tested. The goal was to provide Admins with visibility into
where the script was referencing the A/THS URL information, since it
checks multiple locations. Unfortunately the `echo` statements caused
improper interpolation, and were also improperly called several times,
generating redundant output.

So let's remove the ""Found here:"" echo statements. Preserving the
echo calls that state that interactive prompting was necessary, although
those calls are now redirecting to STDERR."

* Updates git command from 'pull' -> 'fetch'

As of 0.3.7 we're requiring Tails v2.x. Tails v2, based on Debian
Jessie, ships with git v2, which changes the default strategy for pulls.
Hopefully most Admins will be proficient enough with git to navigate
the pull/fetch discrepancy, but let's err on the side of caution and
make the documentation as explicit as possible.

Using `git fetch` is terser and more legible than `git pull origin
release/0.3.7`, dig?

* Mentions 3 USB port requirement in Tails upgrade docs

The docs assume that the SVS/airgapped machine has 3 USB ports available
for simultaneous use. All 3 USB devices must be plugged in together:

  * master Tails USB (running the OS)
  * target USB for upgrade
  * Backup Device (for storing persistence files)

Technically an Admin with only 2 USB ports available could use the
ephemeral storage on the Admin Workstation as a go-between for the
backup process, but that would require even more convoluted language in
the documentation."

The problem: currently the only ReadTheDocs documentation available is
built from the develop branch, which is under active development. While
the installation and usage instructions are currently accurate for
0.3.x, they have already begun to diverge as develop moves toward 0.4,
and will only continue to diverge. ReadTheDocs has nice automatic
support for building ""stable"" documentation based on the latest tag
(according to semver semantics).

By copying the current ReadTheDocs documentation from develop into
0.3.7, we ensure that when 0.3.7 is released, we will have two sets of

on the docs that this commit backports from develop), and a ""latest"" set

The THS and ATHS config files fetched back to localhost should be
formatted with a trailing newline to support concatentation in the torrc

missing newlines will make it difficult to copy/paste correctly.)

Unfortunately Ansible v1 and v2 handle trailing newlines differently, so
the safest method to ensure reliable behavior across versions is to use
a template, and omit the hardcoded newline altogether. This approach
works on both v1 and v2."

The main change in this commit is that the commands to fetch keys now give the
fingerprints in a paranthesis-enclosed, spaced-groups-of-four format. This
format should work long-term with Tails because it is not expected to switch to
GPGv2 for years. In GPGv2 this formatting does not work, but we can (and should)
file an issue upstream, so this doesn't turn into a bug in 3 years.

This change was made because it allows users to fetch keys in the safest way
possible (i.e., by passing the full fingerprint to GPG) in a way where if they
are manually typing in the argument they are the least likely to make a mistake.

Of course, instructions surrounding these commands have been changed to make
this more clear.

Also, a couple mistakes/ issues pointed out in
https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/pull/1212 have been fixed.

This commit does the following:

* Adds a warning to contact us in case the checksum of the Ubuntu ISO image is

* Fixes the unsafe key import command in the OSSEC guide. It had been missed
  somehow even though I searched through the document.

Since Tails already provides a guide to verifying their images, and we do not
wish to explain how to do so ourselves (as a goal is to keep this install guide
as short and simple as possible), it makes sense to remove their fingerprint. It
does not make sense to have it here without accompanying instructions.

Reading and confirming you have typed a fingerprint correctly is much easier
when it is broken into sections. Therefore I have done so and added emphasis
that it's important you check it is correct before proceeding to download the
corresponding key.

Previously we used

headers to ensure that assets being served were not cached at all by the

evidence on the source machine indicating that they've used securedrop.

TorBrowser patches Firefox such that it does not persist cached assets
to disk, and keeps them solely in RAM.

Neither TorBrowser, nor our use of cache-control headers can prevent the
OS from swapping to disk, in which case all cached assets are persisted
to disk leaking information.

The size of the assets being served in securedrop is in the order of
tens of kilobytes now that we're minimizing them. It is highly unlikely
that these assets will be the straw to break the camels back memory
wise causing a swap to disk.

Without the caching headers the experience of loading securedrop is
disjointed, as the stylesheets load well after the page has begun
rendering. The experience of loading securedrop is *greatly* improved by
allowing short-term caching of these assets."

* Removal of redundant verification of key fingerprint (since GPG now does it
  implicitly).
* Admin is now explicitly instructed to download and verify Ubuntu Server over
  Tor, for greater privacy and security (see comments on 1157 for details).
* SKS hidden keyserver is now used instead of non-HKPS SKS pool for greater
  privacy and security (see comments on 1157 for details).
* Improved exposition on key fingerprints in admin-oriented documentation, w/o
  being over-technical or introducing concepts not elsewhere mentioned.
* Lastly, since a modification to the documentation on creating an Ubuntu
  installation medium was already in place, I went ahead and gave a recommended
  usage of the dd command.

Major changes:

  * more verbose hostgroup names
  * uses consolidated roles
  * updates `manage-groups` role

Inclusion of the `prod-specific.yml` prod vars file is still
hardcoded on every play, since moving the prod vars into
group_vars would require Admin intervention. The prod playbook
now uses the shared roles for app and mon servers, e.g. ""common""
rather than ""common-app"" and ""common-mon"", where appropriate.

Calling the groups ""app"" and ""mon"" creates a namespace
collision for the prod host aliases, which are also
""app"" and ""mon"". Instead, let's call the groups:

  securedrop_application_server
  securedrop_monitor_server

Then we can add the hosts to those groups, regardless
of whether the host is ""app"", ""app-staging"", or ""app-prod"".
Also entirely eliminates confusion throughout the Ansible config.

Typically Ansible hostgroups are managed in inventory,
whether static or dynamic. Currently, SecureDrop admins
are given a template static inventory file which they
edit with instance-specific information such as IP addresses.
Changing that static inventory file would create a merge conflict,
so instead we'll use a custom role that only applies to prod
hosts to manage the group membership. This way, group_vars
can be used for the App and Mon servers, without breakage.

For similar reasons, the `prod-specific.yml` vars file
is left adjacent to the playbooks, rather than moved to
`group_vars/prod` or similar."

added a lot of todos (using ReST's handy todo admonition) throughout as
I identified issues that should be fixed in the future, but are too much

and there are a lot of todos, I'm making them visible in the final
output of the doc builder. This will draw developer and user attention
to the outstanding todos, which I hope will encourage developers to work
on them and help users understand some of the shortcomings they might
find as they use our documentation.

Once the docs are more stable and we've resolved all or most of these

polished."

This commit has a ton of changes, so you probably just want to review
the end product instead of the diff. The way that I did this was to
start going through the installation documentation from beginning (the
overview stuff) to end (onboarding journalists), splitting,
reorganizing, and revising the installation documentation as I went.

I think the finished product is a good basis for future work on the
installation documentation; I do not think it is worth it to go back and
try to split this into smaller, more focused commits.

One of the key structural changes in this documentation is that I took
Tom Lowenthal's advice of splitting the install docs into two sequential
sections: ""base install with just an admin user"" and ""onboarding
journalists after the base install is done"". I think it is a great
improvement, and helps keep the documentation focused while also
aligning nicely with the way installs are usually done."

In order to take advantage of Read the Docs' handy TOC sidebar and the
""previous/next"" buttons on each page, we need to split the documentation
into smaller chunks. This is a first take at doing so, primarily
focused on splitting up the mammoth Install Guide (`install.rst`) into
numerous smaller documents. The specific sections do not flow well right
now, and are occasionally repetitive, so further work needs to be done
here.

This commit also (because I was navigating all over the docs and trying
to reshape them, and am now too lazy to split this into multiple focused
commits):

- Renames the ""Roles"" document to ""Passphrases"", because that's all it
  talks about right now. In the future, we may want to move some of the
  material from the Overview and/or Terminology guides into Passphrases,
  which would make it worthy of the ""Roles"" title.
- Adds a dedicated TOC for upgrade documentation, since it was already
  nested deeply and that trend will only continue as we release more
  versions.
- Converts various sections into admonitions, according to the vagaries
  of my judgement.
- Fixes less-than-ideal things from the Markdown -> ReST conversion,
  spelling issues, and various other nits."

On second thought, instead of migrating the developer docs to a Github
wiki, we should keep them in the main documentation as long as they do
not hamper the use of the docs for end users. I added a new TOC for the
developer docs at the bottom of the index so the developer docs are
readily available for developers but are not in the way of end users.

This commit deletes some developer docs that Conor and I determined are
obsolete:

- docs/creating_deb.rst
- docs/snap_ci.rst

I've been noticing a weird bug in the TOC for the locally rendered docs
using the RTD Sphinx theme. For example, if you click ""Upgrading
SecureDrop"" under the ""Install SecureDrop"" TOC in the sidebar, the
entire ""Developer Documentation"" TOC disappears from the sidebar when
you're on the ""Upgrading SecureDrop"" page. I am interested to see if
this bug persists when I push the docs to Github and rebuild them from RTD."

In the initial migration from markdown to ReST/Sphinx/RTD, the index
page just had a single TOC with every documentation file in one big
list. Now that we have Sphinx/RTD, we can take advantage of all of its
features to organize and interlink the docs in order to make them more
discoverable.

This outline is my first stab at doing this. I explain in an
introduction that this documentation is meant for end users
only (sources, journalists, and administrators), while developer
documentation will be maintained on the Github project wiki. I haven't
moved the ""developer"" docs to the Github wiki yet, but plan to do so in
future commits.

Once I'd established a focus on end user documentation, I decided to
split the index into two main sections:

1. A series of guides for each type of end user (Source, Journalist,
Administrator)

2. A big outline of all the documentation for the installation process

I also added placeholders for future documentation on troubleshooting
and a pre-installation overview."

by hand and haven't had time to test to see if importing it works. I
think it's better for an admin to configure the network firewall by hand
with the WebGUI so they can understand how to troubleshoot it, so I'm
not too worried that this can't be imported (for now). It is mostly
included to be a canonical, textual representation of the recommended
network firewall rules."

I reworded the section encouraging the use of the pfSense guide and

Since we can no longer rely on the availability of the pfSense Guide

the pfSense Guide in the Network Firewall guide. I removed all
references to the pfSense guide, which was not as much of a loss as I
was initially afraid it would be:

* We had to remove the reference to the section on Assigning
  Interfaces. You only need to assign interfaces if you built your own
  network firewall and installed pfSense from scratch - they come
  pre-assigned on the appliances that we recommend for most
  users. Therefore I think it's ok to simply remove this section.
* Removed a reference to section 4.5.6, which explained the rationale
  for using a self-signed certificate on the WebGUI. While interesting,
  it was not necessary to successfully use this guide.
* Section 6 in the pfSense guide was a helpful walkthrough of setting up
  firewall rules with the WebGUI. I considered this to be the most
  important reference to the pfSense Guide, but I think we can live
  without it for now. From recent installation experience, people seem
  to do okay setting up the firewall rules by imitating the example
  screenshots without reading this part of the guide. We may want to add
  our own documentation to explain this process if it proves to be
  challenging for admins in future installs."

Reimplements support for the `fingerprint` security level
for Postfix config. Specifying a fingerprint to validate the
SMTP relay causes problems if the fingerprint changes, e.g.
due to load balancing or scheduled rotation.

Therefore the default TLS security level is now `secure`,
which mandates TLS, but trusts system CAs, rather than
requiring a fingeprint. Admins can also provide a custom
cert in case the system CAs won't validate or aren't trusted.

removes smtp_relay_fingerprint from vars files

Since the fingerprint is no longer required, remove it from the
top-level vars files. All required vars in `prod-specific.yml`
require declaration, so leaving this var empty would be
confusing for new admins.

Removing the var from `prod-specific.yml` will require admin
intervention to prevent a merge conflict on upgrade. Specifically,
the admin should:

  1. delete the fingerprint line from `prod-specific.yml`
  2. stash save local changes
  3. pull update
  4. pop saved stash

If the admin wants to retain fingerprint checking, leaving the
fingerprint declared in `prod-specific.yml` will honor that decision.
It may result in a merge conflict on pull, however, which should
be resolved manually.

formatting changes for readability

adds documentation of `fingerprint` security level

The Postfix config defaults to `secure`, which should work
well out of the box for common configs. In case admins want to
restrict verification to a specific fingerprint (the previous
default behavior for the SecureDrop's OSSEC Postfix config),
these docs provide steps for how to do so.

Mostly reverts 153d17c, which removed the commands for querying
the fingerprint.

There was only one occurrence of ""support@freedom.press"" in the
entire repo, and this was it. Fixed to match the 13 other occurrences

Also checked for any other @freedom.press emails in `docs`,

In previous versions of the AppArmor profile for Apache,
the apache2 process was permitted to send SIGTERM to unconfined peers,
a permission which allowed apache2 to terminate a previously running,
unconfined instance of itself, then take its place with the
AppArmor profile enforced.

Since the signal permission was removed from the AppArmor profile,
the apache2 process now fails to restart during the installation of the
`securedrop-app-code` package, although only on systems without grsecurity.
While production instances should all have grsecurity running,
many test instances do not, particularly cloud nodes used for running
automated test suites."

adds conditional logic for CApath vs. CAfile

The postfix docs provide two vars for controlling
certificate verification during TLS connections:

 * [smtp_tls_CApath](http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_CApath)
 * [smtp_tls_CAfile](http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_CAfile)

By default, `smtp_tls_CApath` should be declared, pointing to
`/etc/ssl/certs`. If an admin provides a specific cert to use,
then declare `smtp_tls_CAfile` instead, pointing at the file.

adds separate playbook for managing custom certs

Provides decent encapsulation of conditional logic,
so playbooks remain readable. Overrides should happen
above role default vars, e.g. in role vars or host vars.

This is a corollary to the previous commit. While it was not mentioned
in the iSec report, it follows that if we apply a mitigation to the
journalist login to prevent DoS via submitting excessively long
passwords, we should do the same for the Source Interface - which, if
anything, is *more* vulnerable because it is publicly available as a
normal hidden service, not an authenticated hidden service like the
Document Interface.

The MAX_CODENAME_LEN is arbitrary, but is already far longer than the
longest possible codename given the current wordlist and maximum
codename length (10 words). I have tested to confirm that 128-character
codenames cannot trigger DoS.

I also modified the source logging to not print out the codename when
`valid_codename` returns False. In the context of this issue, this is
useful because an attacker who is sending enormously long codenames as a
DoS attempt would have those codenames printed to the log file, which
would make it extremely dificult to work with the logs. In general, this
is defense in depth - while logging for the Source Interface is disabled
in production, if it were turned on temporarily or accidentally, it
would be good to avoid logging all invalid codenames, as I would expect
that many of them would be *very* close to actual source's codenames
(except for one or two typos).

Adds a unit test to make sure `hash_codename` is not called if the
codename is over the maximum length, which prevents the DoS.

Corollary to resolving iSEC-15FTC-6."

Defines the maximum password length for a Journalist to be 128
characters and enforces this limit during Journalist creation
(`__init__`) and login (`login`). Enforcing this limit during login
avoids potentially computing scrypt for excessively long passwords,
which would be a DoS vector.

Tests:

* Logging in with an excessively long password should raise an
  `InvalidPasswordLength` exception.
* Logging in with a valid password length should call
  `Journalist._scrypt_hash`.
* Logging in with an invalid password length should *not* call
  `Journalist._scrypt_hash` (to make sure the DoS is prevented).

This is a hack to fix a specific issue that we encountered during
testing. The sequence of events is as such:

1. Run the upgrade playbook.
2. You potentially encounter #1008, which causes the playbook run to
fail after a reboot and leaves the upgrade in an unfinished state.

Ideally, you would be able to simply re-run the playbook to try the
upgrade again (and hopefully complete it). However, this is not possible
because:

1. The upgrade playbook removed the old SecureDrop .deb packages.
2. Due to #911, ""logo.png"" was included in the 0.3pre
securedrop-app-code .deb package, and so was removed when the packages
were removed.
3. Re-running `0.3pre_upgrade.py` fails when it tries to back up
`logo.png` in `backup_app`.

Since the custom logo.png file is also present on the Admin Workstation,
Ansible will place that file and therefore does not really need the copy
on the application server. Therefore, we can safely ignore this file if
it is not present. This should allow the script to conclude successfully
even if the upgrade had previously terminated early due to #1008."

Due to a race condition with the original, `.xsessionrc`-based approach
for auto-configuring Tor to use the SecureDrop authenticated Tor Hidden
Services, upgrading to 0.3.3 and re-running `tails_files/install.sh`
often caused Tor to break. This was confusing and meant that a restart
was required for an admin to restore a functioning Tor. For a full
explanation, see #1015.

This commit ""repairs"" the torrc backup used by `securedrop_init` if the
race condition occurred. This is a stopgap and only happens once, in the
session where we remove the broken .xsesssionrc while upgrading from
0.3.2 to 0.3.3's tails_files. We can safely remove this code after all
SecureDrop's are running SecureDrop >= 0.3.3.

This commit also checks if `.xsessionrc` is present before deleting
it. Previously, it would just delete the file and continue whether or
not there was an error (which there would be if the file was not
present). This works, but is poor shell scripting practice (not
""defensive coding""). Ideally `tails_files/install.sh` would have `set
-e` at the top to prevent it from continuing if an error occurs, but
that will have to be a long-term project due to the lack of error
handling throughout the rest of the script."

This commit replaces `./manage.py {start,stop,restart}` with a single
command, `./manage.py run`. This command runs *both* of the interfaces
with Flask development servers, which provide useful debugging and
auto-reloading features. The logging output from both interfaces is
aggregated into a single stream, labeled for clarity, and sent to stdout
for the developer to read.

The `run` command carefully handles the case where a change to a
monitored file cannot be interpreted (e.g. if it introduces a
SyntaxError), which causes the auto-reloader to exit. This case would
break `./manage.py start` because one of the processes it had spawned
had died behind its back. This made it difficult (especially for new
developers) to understand and recover from a somewhat common error
condition. `run` does not break when this happens, but prints out a
clear message and exits both servers to avoid confusion.

Updates development documentation to recommend using `run`, and removes
references to the removed `{start,stop,restart}` commands."

Sometimes when the Ansible upgrade role is run, the upgrade script
completes successfully, but then something goes wrong later in the
role. For example, network connectivity issues may cause one of the
later package upgrades to fail. In this situation, we need to be able to
re-run the playbook. This means the `0.3pre_upgrade.py` script needs to
be idempotent.

The script performs a full SecureDrop backup to `/tmp` before continuing
on both the app and monitor servers. Since it would be complex to verify
whether the backups were idempotent, we simply make a backup every time
the script is run. The backup filenames are timestamped, so there is no
concern about accidentally overwriting them. Since the files are stored
in `/tmp`, they will automatically be cleaned up after the next reboot.

On the app server, the upgrade script also migrates the app database. To
make this idempotent, we check for the last change made as part of the
database migration. If that change is present, we take it as evidence
that the database has already been migrated and skip the migration. This
makes the database migration idempotent.

This commit also does some formatting cleanup, adds docstrings, and
encapsulates getting the database connection into a function to make the
script more DRY."

This regression was caused by the PEP8 fixes in cd6f4c3, which among
other things changed instances of `x == False` to `x is False`. While
this would not cause a functional change in normal Python, it does cause
a functional change in the context of SQLAlchemy's `filter*`
methods. These methods override `==` but do not appear to override `is`,
so replacing `==` with `is` breaks the query.

I have grep'ed the code and checked the diff of the breaking commit to
make sure this commit fixes all instances of this error.

Fixes #969"

This document refers to ""your specific .onion address"" as

signals that start of an italicized block. This can cause problems
depending on the Markdown renderer - for example, the document renders
to HTML fine when viewed on Github, but when this document is displayed
in a Github PR, all document text following that `*` is italicized,
which is confusing and not the intent.

The easy fix is to fence `*.onion` with backticks so it's treated as
preformatted text/code."

When you do a migration, you're starting with an existing system with a
known version; therefore, it makes more sense to group migration scripts
by the version they are migrating *from* rather than the version they
are migration *to*. This is also better because it is conceivable for
multiple base versions (e.g. 0.2.1 *and* 0.3pre) to need migration
support to a single version (e.g. 0.3).

This creates a consistent naming scheme for all of the directories in
`migration_scripts`, because 0.3pre was already the set of scripts used
to migration 0.3pre installations to 0.3."

This regression was caused by the PEP8 fixes in cd6f4c3, which among
other things changed instances of `x == False` to `x is False`. While
this would not cause a functional change in normal Python, it does cause
a functional change in the context of SQLAlchemy's `filter*`
methods. These methods override `==` but do not appear to override `is`,
so replacing `==` with `is` breaks the query.

I have grep'ed the code and checked the diff of the breaking commit to
make sure this commit fixes all instances of this error.

Access to the admin_add_user view should be restricted to administrators
only. Unfortunately, I accidentally omitted the `@admin_required`
decorator for this view. Since `@admin_required` encapsulates
`@login_required`, this means that anybody with access to the Document
Interface would be able to create a user accounts.

This is a fix for the issue reported on Bugtraq:

This document refers to ""your specific .onion address"" as
`*.onion`. Unfortunately, `*` is a reserved Markdown character that
signals that start of an italicized block. This can cause problems
depending on the Markdown renderer - for example, the document renders
to HTML fine when viewed on Github, but when this document is displayed
in a Github PR, all document text following that `*` is italicized,
which is confusing and not the intent.

The easy fix is to fence `*.onion` with backticks so it's treated as
preformatted text/code."

Previously, the Source Interface and the Document Interface both used
the same CSS file (`/static/i/styles.css`). This sometimes created
problems where changing styles on one interface would cause problems with
the styles on another.

I've also updated the links in the HTML templates for each interface to
use the correct CSS file, depending on the interface.

In the future, we should work to clean up and simplify these CSS files.

ever used on the Document Interface, nor vice versa."

Since the changes in f9969001 simplified and reduced the number of steps
in the submission deletion flow, it exposed a previously hidden problem
with deleting replies. Submissions and replies are both securely deleted
with `srm` to reduce the possibility of forensic recovery. `srm` is run
asynchronously via a job queue, since it can take a long time to run
(especially for large files).

Since Submissions were recorded in the database, we used that to
determine if they had been deleted. The files might still be on the
disk, but they would be in the job queue either being deleted or waiting
to be deleted. Replies never had a database table, so we previously
tested for whether they'd been deleted by checking for their presence on
the filesystem. This assumption is rendered invalid by the async job
queue, and the problem was made readily visible by the reduced wasted
time in the new and improved deletion UX flow. Now it is possible for a
user to select multiple documents and delete them, only to see the
replies still in the list upon being automatically redirected to the
collection page. Waiting and then refreshing will cause the replies to
disappear, showing that they had been scheduled for deletion but had not
yet been deleted when the collection list was refreshed.

The best solution to this problem was to add a similar table for Replies
to the database. This has the benefit of simplifying a lot of code,
which previously handled replies and submissions differently and can now
handle it identically or at least similarly. It may also be beneficial
in the future, as it is now easier to attach metadata to replies and
build more sophisticated data relations between them and other entities
in the system."

Since submission deletion is a destructive action, we want to confirm it before
carrying it out. The original flow was cumbersome and required three
separate steps for each set of documents deleted:

1. Click delete
2. Confirm that the files you selected are the ones you want to delete
   on `delete.html`
3. See a confirmation on a separate page (!!) with a link that, when
   clicked, takes you back to the collection you started with.

This commit adds a new Javascript-based flow that uses a pop-up alert to
confirm deletion. The original flow, which did not use any
Javascript, has been left in in case the journalist's browser has JS
disabled, and has been improved by replace the 3rd step in the list
above with a redirect back to the original collection accompanied by a
flashed notification.

24h was chosen arbitrarily, and may need to be tuned in the future based

Previously, when a journalist submitted a reply to a source on the
Document Interface, they would see a confirmation page that:

1. Confirmed that the reply had been stored
2. Explained that the reply:
   1. would show up in the list of documents
   2. might eventually be deleted by the source, which could be
      indicative that it was read (although that is a bit fuzzy).

The journalist then had to click the ""Return to the list of documents
for foobar..."" link to return to the list of documents.

This extra step to the workflow quickly got annoying. I replaced the
reply confirmation page with a flashed notification confirming that the
reply was stored, and a redirect back to the page for the source that
was replied to.

Moved the explanation of reply/source interaction to the Journalist
User Manual and deleted the screenshot of the removed `reply.html` page."

Now that we use Ansible and control the package dependencies via Debian
packaging, it's not possible to install SecureDrop without also
installing gpg2. Therefore, this test is no longer needed.

In addition, the response to not finding gpg2 was questionable (not sure
how the WSGI/web server would react to the assertion). This is also a
bad separation of concerns - dependency management should be separate
from the application code as much as possible.

Additionally, the initial call out to the gpg binary to check the
version was temporarily creating a key directory in `/var/www/.gnupg`,
which caused AppArmor errors. Since the version check isn't needed
anyway, the easiest way to fix this error is just to remove the check."

variables by default (this is a security feature, see the man page), so
following this documentation resulted in always building the kernel with
a single core.

environment variable and building the kernel. When tested, this change

This fixes two annoying problems with the way building packages used to
work:

1. The built .debs and files downloaded as part of the build process

repo, which was a lot of clutter. Now they are stored in their own
dedicated directory, `build`.
2. In order to be used in conjunction with the `install_local_pkgs`
Ansible tag, the .debs used to have to be manually moved to
`install_files/ansible-base`, which was an annoying step that was easy
to forget. Now it looks in the build directory, which is where the debs
are put automatically."

I updated the firewall rules slightly to match a working configuration
that was tested today. There are several options for how to set up the
rules to allow traffic from the Admin Workstation, and I was not sure
how to best express them in the iptables format, so I just added a
comment to the rules template. I also removed several lines of comments
that are irrelevant after recent changes.

I reworked the Network Firewall documentation completely. The primary
change was in recommending that users *not* use the default subnet of
192.168.1.1 for the LAN subnet, since it conflicts when connected to
another router that uses that (very common) subnet. I also explained
what is necessary to successfully configure the WAN in a both more
detailed and more abstract way. I added much more detailed documentation
for the initial configuration of the firewall. I edited the tips for
setting up the firewall rules based on some recent changes.

Finally, I added some screenshots from a working pfSense firewall
configuration."

The network firewall and iptables rules were previously allowing Tor
only on a set of common Tor relay ports (see
https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#OutboundPorts). However, we
removed that restriction from Tor's configuration in #735 since it
appeared to cause problems during a recent install.

Allowing Tor to use any port, but blocking traffic to those ports in
both the server and network firewalls could cause connectivity
issues. Additionally, the Tor documentation recommends using any
advertised port to connect to relays if possible, in order to take
advantage of the most diversity of relays (see previous FAQ link).

Getting rid of these ""multiport"" restrictions allows us to simplify the
firewall rules somewhat, since we must now allow outbound TCP on any
port and don't need to open specific ports for TCP anymore. In the case
of the network firewall rules, these rules were removed since currently
those rules must be manually entered into the pfSense WebGUI which is
quite annoying. We left most of the now-redundant rules in the iptables
rules, since they are automatically set up during the install
process. Leaving them in gives a clearer picture of the overall traffic
flows to someone reading the rules, and could be helpful if we decide to
reverse this decision in the future and restrict outbound TCP by port
again."

According to the OpenSSH 6.7 release document (http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.7), the CBC ciphers are now considered ""unsafe"". Thus, I have removed the blowfish-cbc and aes256-cbc ciphers. Newer, secure ciphers are available in the version of OpenSSH that ships with Ubuntu 14.04 and I have suggested you add aes256-gcm@openssh.com and chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com.

This is a kludge, but a reasonably effective one. This change reboots
the servers every day at 5am. Previously this reboot would only happen
if required by the daily package upgrade (e.g. for a kernel upgrade),
but now it happens every day regardless of whether it is needed.

This ensures that the plaintext of submissions can reside in memory for
at most 24 hours after submission. Resolves #99, although we can and
should do better in a future release."

have to wait for the next TOTP token before attempting to log in again.

Previously the `Version:` of the securedrop-grsec kernel metapackage was
tracking the SecureDrop/securedrop-app-code version. Since the
metapackage tracks the grsecurity upgrades, and is independent of the
version of SecureDrop, it makes sense for the version of the metapackage
to match the grsecurity version.

Updated the deb builder (which we currently only use to build
securedrop-grsec) to get the version for the filename from the Debian
control file. This is important, since in my testing aptly refused to
add two packages with the same filename to the same repo (even if their
`Version:`s were different).

Also makes `build_meta` slightly more generic, to fit its name and
intended purpose. Also changed some variable names for clarity."

I did this for two reasons:

1. We aren't using any packages from the repo to build the debs at the
moment (if you think about it, that's kind of a catch-22), so commenting
this has no impact on building debs. Also, running `apt-get update`,
which is relativley slow, for no reason is a waste of time.

2. During testing, this created a catch-22 where I wanted to build the
debs so I could add them to the repo and publish the snapshot, but this
deb builder script wouldn't run unless the repo already existed.

We may be able to remove this code entirely, but I decided to leave it
in for now in case it is useful for something that I didn't recognize."

In order to serve bulk downloads with X-Send-File, we need to save them
in a SecureDrop-specific temp directory to avoid allowing Apache to
serve all of a default temp directory such as `/tmp`.

This commit also adds timestamps to the bulk download .zip filenames to
make them easier to work with.

Tested successfully on staging."

Loading the JS warning bubble in the initial HTML (it is hidden at first
by the CSS) triggers the loads for the icons right away. Previously, we
were generating the bubble's HTML in JS and then appending it to body,
which triggered the image loads once the element added (and thus,
visible). This caused the bubble to load without the icons at first due
to Tor's general sluggishness.

Doing it this way means the icons will probably already be loaded by the
time the user has read the JS warning and decided to click the link,
which provides a better experience overall."

Functional tests have recently been failing due to ""out of memory""
errors. My theory is that this is due to the new release of Firefox,
which came out two days ago (and usually takes a day or so to make it
into the mainline repos) using more memory than the previous release.
Timelines match up, although I haven't done any further testing to prove
this.

Nice side effect: increasing the amount of available memory makes
Firefox run faster, which makes the functional tests run faster. Also
appears to eliminate various intermittent errors from the functional
tests, such as the ""empty status line"" error from Selenium and the
TypeError from python-gnupg. This makes sense!"

Python-RQ is nice because it lets us schedule jobs that are arbitrary
Python functions. The downside is that, due to our messy ""config as a
module with values derived from an environment variable"" setup, there
can be issues. For example, jobs sent from the tests will not run
correctly on the default worker (started by supervisor), because they
were started with different values for SECUREDROP_ENV and therefore have
different SECUREDROP_ROOTs.

Clearly this whole situation needs to be improved but this hack is
reasonable and works well for now:

1. Use a separate ""test"" queue for jobs triggered by the tests
2. Start/stop a temporary ""test""-queue-only rqworker for the tests"

This merge changes the default database settings so mysql is not required for
development (use the built-in sqlite instead). It also integrates the database
with the tests, using a temporary sqlite database instead of re-using an
existing databsae, which could cause problems.

If you experience errors related to missing tables after updating, make sure
you've updated your config with the database settings, then run `python -c
""import db; db.create_tables()""`."

necessary for the generation of source designations by the journalist.
HACKING.md and setup_ubuntu.sh have both been modified to add this piece
of infrustructure. setup_ubuntu requires no additional user input for
this step, and modifies config.py accordingly.

This adds an additional 2 pip dependencies:
MySQL-python
SQLAlchemy

The db.py module uses SQLAlchemy to define the tables and perform
database functions.

We are storing the codenames in the database which can be queried with
the sid.

New codenames are generated with two new dictionaries, located in
deaddrop/dictionaries, with an adjective and noun pair. This is
memorable for the journalist. These dictionaries were generated with the
python natural language toolkit, using the wordnik database."

Now that the journalist can delete documents, it's confusing if they delete all
documents. Then the source's collection ""disappears"" from the main list,
leaving them with no way to reply to the source unless the source sends another
submission.

it would be better to display the number of documents in the main list, and
allow journalists to sort the list of collections by the number of documents
contained."

Adds ids to forms so they can be distinguished by the tests. Small fix to silly
broken code for detecting if the upload form includes a file upload.

The ValueError exception that occurs after the tests run is spurious. It is
caused by a call out to generate a key for the source, which is async.
Meanwhile the tests continue, and tearDownModule wipes out the test directory,
so when gpg is done generating the key it has no keyring to write it to and
exits with an extra-special error code."

To run, `./test.py`

The test harness sets an environment variable before importing config.py, which
tells config to use a ""test environment"" (store dir, key dir, and journalist
key) instead of the production environment.

I created a journalist keypair and included it in the repo for testing.
Generating a GPG keypair can be very time-consuming, and we want to be able to
run tests as fast as possible. The keypair is clearly marked so it is not used
by anyone for anything besides testing this application."
