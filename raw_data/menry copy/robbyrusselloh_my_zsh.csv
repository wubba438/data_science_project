For the `v` alias to work in its current state, the environment variable
EDITOR must already be defined by the time `source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh`
happens. However, in the included zshrc template, EDITOR is set from
within the ""User configuration"" section, which begins immediately after
the above line. This means that, unless the user knows to move their
`export EDITOR` statements, EDITOR will be undefined when fasd.plugin.zsh
loads, and therefore the alias will have the value 'f -e """"', preventing
it from functioning.

With this change, `""$EDITOR""` will be evaluated each time the alias is
invoked, instead of just once when the alias is created. This allows for
EDITOR to be set from ""User configuration"" in the zshrc, and has the
additional flexibility of allowing a user to specify a different EDITOR
for a single session or invocation of the alias."

Changes the prefix/suffix variable names to ZSH_THEME_RUBY_PROMPT_PREFIX and

Revert cab1ac6e682038b2ceca9d16f8c458c0e79149ca

The change from the above commit breaks opening a new emacs frame if
there isn't a existing frame open.

When emacs is running in daemon mode, there will always be a frame
associated with the daemon, even if there are no visible frames.

The lisp function `frame-list`, will always return 1 frame.
```
emacsclient --eval '(frame-list)'
(#<frame F1 0xa3c680>)
```

When an real frame is open, two frames are reported by the `frame-list`
function.
```
emacsclient --eval '(frame-list)'
(#<frame F1 0xa3c680> #<frame emacs Prelude - ~/oh-my-zsh/plugins/emacs/emacsclient.sh 0xf50e10>)

This change references `$RANDOM` outside the subshell to refresh it for the
next subshell invocation. Otherwise, subsequent runs of the function get the
same value and, if run simultaneously, they may clobber each others' temp .z
files.

This is due to how zsh distributes RANDOM values when running inside a
subshell:

  subshells that reference RANDOM will result in identical pseudo-random
  values unless the value of RANDOM is referenced or seeded in the parent
  shell in between subshell invocations

The environment variable name used to be AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE but the
CLI documentation now only mentions AWS_PROFILE.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html

It seems like the CLI was the only tool using AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE, and
all the AWS SDKs used AWS_PROFILE, so they standardized on it.

https://onetechnical.wordpress.com/2016/10/07/the-curious-case-of-aws_default_profile/

Note: still left AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE on the method to set the profile to
maintain backwards compatibility.

Fixes #7268

the $USER value, like if the user is part of an AD domain.

With `%n` the quoting is done automatically by zsh.

This has the same behavior as zsh's hook function execution, which tries to run
the functions in the order specified and silently ignores any function that
does not exist.

Also moved duplicate nopushdminus logic to the `switch-to-dir` function."

Per the [`go` command specification](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Package_lists),
the `...` wildcard matches the empty string. This makes commands like
`go <action> . ./...` unnecessary: they should use `go <action> ./...`.

This also fixes a bug with the `gofa` shortcut, where it would emit an
error if called from a directory containing no go source files (but
having subdirectories that _did_ contain go files)."

When a commit has multiple tags associated to it, the git-prompt will
throw the following error:

git_super_status:[:4: integer expression expected: v0.21.x\ntags/v0.21.5,
git_super_status:[:7: integer expression expected: origin/v0.21.x,

git_super_status:[:14: integer expression expected: v0.21.x
git_super_status:[:23: integer expression expected: v0.21.x

This is due to the prompt expecting the tag field to be a single word
with no spaces in between but if there are multiple tags the python
script returns a string with ', ' space separated list of tags.
This throws off the parser. The solution is to ensure that the python
script returns a space-less string ensuring the git-prompt parser to
properly parse the data.

The option '-F' causes 'less' to automatically quit if the contents fit 
the screen and the option '-X' causes 'less' to not clear the screen after 
quit. I think both options are generally useful for terminal applications.

They are in particular useful for Git as it runs all output through a
pager. Git will run 'less' with '-FRX' by default if the environment 
variable $LESS is not defined [1]. Since oh-my-zsh used to set $LESS to 
'-R', Git would not override this setting. Consequently, Git would 
display even a single line of output in a pager and the user would need
to explicitly quit that pager (see mailing list discussion [2]).

Therefore, lets change the oh-my-zsh default value for $LESS to '-FRX'.
This would be useful for oh-my-zsh Git users and likely for users of
other applications that use 'less' too.

* Plugin for iTerm2 on OSX

iTerm2 is a popular terminal emulator for OSX (https://www.iterm2.com).

The plugin currently implements one function, iterm2_profile, which
allows easily changing the currently selected user settings profile,
without creating a new tab or window, just by calling the function.

For example, this is handy for switching from a dark to a light colored
profile without having to re-open anything.

In addition, it also works within tmux running inside iTerm2.

* iTerm2 Plugin: Run any iTerm2 command

Refactored the plugin so that it can run arbitrary iTerm2 commands.
Should work with any of the supported commands, see

This is the default behavior of rbenv and what users are expecting
most of the time.

It allows users to have their own set of rubies and gems. It also
prevents losing all rubies when rbenv is updated using Homebrew which
is not true when RBENV_ROOT is set to /usr/local/opt/rbenv."

* Improve UX for Spotify commands in osx plugin

Spotify command UX is a bit weak for people who live and work almost entirely in shells.
- `spotify quit` should not open Spotify if it is not already running. Should confirm that Spotify is indeed not running.
- `spotify quit` should not blow away the user's shell once Spotify is quit. This can be a disruption to work flow.

This PR looks to add a few little checks which will help improve this experience.
This PR also adds a space to line 477 between `break` and `;;` for consistency. Doesn't seem like a big enough change to put in its own PR.

* Rearranging output as per peer feedback

* osx plugin's spotify: change quitting w/ closing

Closing is more idiomatic English."

* cp plugin: remove `--` to separate files from options

This has some undesired effects, like having `cpv --help` be a file
not found error.

Use `--` yourself if you need it (which you generally don't):

```zsh
cpv -- -some-file-with-hyphens.txt /tmp
```

Added this same info to the README."

When making a WIP commit, we generally just want to save the state of the

purposes, or change branch to work on something else. Therefore, it's generally
undesirable to run Git hooks, which might do things like run linters, because
we probably don't care if our WIP has lint errors."

This deletes the previous hack that allowed completing files with
the extension: e.g. `abcd.z` to `abcdefg.z`.

It is still possible to use `abcd[TAB].z`, and hyphens or underscores
are very much more important than this other trick.

* Improve gradle plugin task parsing

Added _gradle and _gradlew as symbolic links to gradle.plugin.zsh,
otherwise the plugin was not properly loaded.

Output from `gradlew tasks --all` is now parsed in two levels,
first we find segments between `------...` and a newline.
Second, all those lines are parsed and cleaned using awk
and added to .gradletasknamecache.

Tested on gradle 2.13, and gradlew 2.14.

* Remove .gradletasknamecache before regenerating it

Remove the .gradletasknamecache file to avoid having an unnecessary
newline at the top of the file when regenerating it.

* Improve gradle task parsing by writing .gradletasknamecache atomically

Previously the .gradletasknamecache file was written line by line inside a parsing loop,
which could cause errors such as half-written cache files if the process was aborted.

This also removes the need of deleting the .gradletasknamecache file before parsing."

Otherwise `start` will confuse the first parameter as the title of
a new command prompt if the parameter contains whitespace. That is
because the command to be run will be:

    start ""abc def""

which opens a new command prompt window with the title ""abc def"".
With the added empty string we force the start command to interpret
the passed parameter as the file / command:

    start """" ""abc def""

which will be interpreted like `""""` is the title and the rest is
the file or command to start.

-------

**NOTE:** this wouldn't be necessary if the start script in msys
was defined differently; that is, if it had the empty string
already incorporated in the script (/usr/bin/start), like so:

```diff
-cmd //c start ""${@//&/^&}""
+cmd //c start """" ""${@//&/^&}""
```

Notice however that this would make it impossible to use start
setting a different title, so it's probably best to leave it as is.

More info: http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/tickets/14/

-------

The change `${(z)open_cmd}` is necessary to force zsh to split the
variable by the spaces and interpret it as separate words.

This changeset wraps all of the commands in tools/install.sh in a
function and then calls that function as the last line of the
script.

The current install instructions ask the user to download the install
script using `curl` and pass the result to `sh`. This is totally
fine (as long as both the instructions and the script itself are served
using HTTPS), but the script should be written in a way such that it
doesn't start trying to actually *do* anything until the very last line.

The reason is due to the way `curl` work: if the socket drops before the
request is complete (server abruptly hangs up, client's internet flakes
out, etc.), `curl` will return the partial data that it received. Here
is an example of that:

![partial file execution](https://cldup.com/qU_Mnh2GmT.png)

A way this might cause issues for tools/install.sh is if the connection drops
after cloning but before the repository (L53-56). The .zshrc
configuration will not be copied and the shell will not be changed, but
if the user tries to run the install script again it will claim
oh-my-zsh is already installed (L31-39).

While this is not a particularly dangerous error condition (the user can
just delete .oh-my-zsh and re-run), it can certainly be confusing for
new users. This also helps future-proof the script for a time when it
might need to use a ""dangerous"" command, e.g. `rm`, and we want to make
sure it happens in the most transactional way possible."

This commit uses the (hopefully) standard rmam and smam escape sequences

This is so that extra dots that don't fit the current line won't be
displayed in the next line, which would in turn make the shell
display a new prompt on the next line after the dots are hidden.

I've added a check for $terminfo rmam and smam values to be sure we have
them before printing them out.

I frequently need to execute random command in my shell. To achieve it I pause
Vim by pressing Ctrl-z, type command and press fg<Enter> to switch back to Vim.

The fg part really hurts me. I just wanted to hit Ctrl-z once again to get back
to Vim.
I could not find a solution, so I developed one on my own that works wonderfully
with ZSH.

Problem

On detached-refs, the git prompt is very slow because it uses a command
to output all refs, which takes 32s on the twitter internal git repo.

Solution

Use git-rev-parse instead of git-show-ref to only output the head ref.
Runtime drops to 0.03 seconds.

Note

Interestingly, git-rev-parse isn't slow without the --head arguement so
I'll probably be cooking up a patch for the git team to speed this up
eventually, but it's still pointless to sigpipe git as it walks the
filesystem."

This adds two new theme functions for git:
* `git_prompt_behind` works in a identical fashion to `git_prompt_ahead`
  and will output a format variable (`ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_BEHIND`) if
  the branch is behind.
* `git_prompt_remote` will output one format variable if the branch
  exists on remote (`ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_REMOTE_EXISTS`), and another
  if the branch is unpublished (`ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_REMOTE_MISSING`).

The old `git_prompt_ahead` has been changed. Using git log is subject
to formatting in .gitconfig, which can be overridden and will break
this function. Relying on rev-list is much more stable."

This way the user can keep their preferred pushd syntax while enabling
us to use a standard syntax in our defined functions.

To explain further, without a clear value on the PUSHD_MINUS option, we
could be changing the +1/-0 values all we want, that some user would
find that it didn't work for him.

We have two options, then:
- Setting a particular value, which was my first approach.
- Using `emulate -L zsh` to ensure all options defined in the function's
  body won't be passed along to the main zsh instance.

This change follows this proposed behaviour:

 Ctrl+Shift+Left:  move to last visited directory
 Ctrl+Shift+Right: move to next visited directory

an alternative behaviour would be:

 Ctrl+Shift+Left:  move directory to the left in `dirs` output
 Ctrl+Shift+Right: move directory to the right in `dirs` output

It also introduces `setopt nopushdminus` as a way to standardise
pushd syntax. It's value wasn't clear before, which has been the
cause of so many pull requests regarding this plugin not working
in some environments."

iTunes interface. The toggle option ""clicks"" the shuffle button in the
Now Playing area. This has the effect of toggling the shuffle setting on
whatever is currently playing. The on and off options use the Shuffle
menu bar items.

mcornella,2014-07-26 21:26:12,https://api.github.com/repos/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/git/commits/142a6c7fd5bcda6c45c25aca582972a7d4e1da85,142a6c7fd5bcda6c45c25aca582972a7d4e1da85,"Fix pass zsh completion and autoloading

When autocompleting from `pass <TAB>', sometimes the following errors
appear:

  _values:compvalues:10: not enough arguments
  find: `/home/user/.password-store': No such file or directory
  _values:compvalues:10: not enough arguments
  find: `/home/user/.password-store': No such file or directory

The `_values' error happens when there is no password-store folder *or*
there are no passwords in pass; the `find' error only when there is no
password-store folder.

We can trace it back to line 108, which contains the only `_values'
statement that is executed when we autocomplete from pass. We confirm
this by following the trail of execution, which is

  _pass -> _pass_cmd_show -> _pass_complete_entries ->
        -> _pass_complete_entries_helper

If we try running the command inside `$()' on line 104, we see that it
returns nothing and the output is blank. This means that `_values' only
receives 1 of its 2 mandatory parameters, therefore the above error is
triggered (not enough arguments).

That is unless we don't have a password-store folder, in which case the
`find: [...] no such file or directory' error is *also* triggered.

We solve the first error by supplying a default value of """" if the
command outputs nothing, using the zsh construct ${var:-else}.

We solve the second error by redirecting the find command's stderr output
to /dev/null, so the error is effectively suppressed.

* * * *

This patch also fixes the first tab completion, which currently only
loads the completion function definition.

We do this by adding a `_pass' statement at the end of the file, which
runs the `_pass' completion function after loading its definition.
This is the standard way an autoloaded function works; for other examples
look at zsh's official completion files."

Merged from #2906

The function `git_prompt_info` calls `git config` for its stdout output,
but doesn't handle the stderr output.  This can lead to problems,
e.g. if the git config file is unreadable for some reason (permissions
etc).

This fixes the issue by simply ignoring the stderr output."

The intention of the redirection to /dev/null is to hide the output
'hash: no such command: git' since we rely on the exit status.

However, the output goes to stderr, so it's stderr that needs to be
redirected. For completeness, we redirect both stderr and stdout using
'2>&1'.

Example:

  [~]$ hash git > /dev/null
  [~]$ PATH=''
  [~]$ hash git > /dev/null

The manual configuration of ':completion:*:hosts' causes some problems
(e.g. issue #1337), and misses useful information (especially from
~/.ssh/known_hosts; issue #690 and issue #1009).

The best option appears to be using zsh's default configuration for
':completion:*:hosts'.

While rebasing this for a new pull request (#1498 got closed by accident
and then requests to re-open it got ignored), it also drops the `users
off` setting: completion of user names can be useful, and the commit
adding it (c4434d2) does not state why."

Switch to using curl and regular expressions to generate a local cache
file so that we don't need to hit pypi.python.org every time.
This (obviously) results in a massive speed improvement, especially if
you spawn new shells frequently.

This also makes the autocompletion work for me, it didn't before. (pip
would always time out.)

And, also, for fun: This allows you to explicitly set which pip indexes
to use. Technically the old version of the plugin should have had this
behavior automatically -- without having to do more than configure pip
-- but the install completion never worked for me so this is a net gain
in functionality."

The GPG_ENV file is sourced before doing the gpg-connect-agent check,

being spawned.

Certain themes need the 'clean' mark, and some people like to have the

We probably shouldn't be modifying that function, there's no other clean
way to achieve our own status information, so let's try to emulate the
original as much as possible.

#1445 is great, if you use node.  For those that don't this should mean we can find a reasonable fallback.
Users can force urltools to use a specific system by setting `URLTOOLS_METHOD` to one of:
* `node`
* `python`
* `ruby`
* `php`
* `perl`

Note that you can't (currently) choose which `perl` sublibrary to use, it will use either `URI::Encode`, `URI::Escape`, or regular expressions in that order of preference."

This reverts commit b609aa0e6c981f2039d777687cb01a84587f6edc -- this commit
was a bad idea, because it makes vi-mode very difficult to use. The default
`bindkey` keybindings are NOT MEANT to coexist with `bindkey -v` Vi mode;
that's why `bindkey -v` clears them in the first place! Restoring all of the
default keybindings after enabling Vi mode, the way the reverted commit did,
causes many collisions between those default keybindings that begin with ESC
and the command-mode-initiating ESC of Vi mode. See Issue 1438 of
robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh. If people have custom keybindings, they should create
them in their ~/.zshrc AFTER enabling the vi-mode plugin and sourcing
oh-my-zsh.sh.

   directory history to using the global history.  In both cases the history is
   always saved to both the global history and the directory history, so the
   toggle state will not effect the saved histories.  Being able to switch
   between global and directory histories on the fly is a novel feature as far
   as I am aware.

the vi-mode plugin destroys any bindings made before it is sourced due to the

of outstanding issues due to people using vi-mode and having things in oh-my-zsh

This patch makes git_prompt_status support three new status variables:

With these extra variables it's easy to see (1) if you have commits in
your local branch that weren't pushed to the remote (AHEAD), (2) if
there are commits in the remote that you haven't merged/rebased yet
(BEHIND) or (3) if you have local unpushed commits AND the remote has
some commits you haven't merged yet (DIVERGED).

Refer to the first line displayed on `git status -b --porcelain`.

An example setup in a .zsh-theme file would be:

Term window title and tab title are now skinable
Tab title can be different from window title (when supported by term)
Default theme is optimized of usuability (no %u@%m: $~ in a 10 char tab)
Cleanup code duplication and add comment for supported terms
On osX it works great on iterm, and is decent once you tweak Terminal pref
Tested under GNU screen, iTerm and Apple Terminal, need to be tested on linux
TODO implement Konsole support (via dbus)"

On my linux virtual terminals, where TERM=""linux"", I was getting
annoying output that was messing up my prompt.

It turns out the title function was always matching on the elif
statement for xterm/rxvt no matter what and the linux vt doesn't know
what to do with the title special control sequence and thus was printing
out garbage.

Through experimentation I figured out that the || inside of the [[ ]]
did not work:

export TERM=linux
$ if [[ $TERM =~ ""^xterm"" || $TERM == ""rxvt"" ]]; then echo $TERM; fi
linux

$ if [[ $TERM =~ ""^xterm"" ]] || [[ $TERM == ""rxvt"" ]]; then echo $TERM; fi

     * ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_SUFFIX - The very end of the prompt
     * ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_DIRTY - Displayed when the branch is dirty
     * ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_CLEAN - Displayed when the branch is clean
 * Updated geoffgarside, robbyrussell, and maran to work with new git
   theme
 * Added the Risto theme, which is very similar to a number of bash
   prompts, and allows me to use zsh in with out my co-workers knowing I
   have the advantage. Think of it as a ninja theme."
