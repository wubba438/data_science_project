This commit fixes various issues with screen readers in the main OBS
interface. These were tested using NVDA on Windows 10 1903.

Checkboxes or buttons which toggle, when receiving an activate signal
from the screen reader would visually update, but not perform any
action. This is because they're listening only for clicks. They should
all now be listening for toggles instead.

The screen reader would navigate through the UI in the order that
elements are defined in the .ui XML, and not by their row positions.
The XML has been reordered so that things should be defined in their row
order.

Audio track selection now says Track 1, 2, etc, rather than just the
number. Various checkboxes that just say ""Enable"" now have accessible
text that says what the enable is for (since it says ""checkbox"", the
fact it's an enable should hopefully be clear). Type in the recording
tab of output now has accessible text which says ""Recording Type"".

All the right side buttons in hotkeys now have tooltips, and by
extension, accessible text. Currently it does not yet say what hotkey
the action is in relation to, but that would require more locales."

Before, we were calling DestroyWindow on the browser panel HWND from the
CEF UI thread, which meant that the main program thread had to process
window messages in order for that message to successfully through as
DestroyWindow blocks on the WM_DESTROY/WM_NCDESTROY window messages.
Unfortunately, this also had the side-effect of processing all queued Qt
events, which, when called in the destructor of a window like this, can
result in undefined behavior; specifically crashes, which were occurring
due to this.  Especially when browser panels were in docks and docked to
the main window.

So, instead of calling DestroyWindow in another thread and then
processing events in the main thread, call DestroyWindow directly in the
main thread to get WM_DESTROY/WM_NCDESTROY and only those processed on
the spot.  This appears to fix the crashes due to the undefined
behavior when closing browser panels."

This fixes a bug where pause data could get corrupted if
pausing/unpausing too fast, because the audio/video encoders aren't

Adds the ""audio_line"" internal source type as a bare source type for the
sole purpose of outputting audio, and the obs_source_info::audio_mix
callback which allows mixing of those audio lines, which is then treated
as normal audio for the source.  Audio line objects should be added as
sub-sources when multiple audio lines from a single source are needed,
then mixed together with the audio_mix callback.

The difference between the new obs_source_info::audio_mix callback and
obs_source_info::audio_render is that obs_source_info::audio_mix (along
with the audio_line source) are only one track, and it outputs audio to
the source automatically via obs_source_output_audio() when the call
completes.  This allows the mixed audio to be treated like a normal
source's audio, in that you can filter it, change its volume, or monitor
it.

This change was necessary because the CEF (used with the browser source)
outputs multiple audio streams at once to a single browser source, so
it's the program's responsibility to mix those streams together itself."

The dynamic bitrate operates based upon estimating the current bitrate

congestion is detected as a replacement for dropping frames.

This may still need adjustment, as it is difficult to accurately emulate
real-world frame drop scenarios.  This does not currently drop frames at
all, and because of that, very high congestion may cause additional
stream delay to viewers (because data will be buffered), but from
limited testing, most congestion will not cause that and it can safely
recover pretty quickly without adding significant delay."

complicated and suffering precision issues. Breaking them up into
separate textures makes the shaders much simpler and avoids having to
compute large integer offsets. Unfortunately, the code to handle
multiple textures is not as pleasant, but at least the NV12 rendering
path is no longer separate.

In addition, write chroma samples to ""standard"" offsets. For I444,
there's no difference, but I420/NV12 formats now have chroma shifted to
the left as 4:2:0 is shown in the H.264 specification.

There are devices like the GV-USB2 that produce frames with smmoth
timestamps at an uneven pace, which causes OBS to stutter because the
unbuffered path is designed to aggressively operate on the latest frame.

We can make the unbuffered path work by making two adjustments:

- Don't discard the current frame until it has elapsed.
- Don't skip frames in the queue until they have elapsed.

The buffered path still has problems with deinterlacing GV-USB2 output,
but the unbuffered path is better anyway.

Testing:

GV-USB2, Unbuffered: Stuttering is gone!
GV-USB2, Buffered: No regression (still broken).
SC-512N1-L/DVI, Unbuffered: No regression (still works).
SC-512N1-L/DVI, Buffered: No regression (still works)."

As the names entered into this dialog can be used as part of file names

in silent data loss where OBS creates the collection and allows the user

MAX_PATH limitation on Windows (260 characters). 170 was chosen to
accomodate the length of the user app data folder plus some room for

If an audio source does not provide enough data at a steady pace, the
timestamp update does not happen, and buffering increases until it
maxes out. To counteract this, update the timestamp anyway.

adjusted for divergence from system time. Making this adjustment is

If a device produces video and audio timestamps atdifferent rates,
this divergence can cause massive buffering on the audio side, leading
to a capped audio buffer, and total sound loss. This change allows a
hardcoded list of devices to use the existing decoupling logic. For
now, only ""GV-USB2"" has been added.

When combined with another fix, 5+ hours of stable audio without any
buffering on my GV-USB2 where it used to drop sound completely after
an hour or so.

in the repository root directory and put commits in the file to ignore such
commits.

The cache coherency of rasterization for full-screen passes is better
using an oversized triangle that is clipped rather than two triangles.
Traversal order of rasterization is GPU-specific, but will almost
certainly be better using an undivided primitive.

A smaller benefit is that quads along the diagonal are not evaluated
multiple times, but that's minor in comparison.

Redo format shaders to bypass vertex buffer, and input layout. Add
global shader bool ""obs_glsl_compile"" to make API-specific decisions,
i.e. handle upside-down UVs. gl_ortho is not needed for format
conversion because the vertex shader does not use ViewProj anymore.

This can be applied to more situations, but start small first.

Normally, paired encoders are unpaired when they stop.  However, if the
pairing occurs before the encoders actually start, and the encoders
never actually end up starting, they are never unpaired, and that
pairing stays with them until the next time an output is started up
again.  That in turn can cause an output that uses one of the encoders
but not the other to not function correctly, and neither properly
""start"" nor stop because the data is queued continually in the
interleaved packet array.

For example, let's say there are two outputs, two video encoders, and
one audio encoder.  This can be reproduced by using advanced output mode
and making the two outputs use separate video encoders while sharing
track 1's audio encoder.  If you start up the stream output first and it
fails to fully connect for whatever reason (bad server, bad stream key,
etc), then you start up the recording output, the recording output will
appear to be running, but will not stop when you hit ""stop recording"".
It will stay perpetually on ""stopping recording"" and will get stuck that
way.  This is because when the streaming output started, the streaming
output would initially pair video encoder A with audio encoder A before
the encoders actually fully started up (as the encoders do not fully
start up until a connection is successfully made), and when the
recording output starts up after that disconnection, audio encoder A
will wait for video encoder A rather than video encoder B because that
pairing was never actually cleared.

So, instead of pairing encoders when the output starts, wait until the
encoders themselves are being started and then pair the encoders at that
point in time.  This ensures that the encoders start up and will clear
their pairing when no longer in use."

(This commit also modifies the UI, obs-ffmpeg, and obs-output modules)

Fixes a long-time regression where the program would lock up if an
encode call fails.  Shuts down all outputs associated with the failing
encoder and displays an error message to the user.

Ideally, it would be best if a more detailed error could be displayed to
the user about the nature of the error, though the primary problem is
the encoder errors are typically not something the user would be able to
understand.  The current message is a bit of a generic error message;
improvement is welcome.

Another suggestion is to try to have the encoder restart seamlessly,
though it would take a significant amount of work to be able to make it
do something like that properly, and it sort of assumes that encoder
failures are sporadic, which may not necessarily be the case with some
hardware encoders on some systems.  It may be better just to use another
encoder in that case.  For now, seamless restart is ruled out."

There are cases where alpha is multiplied unnecessarily. This change
attempts to use premultiplied alpha blending for composition.

To keep this change simple, The filter chain will continue to use
straight alpha. Otherwise, every source would need to modified to output
premultiplied, and every filter modified for premultiplied input.

""DrawAlphaDivide"" shader techniques have been added to convert from
premultiplied alpha to straight alpha for final output. ""DrawMatrix""
techniques ignore alpha, so they do not appear to need changing.

One remaining issue is that scale effects are set up here to use the
same shader logic for both scale filters (straight alpha - incorrectly),
and output composition (premultiplied alpha - correctly). A fix could be
made to add additional shaders for straight alpha, but the ""real"" fix
may be to eliminate the straight alpha path at some point.

For graphics, SrcBlendAlpha and DestBlendAlpha were both ONE, and could
combine together to form alpha values greater than one. This is not as
noticeable of a problem for UNORM targets because the channels are
clamped, but it will likely become a problem in more situations if FLOAT
targets are used.

This change switches DestBlendAlpha to INVSRCALPHA. The blending
behavior of stacked transparents is preserved without overflowing the
alpha channel.

obs-transitions: Use premultiplied alpha blend, and simplify shaders
because both inputs and outputs use premultiplied alpha now.

The workarounds were made because of conflicts with running multiple UI
threads at once on macOS, which macOS can't do very well, and would be
susceptible to crashes.  This would cause crashes not only on startup
but seemingly at random when using the browser source on macOS.  The
original ""fix"" was a hack to try to minimize UI code and browser UI code
from executing at the same time.  The macOS initial scene loading was
deferred until all Qt-related and main window initialization was
completed.  Although this worked to some extent to prevent conflicts, it
made it so that there was an initial period on startup where the entire
UI seemed ""blank"" for users, and it was still possible for the main UI
thread and the browser UI thread to clash, causing crashes seemingly at
random for users.

The external message pump method of CEF is the solution to the problem,
which is the method which allows the main UI thread to share events with
CEF.  To do this, all CEF operations need to be performed in the UI
thread (Qt's main thread), and CefDoMessageLoopWork() needs to be called
when CefApp::OnScheduleMessagePumpWork callback is triggered.  A number
of other issues had to be solved as well, such as CefBrowser references
getting ""stuck"" in the Qt event queue.

With this, macOS no longer needs to do the ""deferred load"" hack, and
browsers are now much more stable and no longer as susceptible to
seemingly random crashes, improving overall program stability when
browsers are used."

Fixes handling of the `obs_source_frame::full_range` member variable,
which is often set to false by default by many plugins even when using
RGB, which would cause RGB to be marked as ""partial range"".  This change
is crucial for when partial range RBG support is implemented.

Adds `obs_source_frame2` structure that replaces the `full_range` member
variable with a `range` variable, which uses the `video_range_type` enum
to allow handling default range values.  This member variable treats
VIDEO_RANGE_DEFAULT as full range if the format is RGB, and partial
range if the format is YUV.

Also adds `obs_source_output_video2` and `obs_source_preload_video2`
functions which use the `obs_source_frame2` structure instead of the
`obs_source_frame` structure.

When using the original `obs_source_frame`, `obs_source_output_video`,
and `obs_source_preload_video` functions, RGB will always be full range
by default for backward compatibility purposes."

Currently several shaders need ""DrawMatrix"" techniques to support the
possibility that the input texture is a ""YUV"" format. Also, ""DrawMatrix""
is overloaded for translation in both directions when it is written for
RGB to ""YUV"" only.

A cleaner solution is to handle ""YUV"" to RGB up-front as part of format
conversion, and ensure only RGB inputs reach the other shaders. This is
necessary to someday perform correct scale filtering without the cost of
redundant ""YUV"" conversions per texture tap.

A necessary prerequisite for this is to add conversion support for
VIDEO_FORMAT_I444, and that is now in place. There was already a hack in
place to cover VIDEO_FORMAT_Y800. All other ""YUV"" formats already have
conversion functions.

""DrawMatrix"" has been removed from shaders that only supported ""YUV"" to
RGB conversions. It still exists in shaders that perform RGB to ""YUV""
conversions, and the implementations have been sanitized accordingly."

It appears there's a projection flip that is applied in some situations,
like the preview pane in studio mode, and the shader math fails when
it's active causing the output color to be zero. This fixes the math for
GLSL (with a tiny redundancy penalty to HLSL), and cleans up some
unnecessary code along the way.

Use abs() to avoid zero area in case the OpenGL projection flip is
active. Also simplify the math, and remove the unnecessary sampler
state."

This new scale filter computes pixels by weighing the coverage area of
source pixels over the target pixel. This algorithm works well for both
upsampling and downsampling, but was mainly designed to upscale
high-quality low-resolution sources like RGB/HDMI retro consoles. I've
heard of people using odd workarounds like scaling up to very high
resolutions before scaling back down to preserve pixel shartpness. This
algorithm directly addresses this use-case in a much more direct
fashion.

The Area scale filter does a better job of preserving the thickness of
thin features than the Point filter.

The Area scale filter does not look at source pixels that lie outside
of the target pixel, leading to a much sharper image than Bilinear,
Bicubic, and Lanczos filters.

This filter should interpolate pixels in linear space, but OBS is not
equipped to do that at the moment.

libobs: Add GPU effect, and wire up scene serialization.

obs-filters: Add Area as an option for scale_filter.

UI: Add Area as an option for both scene items, and canvas downscaling."

In commit d17ee20863, we attempted to fix a race condition crash in the
Logitech plugin by deferring the ""stream/recording/replay buffer active""
calls to the UI thread.  However, the Logitech plugin loop_function
funciton can call obs_frontend_streaming_active/etc functions while the
UI thread waits for the loop_function thread for many OBS events,
causing a hard lock in the Logitech plugin.  This fixes that by making
the obs_frontend_streaming_active/etc functions completely atomic
instead.  It's a bit of a hack but it's better than accessing objects."

A mono source is currently upmixed by swresampler in the following way:
- for stereo output, FL=FR=input/sqrt(2)
- for other speaker layouts of the outputs, FC=input, other channels
are zeroed.

In the case of stereo output, this leads to a 3dB level decrease which
users have issue with [1].
The obvious fix of adding a 3dB gain is reported to be adding distortions
on some setups [2].
Note that the ""Downmix to Mono"" does not fix this upmix problem, since
it just makes all output channels identical by summing all input channels
and normalizing (by dividing by the number of output channels). This last
normalization step results in a level reduction for a mono input.

[1] This fixes https://obsproject.com/mantis/view.php?id=960.

Normally, the total and skipped frame count for the encoder is performed
in the video-io thread.  However, because a new thread is being
introduced for texture-based encoding, the frontend has no way of being
able to query that.  So, instead of making the frontend query that data
separately, just make the texture encoder thread increment the values of
video-io.  That way, the frontend doesn't need to change any code, and
can continue using the same functions for determining the total/skipped
frame count.

This can cause the frame count to be doubled if both a texture-based
encoder and a raw data encoder is active at the same time, but it's an
acceptable alternative."

This implements a blacklist of devices that ship with NVENC libraries,

think that NVENC was available when it was not.  If these devices are

This is much more efficient than spawning an encoder on startup to see

startup.  Additionally, also much less crash-prone."

It looks like someone actually started working on this feature as there are
translated strings, properties and everything ready - only the control was
missing from the UI. This commit adds that control.

Currently, the range is set to 1-16MB, step 1MB. This is somewhat arbitrary,

If audio monitoring is enabled and set to output only, the

current source audio output timestamp to the current system time, which
would cause audio to use an incorrect starting point from long ago for
the first starting audio segment if audio monitoring is then turned off
some time after having started the source.

Instead, the starting timestamp should be set to 0 if audio monitoring
is enabled with no output to stream, so that if/when audio monitoring is
disabled, it recalculates the starting timestamp of the first audio
packet on the spot again.

If obs audio output is setup to n channels ( 8 >= n > 2), and the

Normally on macOS, scrollbars are supposed to appear/disappear as you
scroll, but they would be on top of the content you're scrolling.
However, Qt has a bug where if you apply a custom theme to scroll bars,
they no longer disappear.  This causes things under the scrollbar (such
as the lock icons in the sources list) to disappear under the scrollbar,
because macOS normally expects those scrollbars to face out.  This fixes
that issue by adding a space to the end of the sources list box items to
allow space for the scrollbar."

of group sub-items are calculated, transformed by their group, and added
to the snapping boundary.  Bounds of group sub-items will now snap as

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.11.

The FindOpenGL module provides an OpenGL::GL target and an
OPENGL_LIBRARIES variable for projects to use for legacy GL interfaces.
When both a legacy GL library (e.g. libGL.so) and GLVND libraries for
OpenGL and GLX (e.g. libOpenGL.so and libGLX.so) are available, the
module must choose between them. It documents an OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE
variable that can be used to specify an explicit preference. When no
such preference is set, the module must choose a default preference.

The default behavior is to default to legacy (OLD) and is deprecated.

otherwise will disable RTMPS.  ""On"" will make it require mbedTLS,

important that if the user wishes to ungroup a group, that they must be

requires duplicating all scene items (as well as their hotkey/private

Contrary to what the name would have you believe, QPointer<> is not used
to delete a pointer when it leaves its specific scope.  Instead, it's
used to check to see if the pointer is still valid.  For most
QWidget-based objects, this is actually fine because QWidgets that are
assigned to layouts or other widgets will automatically be destroyed --
however, for non-widget objects, this can cause a memory leak.

This patch replaces QPointer with QScopedPointer where applicable to
prevent memory leaks.

(This commit also modifies UI)

Changes groups to their own independent type, ""group"".  This allows them
to be used like other regular types, and allows the ability to reference
groups in multiple scenes.  Before, a group would always be linked to
the scene it was in.  This made it cumbersome for users to modify groups
if they had a similar group in multiple scenes (they would have to
modify each group in each scene).  Making groups like other source types
makes more sense to solve this issue so they can be referenced in
multiple scenes at once.  This also removes a significant amount of
group-specific handling code required for implementing groups in the
front-end.

One limitation however: due to the way sub-items of groups are
seamlessly modifiable and sortable as part of the whole scene, the user
cannot have multiple references to the same group within one scene."

Technically, setting the transparency value via a color property isn't
currently supported.  However, some sources/filters will set their alpha
portion of their color value to 0, which would cause the color property
to have a transparent background.  Set the alpha value to 255 for now,
at least until we properly implement support for setting transparency
via the color property (if we ever do)."

With the recent change to fix showing color in the color property widget
when using different themes (b8f03791ea7), a bug was introduced:  when
opening filters with a filter that has a color property, it would sort
of ""bug out"" and recreate over and over.  This is likely due to
something internally with Qt and the stacked layout.  The stacked layout
really is not necessary, so remove the stacked layout and just use the
color label directly."

x264's ""undef"" is unfortunately not what players that don't ignore the

Allows the ability to (optionally) synchronously create/update a

device.  This is useful if creating/destroying scenes/sources very
quickly, and helps minimize the risk of creating new directshow sources
that use the same device, yet may not activate because an existing
source may already exist.  To use, set ""synchronous_activate"" to true in
its settings when updating or creating.  Note that this setting will be
erased after it's used, and will not be saved to user settings, so it
must be set each time in order to be used.

After you call av_frame_alloc(), ffmpeg expects you to fill in certain
fields on the frame, depending on whether it's an audio or video frame.
obs-ffmpeg did this in the two places where it allocates video frames,
but not where it allocates audio frames.  On my system, using trunk
ffmpeg and the Opus codec, this causes OBS to crash while calling
avcodec_send_frame, ultimately because av_frame_copy fails due to
'dst->format < 0' (as 'format' stays at the default of -1), causing a
null pointer to be added to a buffer queue, which later gets
dereferenced.

Oddly, the fields in question can just be copied directly from
corresponding fields in the AVCodecContext, but I don't see any ffmpeg
API to automatically copy all relevant fields, and all the examples I've
seen do it by hand.  So this patch does the same."

always being set to VIDEO_FORMAT_NV12, dispite the presence of code to set

that function to respect the video format choice of the user.

In addition, whilst testing this fix initially, I also discovered that the
4:4:4 colour format is not supported by the VideoToolbox H264 encoder.
Looking at the VideoToolbox code in ffmpeg as a reference, the ffmpeg code
errors out if a color format other than NV12 or I420 is set. Therefore, this
commit also logs a warning about I444 not being supported, and uses the NV12
default."

The windows media foundation H264 encoders have been deprecated for over
a year, and microsoft's media foundation AAC encoder has had a continued
issue with occasional random audio glitches.  The FFmpeg AAC encoder has
had recent development, and is more than sufficient to be able to handle
the task of encoding in terms of both quality and performance, so it's
better just to use the FFmpeg encoder from here on out.

As this plugin is no longer needed, for the next year or two it'll still
be compiled and included, but as a blank plugin that does nothing.  The
reason why it's still being included as a blank no-operation plugin is
to overwrite older versions of the plugin.  That way if a user installs
a newer OBS version over an older one, it won't load up the older win-mf
plugin where the encoders still were enabled.

This also fixes some rarely reported media foundation crashes that can
happen on startup."

(This commit also modifies the obs-ffmpeg module)

The default channel layouts from aac spec are implemented in FFmpeg
native aac encoder as follows:

    AV_CH_LAYOUT_MONO,
    AV_CH_LAYOUT_STEREO,
    AV_CH_LAYOUT_SURROUND,
    AV_CH_LAYOUT_4POINT0,
    AV_CH_LAYOUT_5POINT0_BACK,
    AV_CH_LAYOUT_5POINT1_BACK,
    AV_CH_LAYOUT_7POINT1,

The correspondence of speaker layouts to AV_CH_LAYOUT from FFmpeg is
changed to reflect the previous table.

Although FFmpeg native aac encoder can now encode all the layouts listed
in avutil channel_layout.h (on master), there might be issues with older
FFmpeg binaries.

Note that 2.1 speaker layout will be encoded as AV_CH_LAYOUT_SURROUND
(FL FR FC) because it is not listed as the default layout for three
channels.

This just means some optimizations for LFE channel will not be used by
the encoder which will treat it as an SCE (single channel element).

Adds a source which tests whether audio buffering affects audio sync.
This sync test cycles through 7 audio/video frequencies at 250
millisecond intervals, and via a hotkey, will artificially move audio

This will artificially increase audio buffering by approximately 750
milliseconds.

audio buffering does not affect sync."

The list of channel layouts available for decklink input is missing 2.1

with the speaker layouts available at outputs.  Having different layouts
as input and output invokes FFmpeg resampler, which remixes the channels
in non trivial way except when downmixing to stereo.  This patch allows
to avoid such uncontrolled remix of channels with decklink input."

The core audio aac encoder has bitrates maps specific to speaker

(related bugs).
The ffmpeg constant AVFMT_RAWPICTURE was deprecated in october 2015
and marked for removal at avformat major bump to version 58
(ffmpeg commit 34ed5c2 , oct 12, 2015).
The bump occured with commit 69b5ce6 (oct21, 2017).
The constant was subsequently removed (commit 693a11b, oct 26 2017).
It was removed from obs-studio with commit d670d7b (from me).
But the code block which was executed with this constant was not
removed, causing issues with ffmpeg output.
The commit fixes the issue for old ffmpeg builds as well as new ones.
The constant is reintegrated for avformat major version < 58 and removed
for version >= 58 (along with its accompanying code).
Thanks to J Lowe for help in solving the bug.

Please note that this fix is currently only active for Elgato USB and
PCIe devices (e.g. Cam Link, HD60 S, HD60 Pro, 4K60 Pro) to avoid
unintentionally changing the behavior for any other devices (e.g.
webcams).

(Jim edit: This fixes an issue with newer Elgato devices where the
devices would not automatically have their audio coupled with the video;
users would have to manually select the audio device in order to get
audio functioning.)

Tested streaming servers: wowza, nginx
	 HLS, mpeg-dash : surround passthrough
Html5 players tested with live surround:
	 videojs, mediaelement, viblast (hls+dash), hls.js
Decklink: on win32, swap channels order for 5.1 7.1
         (due to different channel mapping on wav, mpeg, ffmpeg)
Audio filters: surround working.
Monitoring: surround working (win macOs linux (pulse-audio)).
VST:	 stereo plugins keep in general only the first two channels.
	 surround plugins should work (e.g. mcfx does).
OS: win, macOs, linux (alsa, pulse-audio).
Misc: larger audio bitrates unlocked to accommodate more channels

Use unbuffered async mode by default, and when in unbuffered mode,
decouple audio/video so that audio plays as soon as it's received.

This is a workaround for decklink device drivers having unreliable
video/audio timestamps (audio/video sync drifting over time).  From
testing, it seems that the handling of video and audio is completely
separate in the driver; along with the timestamp calculations.  For
example, when the thread of the decklink audio callback is stalled, it
would cause the timestamps of the audio alone to go out of sync, which
indicates timestamps are calculated more or less on the spot independent
of what video is doing (which is how we replicated the issue fixed by
b63e4b055e68a).  Because decklink drivers treats the audio and video as
essentially decoupled, we must also treat it as decoupled.  This is what
was causing video/audio to drift out of sync over time."

Decoupling the audio from the video causes the audio to be played right
when it's received rather than attempt to sync up to the video frames.
This is useful with certain async sources/devices when the audio/video
timestamps are not reliable.

Naturally because it plays audio right when it's received, this should
only be used when the async source is operating in unbuffered mode,
otherwise the video frame timing will be out of sync by the amount of
buffering the video currently has."

(This commit also modifies the obs-outputs module)

The first video packet video offset (the value used to set the starting
point of video data) would be set to the DTS value of the first video
packet.  However, when b-frames are used, the first DTS value will be
negative.  This was originally done because FLV muxing requires that the
first packet's DTS start from 0.  Unfortunately, this would also
effectively cause the first packet's PTS/DTS value to be shifted forward
by the negative amount, which would cause video sync to be off by a
video frame or two.

This fixes it to start at the PTS value instead and preserve any
negative offsets.  Additionally, the FLV muxing code has been fixed to
ensure that it adjusts the starting video DTS to 0, and now correctly
adjusts the first audio packet's timestamp according to that DTS as well
(which it didn't do before)."

With the newly released Driver 17.7.2, AMD fixed many reported issues and added some much wanted features:

- Pre-Pass and VBAQ are finally working,
- H265/HEVC content can distinguish between IDR- and I- Frames
- and also supports Color Range and Color Space now,
- and the 32-bit only text log crash was fixed.

And now it's time for the plugin to also be updated! This release primarily aims at adding support for AMF 1.4.4 and improving support for older drivers, with some of the recently discovered bugs and crashes fixed.

Hotfix 1: Fixed VBAQ and Pre-Pass being used with Constant QP, causing significant corruption issues and changed some default values for H265.

## Changelog
### 2.2.1
* Fixed a frame corruption bug with Constant QP caused by toggling VBAQ and Pre-Pass after it had already been applied.
* Changed the default value of 'Enforce HRD' to 'Enabled' for H265/HEVC encoding.
* Changed the default value of 'Deblocking Filter' to 'Disabled' for H265/HEVC encoding to fix corruption in strict decoders. (Premiere Pro, After Effects, Vegas, VLC (Software))

### 2.2.0
* Added support for AMF 1.4.4 and improved support for older drivers like 16.11.5 and 16.12.1.
* Fixed a memory corruption crash due to misuse of managed DirectX 11 objects.
* Fixed a frame corruption bug caused by applying 'VBAQ' and 'Pre-Pass' when using 'Constant QP' Rate Control Method.
* Fixed a string comparison bug causing Simple Output Mode to always use the Profile 'Constrained Baseline'
* Fixed a crash when enabling 'Debug' on 32-bit OBS caused by different type sizes.
* Fixed a crash with H265/HEVC caused by use of the undocumented Intra-Refresh properties.
* Changed the default value for 'Profile' to 'High'.
* Changed the default value for 'VBAQ' to 'Disabled' for improved performance.
* Changed the default value for 'Queue Size' to 8 for improved stability in spontaneous load situations.
* Changed the log crash work around to only apply to older AMF versions than 1.4.4.
* Removed unnecessary configuration changes.
* Removed unsupported Pre-Pass options 'Half Size' and 'Quarter Size'."

Scene items would incorrectly have pre-multiplied alpha when they were
scaled with different scale filtering, when they were cropped, or when
the item itself was a scene.  This happens because the scene renders the
items to a texture in those cases, and when they are rendered to a
texture the blend function would be the default srcalpha/invsrcalpha
blend function, which would cause alpha to become pre-multiplied in the
texture's result rather than straight alpha.

This changes the behavior to directly copy the color/alpha to the
texture using the one/zero blend function instead, which makes the
resulting texture straight alpha.  (Note that you do not want to turn
off the blend mode for the same result because certain sources can have
custom drawing that may rely on blending being available)

If size is 0 after popping data from the front or back, set the

pushes start from the beginning of the buffer rather than the middle of

Additionally, this fixes a bug with circulebuf_pop_back where if start
position was 0, and all the data was popped off the buffer (equal to the
capacity), the end position would be equal to the original size.  As an
example to replicate the bug, push 5, pop 5, then push 10.  The

be a not equal rather than an equal because you're not supposed to be
able to set a default value of one type on an item that already exists

This bug would make it so that if a particular setting was removed,
there would be no default value to fall back on, and it would always be

When hooking DXGI-based graphics programs in the hook, the first hook
point is IDXGISwapChain::Present.  To be able to initiate a capture, a
pointer to the device context that created the swap chain is required,
which can be retrieved via IDXGISwapChain::GetDevice.  Determining
whether the device context was D3D10 or D3D11 has always been somewhat
of an issue due to D3D10 and D3D11 being nearly identical, as well as
their interoperability/interchangeability.  The GetDevice function would
first be called with the UUID of ID3D10Device, then if that failed,
the UUID of ID3D11Device.

However, with certain specific D3D11 games, GetDevice would for some
unknown reason succeed with the UUID of ID3D10Device, which would cause
capture to fail.  (Conversely, attempting to call GetDevice with the
UUID of ID3D11Device on a device that's actually ID3D10Device would
always succeed, so reversing the order of the test was not an option).
There were originally three known D3D11 games that would erroneously
succeed when querying a D3D10 device interface:  Call of Duty: Ghosts,
Just Cause 3, and theHunter: Call of the Wild.  All other known D3D11
games would work correctly.  Because it was only these three games, a
hack was originally implemented in the form of an executable exception
list that would force them to capture D3D11.

Unfortunately, Oculus games are now failing under the same circumstance
as well, so a simple hack will no longer work.  To fix this, a more
reliable method of detecting which context it is had to be discovered:
simply check the feature level using ID3D11Device::GetFeatureLevel.  If
the feature level is D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0 or D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_1,
the device is definitely a D3D11 device.  Otherwise, continue the tests
as they were before.  Successfully tested with many D3D10 games, many
D3D11 games, and especially those three D3D11 games that previously were
detected as D3D10 erroneously."

Preloading is designed to overwrite the current internal render texture

keeps that current render texture visible, so preloading it with the

these should be considered workarounds. Included is the theme I was

Currently, when media-playback is used with a network address, video has

probably not wise because the first packet of video may contain

buffer while waiting for a keyframe, potentially causing a lot of audio
to get backed up unnecessarily which could inadvertently cause sync or
audio playback issues.

So, instead of waiting for a keyframe before decoding starts, decode
right away, and make it wait for a keyframe before calling the video

(This commit also modifies the decklink, linux-v4l2, mac-avcapture,
obs-ffmpeg, and win-dshow modules)

Originally, async buffering for sources was supposed to be a
user-controllable flag.  However, that turned out to be less than ideal
because sources (such as the win-dshow plugin) were programmed with
automatic control over their buffering (such as automatically detecting
USB 2.0 capture devices and then enabling in those cases).

The fact that it was a flag caused a design flaw to where buffering
values would be overwritten when a source is loaded from save data.

Because of that, this flag is being deprecated and replaced with a
specific function to enable unbuffered mode instead."

The reasoning behind this is because having a very large canvas size can
negatively affect the user experience -- most sources end up seeming
smaller than they need to be to users, resulting in the user needing to
size up the sources, or in the case of webcams it makes the user try to
use much larger webcam resolutions than they should reasonably need to
do, resulting in higher unintentional resource usage.  The program will
additionally require more fillrate to render and downscale things as
well.

This applies only to the default starting base/canvas resolution for new
users only.

Additionally, users that ran the program pre-19 will be unaffected by
this change, as it will detect that and set the old defaults to prevent
an unexpected change in resolution for those users."

The ""default"" preset is not an actual default, but something Nvidia
decided to just call that way.  It yields the worst quality per bitrate
out of all the presets, for no actual benefits.  The actual FFmpeg
default is the hq one, which yields the best quality, especially when
twopass mode is enabled.

I can't think of a way to keep the ""default"" preset in a non-confusing
way, and as it gives no known benefits, might as well just remove it
entirely.

(Jim edit: Also made it so that if the settings have it set to
""default"", it automatically treats it as ""hq"")

The LGP issue is caused by the device drivers returning two or more
packets in a single segment of audio data.  This fixes it by detecting
that and decoding subsequent packets.

When the FFmpeg audio decoder returns, it returns how many bytes of data
was decoded.  To have it decode multiple packets in a single segment,
just subtract the return value from the expected size, and if that size
is still larger than zero, then there are more packets in the segment to
decode.  Otherwise, stop."

This changes the logic to show all encoders in the Recording tab but
only show selected supported codecs in the Streaming tab (at least with
Advanced Output Mode).  The only (to my knowledge) streaming format that
supports other formats than H264 is WebRTC, which in theory should
support H264, VP8, VP9 and HEVC.  However I don't know about any ingest
server that works well with it yet.

In transitions, because the 'to' and 'from' are always rendered to
textures, the end result will always have premultiplied alpha.  This
would cause alpha to have blackish edges during transition, and cause
semi-transparent images to appear darker than they were supposed to.

To replicate, simply set the transparency of a source to 50%, then
transition between that scene and another scene.  The source will appear
to ""pop"" in and out unnaturally due to the premultiplied alpha effect of
the render targets.

To fix this, the solution is to simply convert premultiplied alpha to
straight alpha in the transition pixel shaders."

When the OBS signal is triggered for these widgets, the invokeMethod
could cause the thread to stall, which could make it wait much longer
than necessary to output audio data.  When that happens, it causes audio
monitoring to get backed up and get unnecessarily delayed, as well as
cause general audio buffering in libobs to increase unnecessarily.

A simple fix both in terms of preventing that stall and improving UI
performance is to not call invokeMethod to update the widget each time,
and then instead have those widgets update themselves via a timer at a
specific interval."

of the source, and then the reorder would signal the UI to resize the

This commit fixes a bug that would cause the frontend API function
obs_frontend_set_current_scene_collection to never be successful.  Due
to the bug, the following null pointer check would always fail, so the
action would never be triggered.

Modification by Jim: Instead of fixing the typo that caused this to
occur, make it so both scene collection menus and profile menus both use
""file_name"" consistently.

opened/created.  Before, there were functions that would first try to
open named objects and then implicitly create them if opening failed

The xcb message queue is not currently emptied.  If errors are generated
by any void requests the message queue will simply fill up and messages
will never be deleted.

Due to a (currently unknown) other problem this happens for me, and
results in OBS using up all memory with a queue that will never be
emptied.

Here we add a poll loop that will empty the xcb message queue and
discard the messages.  While this means that errors are still not
handled, OBS wont end up crashing either.

As reboot pointed out, it's assumed that the intention of a locked
preview is to prevent editing the scene. Because scrolling the preview
does not have any interaction with the scene and its sources, you should
be able to still scroll around and look at different parts of your
preview while the preview is locked.

There is also a bugfix included: previously, if you were to
right click while space bar was held down, you would be stuck in
scroll mode until spacebar is pressed/released again. This gets around
it by forcing scroll mode to end when a right click is issued on the
preview."

If an async source is cropped on one side, then when the program is
restarted and the source is loaded from file, the async source will
start out with a width/height of zero.  This will cause the async source
to not be drawn if cropping or scale filtering is added to the scene
item, because it has to be rendered to a texture first.  However, the
source cannot reset its size until it's drawn, so it leaves it in
perpetual state of having a 0x0 size.

This fixes that problem by ensuring that the async source size is always
reset even when not being rendered.

Adds preview scaling to the right-click context menu for the preview
pane.  This allows the ability to, for example, zoom the preview and
edit the preview 1:1 (canvas/base resolution).  This was a missing
parity feature.  Additionally, also allows scaling to the
""output/scaled"" resolution the program is set to.

When the preview is in scale mode and is the focused widget, you can
hold space and drag with left click to change the zoomed position.

Due to an NVIDIA driver bug with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update,
there are an increasingly large number of reports of ""Device Removed""
errors and TDRs.  When this happens, OBS stops outputting all data
because all graphics functions are failing, and it appears to just
""freeze up"" for users.

To temporarily alleviate this issue while waiting for it to be fixed,
the D3D subsystem can be rebuilt when that happens, all assets can be
reloaded to ensure that it can continue functioning (with a minor hiccup
in playback).

To allow rebuilding the entire D3D subsystem, all objects that contain
D3D references must be part of a linked list (with a few exceptions) so
we can quickly traverse them all whenever needed, and all data for those
resources (static resources primarily, such as shaders, textures, index
buffers, vertex buffers) must be stored in RAM so they can be recreated
whenever needed.

Then if D3D reports a ""device removed"" or ""device reset"" error, all D3D
references must first be fully released with no stray references; the
linked list must be fully traversed until all references are released.
Then, the linked list must once again be traversed again, and all those
D3D objects must be recreated with the same data and descriptors (which
are now saved in each object).  Finally, all states need to be reset.

After that's complete, the device is able to continue functioning almost
as it was before, although the output to recording/stream may get a few
green frames due to texture data being reset.

This will temporarily alleviate the ""Device Removed"" issue while waiting
for a fix from NVIDIA."

The noise suppression filter mistakenly operated on the assumption that
input audio data would always be in 10ms segments, and would crash if
audio data was larger than that size.

Because speexdsp operates on fixed audio frame sizes only, we must
buffer audio data to fit that frame processing size.  This creates a
troublesome situation where you must buffer around that specified frame
size.

The new steps for processing are:
1. Push audio data to input circular buffer.
2. Push number of audio frames and timestamp for that audio packet to an
   'info' circular buffer.
3. Check size of input circular buffer, and while it's equal to or above
   the speexdsp frame size (10ms for minimum latency), pop from the
   input buffer to a temporary buffer (10ms frames) and process it, then
   push that temporary buffer to the output circular buffer.
4. Peek at the front of the 'info' circular buffer.
5. If the output circular buffer frame size is equal or larger than next
   expected number of frames, pop both the info and output buffer, and
   return the audio data with the expected audio frames/timestamp."

This fixes the long-time design flaw where obs_output_stop and the
output 'stop' callback would just shut down the output without
considering the timing of when obs_output_stop was used, discarding any
possible buffering and causing the output to get cut off at an
unexpected timing.

The 'stop' callback of obs_output_info now takes a timestamp with the
expectation that the output will use that timestamp to stop output data
in accordance to that timing.  obs_output_stop now records the timestamp
at the time that the function is called and calls the 'stop' callback
with that timestamp.  If needed, obs_output_force_stop will still stop
the output immediately without buffering."

playlists yet.

If VLC is installed on the computer (with the same architecture) it will
allow video playback via libVLC.  In the future, users should be able to
optionally download VLC libraries via the installer as well if they
don't want to necessarily install VLC to get the plugin working.

This plugin performs runtime linking instead of compile-time linking;
compiling VLC is not required, only its headers are required.  To
compile, clone the VLC repository and set the VLCPath cmake variable to

The xcomposite window capture crashes were due to a few factors:
-------------------------------
1.) The source's X error handler was possibly being overwritten by
another part of the program despite us locking the display, presumably
something in Qt which isn't locking the display when pushing/popping its
own error handler (though this is not yet certain).  The source's calls
to X functions happen in the graphics thread, which is separate from the
UI thread, and it was noticed that somehow the error handler would be
overwritten almost seemingly at random, indicating that something else
in the program outside of OBS code was not locking the display while
pushing/popping the error handler.

To replicate this, make it so that the source cannot find the target
window and so it continually searches for it each video_tick call, then
resize the main OBS window continually (which causes Qt to push/pop its
own error handlers).  A crash will almost always occur due to BadWindow
despite our error handling.

2.) Calling X functions with a window ID that no longer exists,
particularly XGetWindowAttributes, in conjunction the unknown error
handler set in case #1 would cause the program to outright crash because
that error handler is programmed to crash on BadWindow for whatever
reason.  The source would call X functions without even checking if
'win' was 0.

3.) The source stored window IDs (in JSON, even if they've long since
become invalid/pointless, such as system restarts).  This is a bad
practice and will result in more cases of BadWindow.

Fixing the problem (reducing the possibility of getting BadWindow):
-------------------------------
Step 1.) Deprecate and ignore window IDs in stored settings.  Instead of
using window IDs to find the window, we now must always search the
windows and find the target window via the window name exclusively.
This helps ensure that we actually consistently have a working window
ID.

Step 2.) Do not call any X functions if the window ID is 0.

Step 3.) Reset the window ID to 0 any time the window has updated, and
make the source find the window again to ensure it still exists before
attempting to use any X functions on the window ID again."

This reverts commit 8d520b970d3552417005f6dab4f0892485cd14ce.

This can actually cause a hard lock due to the windows API when
destroying window capture.  When the graphics thread locks the source
list for doing tick or render, and then the UI thread tries to destroy a
source, the UI thread will wait for the graphics thread to complete
rendering/ticking of sources.  The video_tick of window capture would
then check windows in the same process and try to query the window's
name via GetWindowText.  However, GetWindowText is synchronous, and will
not return until the window event has been processed by the UI thread,
so it will perpetually lock because the two threads are waiting for each
other to finish."

This patch fixes a specific crash where if the user named a filter the

item loading code could find the filter with the same name instead of
the source, and mistakenly use it as the scene item's source directly.
This would cause a crash when trying to render that filter as a regular
source.

Marking filters as private is a temporary and simple workaround to the
solution.  Filters are currently not meant to be found via the main
enumeration/search functions, which is a design flaw (lack of
consistency).  In future major API revisions of libobs, filters should
be reworked to act as sources, with the sources they filter as
sub-sources ideally.

Additionally, the concept of ""private context objects"" and ""primary
lists of context objects"" in the back-end should probably also be
removed, allowing the font-end (or optional separate API layers) to
control all primary lists of obs context objects.  These minor issues
that occur ultimately stem from API design flaws which need to be
corrected."

Adds deinterlacing API functions.  Both standard and 2x variants are
supported.  Deinterlacing is set via obs_source_set_deinterlace_mode and
obs_source_set_deinterlace_field_order.

This was implemented in to the core itself because deinterlacing should
happen before effect filters are processed, but after async filters are
processed.  If this were added as a filter, there is the possibility
that a different filter is processed before deinterlacing, which could
mess with the result.  It was also a bit easier to implement this way
due to the fact that that deinterlacing may need to have access to the
previous async frame.

Effects were split in to separate files to reduce load time (especially
for yadif shaders which take a significant amount of time to compile)."

To:
-------------------
void obs_load_sources(obs_data_array_t *sources_list,
		obs_source_load_cb callback, void *private_data);

Signals should really never be required to use to make some function
work properly.  The ""source_load"" signal was required for the
obs_load_sources function, but it's meant more for loading private data
in the settings, not for general loading of sources.

This changes it so that a callback is explicitly required to load the
sources."

Under certain circumstances, the timing_adjust variable would cause line
1161 to continually trigger over and over again.  The ""loop detection""
code incorrectly made it so that any timestamp that was just simply
below the expected value would be seen as a jump.  After that, the
timing_adjust variable would be set for the frame again, and then the
audio would see it as a jump again after that, and those two things
would continue endlessly.  This would cause stuttering particularly with
certain devices (particularly elgato/lgp/hdpvr) where the audio/video
data are decoded and sent at varying/different/unpredictable times.

To fix this issue, it should not detect values below as jumps, but
instead should only do it for values that exceed the MAX_TS_VAR (maximum

With the new audio subsystem, audio buffering is minimal at all times.
However, when the audio buffering is too small or non-existent, it would
cause the audio encoders to start with a timestamp that was actually
higher than the first video frame timestamp.  Video would have some
inherent buffering/delay, but then audio could return and encode almost
immediately.  This created a possible window of empty time between the
first encoded video packet and the first encoded audio packet, where as
audio buffering would cause the first audio packet's timestamp to always
be way before the first video packet's timestamp.  It would then
incorrectly assume the two starting points were in sync.

So instead of assuming the audio data is always first, this patch makes
video wait for audio data comes in, and conversely buffers audio data
until video comes in, and tries to find a starting point within that
video data instead, ensuring a synced starting point whether audio
buffering is active or not."

When using multi-track audio, encoders cannot be paired like they can
when only using a single audio track with video, so it has to choose the
best point in the interleaved buffer as the ""starting point"", and if the
encoders start up at different times, it has to prune that data and wait
to start the output on the next video keyframe.  When the audio encoders
started up, there was the case where the encoders would take some time
to load, and it would cause the pruning code to wait for the next

  - The ability to set up ""quick transitions"" with a desired transition
    and duration that can be assigned hotkeys

  - The option to create full copies of all sources in the program scene

  - Swap Mode (enabled by default) which swaps the program scene with
    the preview scene when a transition completes

Currently, only non-configurable transitions (transitions without
properties) are listed, and the only transitions available as of this
writing are fade and cut.  In future versions more transitions will be
added, such as swipe, stingers, and many other various sort of

This fixes an age-old issue where audio samples could be lost or audio
could temporarily go out of sync in the case of looping videos.  When
audio/video data is looping, there's a window between when the audio
data resets its timestamp value and when the video data resets its
timestamp value.  This method simply pushes back the audio data while in
that window and does not modify sync, and when it detects that its out
of the loop window it simply forces a resync of the audio data in the
circular buffer.

This ensures that minimal audio data is lost in the loop process, and
minimizes the likelihood of any sort of sync issues associated with
looping."

Transition sources are implemented by registering a source type as
OBS_SOURCE_TYPE_TRANSITION.  They're automatically marked as video
composite sources, and video_render/audio_render callbacks must be set
when registering the source.  get_width and get_height callbacks are
unused for these types of sources, as transitions automatically handle
width/height behind the scenes with the transition settings.

In the video_render callback, the helper function
obs_transition_video_render is used to assist in automatically
processing and rendering the audio.  A render callback is passed to the
function, which in turn passes to/from textures that are automatically
rendered in the back-end.

Similarly, in the audio_render callback, the helper function
obs_transition_audio_render is used to assist in automatically
processing and rendering the audio.  Two mix callbacks are used to
handle how the source/destination sources are mixed together.  To ensure
the best possible quality, audio processing is per-sample.

Transitions can be set to automatically resize, or they can be set to
have a fixed size.  Sources within transitions can be made to scale to
the transition size (with or without aspect ratio), or to not scale
unless they're bigger than the transition.  They can have a specific
alignment within the transition, or they just default to top-left.
These features are implemented for the purpose of extending transitions
to also act as ""switch"" sources later, where you can switch to/from two
different sources using the transition animation.

Planned (but not yet implemented and lower priority) features:

- ""Switch"" transitions which allow the ability to switch back and forth
  between two sources with a transitioning animation without discarding
  the references

- Easing options to allow the option to transition with a bezier or
  custom curve

- Manual transitioning to allow the front-end/user to manually control
  the transition offset"

The new audio subsystem fixes two issues:

- First Primary issue it fixes is the ability for parent sources to
  intercept the audio of child sources, and do custom processing on
  them.  The main reason for this was the ability to do custom
  cross-fading in transitions, but it's also useful for things such as
  side-chain effects, applying audio effects to entire scenes, applying
  scene-specific audio filters on sub-sources, and other such
  possibilities.

- The secondary issue that needed fixing was audio buffering.
  Previously, audio buffering was always a fixed buffer size, so it
  would always have exactly a certain number of milliseconds of audio
  buffering (and thus output delay).  Instead, it now dynamically
  increases audio buffering only as necessary, minimizing output delay,
  and removing the need for users to have to worry about an audio
  buffering setting.

The new design makes it so that audio from the leaves of the scene graph
flow to the root nodes, and can be intercepted by parent sources.  Each
audio source handles its own buffering, and each audio tick a specific
number of audio frames are popped from the front of the circular buffer
on each audio source.  Composite sources (such as scenes) can access the
audio for child sources and do custom processing or mixing on that
audio.  Composite sources use the audio_render callback of sources to do
synchronous or deferred audio processing per audio tick.  Things like
scenes now mix audio from their sub-sources."

Darkest dungeon uses an unusual technique for drawing its frames: a
fixed 1920x1080 frame buffer used in place of the backbuffer, which is
then stretched to fit the size of the screen (whether the screen is
bigger or smaller than the actual texture).

The custom frame would cause glReadBuffer to initially fail with an
error.  When this happens, their custom frame buffer is in use, so all
that needs to be done is simply reset the capture and force the current
output size to 1920x1080 while that custom frame is in use.

They presumably did this in order to ensure the game looks the same at
any resolution.  Instead of having to use power-of-two sprites and
mipmaps for every single game sprite and stretch/skew each of them

OSX has an annoying feature called ""BeamSync"", which on later versions
of OSX is always on.  For whatever reason, Apple devs decided to force
this feature to always be on, so applications must always render with

This issue would cause syncing to the vertical refresh for each
additional active display, and wouldn't allow rendering above the
current refresh rate.  This caused major rendering stalls and prevented
video frame timing from being accurate.

This fixes the issue by using an undocumented set of functions to
disable BeamSync.  Note that because this is an undocumented method of
working around the issue, its existence cannot be guaranteed.  If the

Problem:

When an output is started with encoders that have already been started
by another output, and it starts in between the window in between where
the first audio packets start coming in and where the first video packet
comes in, the output would get audio packets with timestamps potentially
much later than the first video frame when the first video frame finally
comes in.  The audio/video encoders will almost always have a differing
delay.

Solution:

Detect that starting window, and if within that starting window, wait
for a new keyframe from video instead of trying to sync up video.

Additional Notes:

In these cases where an output starts with already-active encoders, this
patch also reduces the potential sync offset between the first video
frame and the first audio frame.  Before, it would sync the first video
frame with the first audio frames right after that, but now it syncs
with the closest audio frame in the interleaved array, which halves the
potential sync difference between the first video frame and the first
audio frame of already-active encoders.  (So now the potential sync
difference is roughly 11.6 milliseconds at 44.1khz audio, where it was
23.2 before)"

Currently creating new sources can cause a deadlock:
OBSBasicSourceSelect locks the scene mutex when adding a new source
(required to add invisible sources), and later OBSBasic tries to
lock the graphics mutex (via CreatePropertiesWindow); meanwhile the
graphics thread is holding the graphics mutex and tries to lock each
scene as it renders them, resulting in a (non-obvious from the code)
lock ordering conflict.

Moving the CreatePropertiesWindow call out of the locked scene mutex
restores the previous lock ordering; in addition, the requirement
for keeping sourceSceneRefs for opening that initial properties
window is removed"

When an async video source is about to be rendered, the async texture
should be updated before any effect filtering occurs, rather than right
when it's about to render.

Fixes a few bugs:

- If the async texture hadn't drawn for its first time, and the source
  has an effect filter, it would never end up rendering the first
  frame due to the fact that it would fail on obs-source.c:2434 for the
  first filter, causing it to never actually render the source, and thus
  never get to a point in which it could call set_async_texture_size to
  establish the async texture width/height for the first time.

- Any time the async texture size changed, it would only update the
  async texture size at the end of the filter loop, which means that the
  first frame after a size change would use the old size for the filters
  rather than update to the new size right away."

So certain high-profile individuals were complaining that it was
difficult to configure recording settings for quality in OBS.  So, I
decided to add a very easy-to-use auto-configuration for high quality
encoding -- including lossless encoding.  This feature will
automatically configure ideal recording settings based upon a specified
quality level.

Recording quality presets added to simple output:

- Same as stream: Copies the encoded streaming data with no extra usage
  hit.

- High quality: uses a higher CRF value (starting at 23) if using x264.

- Indistinguishable quality: uses a low CRF value (starting at 16) if
  using x264.

- Lossless will spawn an FFmpeg output that uses huffyuv encoding.  If a
  user tries to select lossless, they will be warned both via a dialog
  prompt and a warning message in the settings window to ensure they
  understand that it requires tremendous amounts of free space.  It will
  always use the AVI file format.

Extra Notes:

- When High/Indistinguishable quality is set, it will allow you to
  select the recording encoder.  Currently, it just allows you to select
  x264 (at either veryfast or ultrafast).  Later on, it'll be useful to
  be able to set up pre-configured presets for hardware encoders once
  more are implemented and tested.

- I decided to allow the use of x264 at both veryfast or ultrafast
  presets.  The reasoning is two-fold:

  1.) ultrafast is perfectly viable even for near indistinguishable
quality as long as it has the appropriate CRF value.  It's nice if you
want to record but would like to or need to reduce the impact of
encoding on the CPU.  It will automatically compensate for the preset at
the cost of larger file size.

  2.) It was suggested to just always use ultrafast, but ultrafast
requires 2-4x as much disk space for the same CRF (most likely due to
x264 compensating for the preset).  Providing veryfast is important if
you really want to reduce file size and/or reduce blocking at lower
quality levels.

- When a recording preset is used, a secondary audio encoder is also
  spawned at 192 bitrate to ensure high quality audio.  I chose 192
  because that's the limit of the media foundation aac encoder on
  windows, which I want to make sure is used if available due to its
  high performance.

- The CRF calculation is based upon resolution, quality, and whether
  it's set to ultrafast.  First, quality sets the base CRF, 23 for
  ""good"" quality, 16 for ""very high"" quality.  If set to ultrafast,
  it'll subtract 2 points from the CRF value to help compensate.  Lower
  resolutions will also lower the CRF value to help improve higher
  details with a smaller pixel ratio."

After making it wait on those events by calling DrainEvents(true), the

leading to a crash."

changed in to a menu button, which allows the user to select either the
option to stop the stream (which causes it to count down), or forcibly
stop the stream (which immediately stops the stream and cuts off all
delayed data).

If the user decides they want to start the stream again while in the
process of counting down, they can safely do so without having to wait
for it to stop, and it will schedule it to start up again with the same
delay after the stop.

On the status bar, it will now show whether delay is active, and its
duration.  If the stream is in the process of stopping/starting, it will
count down to the stop/start.

If the option to preserve stream cutoff point on unexpected
disconnections/reconnections is enabled, it will update the current
delay duration accordingly."

This feature allows a user to delay an output (as long as the output
itself supports it).  Needless to say this intended for live streams,
where users may want to delay their streams to prevent stream sniping,
cheating, and other such things.

The design this time was a bit more elaborate, but still simple in
design:  the user can now schedule stops/starts without having to wait
for the stream itself to stop before being able to take any action.
Optionally, they can also forcibly stop stream (and delay) in case
something happens which they might not want to be streamed.

Additionally, a new option was added to preserve stream cutoff point on
disconnections/reconnections, so that if you get disconnected while
streaming, when it reconnects, it will reconnect right at the point
where it left off.  This will probably be quite useful for a number of
applications in addition to regular delay, such as setting the delay to
1 second and then using this feature to minimize, for example, a
critical stream such as a tournament stream from getting any of its
stream data cut off.  However, using this feature will of course cause
the stream data to buffer and increase delay (and memory usage) while
it's in the process of reconnecting."

This allows plugins to update and cache data files from a remote source.

Here are the steps that occur when the API initiates an update check:

1.) It checks to see if the local files are greater than the cached
    files.  If the local version is newer (for whatever reason), it
    replaces the cached version(s) with the local version.

2.) A packages.json file is downloaded from the specified URL.  That
    packages.json file contains a version number and a list of files to
    be updated.

3.) If the downloaded package version is greater than the cached
    version, executes step 4-5 on each file.

4.) Checks the version for the file to update in packages.json, and if
    the version is greater than the cached version, proceeds to step 5,
    otherwise repeat step 4-5 for other files.

5.) Calls the callback given to the update function (if any) with the
    file information (file name, buffer, etc), and if the callback
    returns true, allows the cached file to be updated and replaced,
    otherwise goes back to step 4-6 for the rest of the files.

NOTE: Files are never modified directly.  All file saving/modification
is performed in a temporary directory, and then files are moved to their
destination.  This should eliminate any possibility of file corruption
(or at least dramatically reduce the possibility)."

To:
- bool obs_startup(const char *locale, const char *module_config_path,
		profiler_name_store_t *store);

Summary:
---------------------------
This allows plugin modules to store plugin-specific configuration data
(rather than only allowing objects to store configuration data).  This
will be useful for things like caching data, for example looking up and
storing ingests from remote (rather than storing locally), or caching
font data (so it doesn't have to build a font cache each time), among
other things.

Also adds a module-specific directory for the UI"

extension is also automatically retrieved from libff depending on the

I made the rather tough call of not showing all services by default; I
didn't want to have to do this, but too many services are asking to be
put in to the program, and any time I add a service in to the list, I
feel uncomfortable because I feel like I'm potentially advertising them,
and/or they're using our program to advertise as well.  Some of these
services are particularly bad at policing illegal/copyrighted content,
host content that I personally find distasteful or incredibly stupid
(what the heck is up with these ""vaping"" streams?), or are just fairly
terrible websites in general that I just feel uncomfortable with showing
by default.

However, I do not really want to reject anyone either, I want to let
their users be able to use our program with relative ease, but more than
anything I just simple don't want to be seen as ""endorsing"" some of
these websites (more than others in particular).  I know that a ""show
all services"" checkbox is probably pretty pointless/superfluous thing to
do, but I feel like it's at the very least a means of saying ""hey, I
don't really endorse these guys,"" or ""use at your own risk,"" or
""warning: this website is incredibly terrible.""

Honestly, I couldn't really think of any better solution that would
 a.) still list all services without outright censoring them, and
 b.) prevent us from being seen as ""endorsing"" all services.

(Although maybe this whole thing feels a bit.. passive aggressive.  I
feel like I'm tipping over someone's garden gnome in the middle of the
night while they're sleeping.  Still, it's something.)

NOTE: This code is backward compatible; i.e., if you previously had a
service selected that's not common but don't have the ""show all""
checkbox checked, it'll still show that service for convenience."

API Changed (obs.h):
-----------------------------------------
- Removed member variables from struct obs_video_info:
  - window_width
  - window_height
  - window

- Removed functions:
  - obs_add_draw_callback
  - obs_remove_draw_callback
  - obs_resize
  - obs_preview_set_enabled
  - obs_preview_enabled

API Changed (graphics/graphics.h)
-----------------------------------------
- Changed third parameter of gs_create from
     const struct gs_init_data *data
  to
     uint32_t adapter

Summary
-----------------------------------------
Changing to a windowless context allows the ability to use libobs
without needing to have it depend on an open window/view, and removes
superfluous functionality that's already provided by the obs_display
functions.

Biggest benefits of windowless context:
- Make it so all window/view related code uses obs_display (which is a
  major refactor/prune)
- Allows core functions to not have to be dependent upon an existing
  window/view
- Allow the ability to make a fully CLI front end that doesn't depend on
  a window
- Allows the ability to a hypothetical CLI from a remote

Because of the API changes, multiple modules are affected by this commit
to prevent creating broken commits: libobs, libobs-opengl, libobs-d3d11,
and the UI.

In the libobs back-end, all preview/window API functions that are not
related to obs_display have been removed, and to draw on a window/view
you must now always create an obs_display (rather than having ""main""
display functions and then ""secondary"" display functions that use
obs_display).

For the technicalities of the graphics back-end, the gs_init function
now only takes in an adapter parameter instead of window/format/etc
information.  To draw on a window/view you must now always create a swap
chain for it (note that obs_display wraps this functionality).

As for the UI, the UI has been refactored so that all dialogs/windows
that have a preview do not have to manually create OBSDisplay objects;
the OBSQTDisplay class now automatically handles all the code related to
displays.  The main window preview now also relies on that same
functionality/code."

This makes it so that OBSQTDisplay now uses/controls an obs_display
object directly (rather than having the owner have to associate an
OBSDisplay with it).  It was separated before because the main window
for the basic UI would was using the ""main preview"" stuff before the
windowless context and had to be handled differently, so you couldn't
just associate an obs_display object with OBSQTDisplay, meaning that all
""secondary"" previews such as properties/filters/etc had to handle the
obs_display alone, which caused a lot of needlessly duplicated code.

Also adds a DisplayCreated signal to allow owners to be able to add
callbacks and such on creation of the actual obs_display context."

---------------------
Changes the core libobs API to not be dependent upon a main window/view.
If you wish to draw to a window/view, use an obs_display object to
handle it.

This allows the use of libobs without requiring a window to be present
on the system.  This is also prunes code that had to be needlessly

SaveProject calls obs functions that locks certain mutexes, and because
I made it so that SaveProject was being called inside of certain signal
handlers (which could already be locked in other mutexes), it could
cause a mutual deadlock with other threads.

This fix puts the main project saving code in to SaveProjectDeferred,
then pushes it on to the Qt message queue to safely save outside of
those locks.  It's a function that's perfectly safe to put on the
message queue because it will automatically be disabled in certain
circumstances where it would be unsafe to call, such as on shutdown.

This code will also make it so that the project will not needlessly be
saved more than once if the SaveProjectDeferred call was pushed multiple

This particularly affected audio encoding, audio encoding previously

because I was using a standard integer (which is 32bit by default on

hours of samples at 48000 sample rate.  After that, it would start going
into negative territory (overflowing).  By changing it to int64_t, it
will make it so that audio at 48000 samples per second would only be

When hooking 64bit functions, sometimes the offset between the function
being hooked and the hook itself can be large enough to where it
requires a 64bit offset to be used.  However, because a 64bit jump
requires overwriting so many code instructions in the function, it can
sometimes overwrite code in to an adjacent function, thereby causing a
crash.

The 64bit hook bounce (created by R1CH) is designed to prevent using
very long jumps in the target by creating executable memory within a
32bit offset of that target, and then writing it with the 64bit long
jump instruction instead.  Then in the target function, it will jump to
that memory instead, thus forcing the actual hooked function to use a
32bit hook instead of a 64bit hook, and using at most 5 bytes for the
actual hook, preventing any likelihood of it overwriting an adjacent
function."

Apparently some raw lingering pointers to the item widgets may be
present inside of the QListView if you delete the item widgets directly,
and the only way to ensure those pointers are properly cleared is to
call ->clear() on the list widget instead of deleting each item
individually.

We were deleting each item individually because we thought that
->deleteLater might be also be called on other data within, but after
some testing, that turned out to not be the case, so it's safe to call
->clear() on the list widget.

As a note, deleting item widgets directly is dangerous due to the
potential for lingering raw internal pointers, and our case is unique
where we can get away with it; do not delete list item widgets directly
unless you intend on calling ->clear() or ->takeItem on the specific
item you do it to after.

Again, the reason why we are deleting list widget items manually is due
to the fact that Qt will always use ->deleteLater() on them if they are
not deleted manually, which puts their deletion on the queue.  Only
problem is they cannot be removed from the queue once added, so
lingering references to sources will persist until the queue processes
them, which causes major problems if we need those objects deleted right
away."

It doesn't seem like a full implementation of the stream operators would be
useful since the signal registration is very specific to the interaction
between the scenes and sources list, i.e. in case the scenes list ever accepts
scenes from sources (not 'obs_source's) other than itself (non InternalMove
drag&drop?) it would have to register those scenes with the libobs core which

Due to the fact that async timestamps themselves can be susceptible to
minor jitter from certain types of inputs, increase the allowable jitter
compensation value to ensure that the rendered frame timing from async
video sources is always as close as possible to the compositor.

compositor, this (combined with the fact that clamped video timing now
being used with async video frames) helps ensure that buffered async
video sources will sync up their rendering to the compositor as
accurately as possible despite jitter from the source's timestamps.

If there is no jitter in the source's timestamps then it'll always sync
up perfectly with the compositor, thanks to clamped video timing."

When buffering is enabled for an async video source, sometimes minor
drift in timestamps or unexpected delays to frames can cause frames to
slowly buffer more and more in memory, in some cases eventually causing
the system to run out of memory.

The circumstances in which this can happen seems to depend on both the
computer and the devices in use.  So far, the only known circumstances
in which this happens are with heavily buffered devices, such as
hauppauge, where decoding can sometimes take too long and cause
continual frame playback delay, and thus continual buffering until
memory runs out.  I've never been able to replicate it on any of my
machines however, even after hours of testing.

This patch is a precautionary measure that puts a hard limit on the
number of async frames that can be currently queued to prevent any case
where memory might continually build for whatever reason.  If it goes
over the limit, it clears the cache to reset the buffering.

I had a user with this problem test this patch with success and positive
feedback, and the intervals between buffering resets were long to where
it wasn't even noticeable while streaming/recording.

Ideally when decoding frames (such as from those devices), frame
dropping should be used to ensure playback doesn't incur extra delay,
although this sort of hard limit on the frame cache should still be
implemented regardless just as a safety precaution.  For DirectShow
encoded devices I should just switch to faruton's libff for decoding and
enable the frame dropping options.  It would probably explain why no
one's ever reported it for the media source, and pretty much only from
DirectShow device usage."

The Qt5Network classes seem to only support OpenSSL, and because OpenSSL
isn't available on windows, we would have to distribute it with the
program to get SSL access working.  The problem with that is that
OpenSSL is not GPL-compatible, so we cannot distribute OpenSSL with the
program, which means we have to find a better (and preferably superior)
library for accessing remote files that can use the windows SSPI for our
SSL needs, which comes with the operating system.

Fortunately, libcurl is probably the best library out there, and can be
compiled with SSPI instead of OpenSSL, so we're just going to switch to
libcurl instead.  Originally I thought it didn't support SSPI, otherwise
I would have implemented it sooner.

As a side note, this will make it so we'll able to get files from the
internet via plugins, which will be quite useful."

This allows using NV12, I420, or RGB output video formats.  This option
will set what obs itself outputs frames as.

It's important to note that this is only ideal for specific FFmpeg
encoders that support the desired video format; for example, if you use
RGB and use the huffyuv encoder, huffyuv will now properly output in RGB
instead of YUV NV12/I420.

I420 is useful for eliminating the NV12->I420 conversion for the
AVerMedia encoders, as AVerMedia encoders only support I420 input.

A second even more important note about RGB is that if the encoder does
not support the format you are using, it will be converted on the CPU to
a format that the encoder supports as it's encoded; so for example
setting the obs output format to RGB and then using x264 will be futile
and end up using needless amounts of extra CPU than if you just had obs
set to NV12, which is the most common and ideal format for x264.

In the future, native output of other YUV formats might be implemented
(such as YUV 4:2:2)."

want to be able to view the source in a projector or source properties

My original line of thinking was that they can just use a transform to
flip the image, but I felt this problem impacts rendering everywhere,
such as in the projector and in the source properties, so having it as
an option in the source itself feels like the best way to ensure that a

The obs_source::async_reset_texture variable can cause a data race
between threads to occur because it could be set to true in one thread
then changed back to false in another thread.  This could cause the
async texture to not update its size when it's supposed to, which can
cause a crash or corruption when copying data from a frame of a
differing size.

The solution to this is to:

- Delete the async_reset_texture variable, and make the
  set_async_texture_size function change the texture size if the
  async_width, async_height, or async_format variables differ from the
  frame's width/height/format.  Those variables are then only ever set
  in the libobs graphics thread.

- Make the cache_video function use separate variables from other
  functions to detect a change in size (due to the fact that the texture
  size should only be resized in the libobs graphics thread).  These
  variables are async_cache_width, async_cache_height, and
  async_cache_format, which are only be set in the thread that calls
  obs_source_output_video.

How to replicate the data race:

- On OSX, use window capture on a textedit window, then continually
  resize the textedit window."

The minimum and maximum color range values were not being set by the

assume it's because the expected min/max values of full range is
{0.0, 0.0, 0.0} and {1.0, 1.0, 1.0}, so I'm just making it so that it
sets those values if using full range.

Way to replicate the issue (windows):
1.) Create a win-dshow device capture source
2.) Select a device and set it to a YUV color format to enable YUV color
conversion
3.) Select ""Full Range"" in the color range property.
4.) Restart OBS, the device will then start up, but will display green
due to the fact that the min/max range values were never set, and are
left at their default value of 0."

Due to a bad 'if' expression, when a filter that is not last in the

This fix makes sure that it only calls the appropriate render functions
if the next filter target is the source, otherwise it will just call
obs_source_video_render to process the next filter in the chain.

How to replicate the bug:
1. Create two crop filters on the same source
2. Give each crop filter a different distinct value
3. Disable both crop filters
4. The image would still be cropped"

Async frames are only swapping when rendering, or when not visible.
This is a flawed design due to the fact that there are certain
circumstances where the source is neither visible nor currently
rendering.

This is what caused a memory leak when scene items were marked as
invisible, because if a source has an async child source and decides not
to render that source for whatever reason, the child source would not
process the async frames at all, and the cache would just grow.

To fix this, simply moving the async frame cycle to tick fixes the issue
due to the fact that tick is always called regardless of circumstance."

be fine if you're not rendering any filters, but filters will render to

By default, video plays back based upon the timestamp for each frame,
and buffers the frames as needed to ensure that they play back at the
expected timing.

However, this can add some minor additional delay to the video, and may
not be ideal for certain devices such as webcams and generally any
device that has minimal latency.  However, because those are the only
type of devices that typically have drivers, there's no real need to
have it on by default.

This adds an option to use buffering, and leaves it off by default.

Remove the ""Leave Unchanged"" option for the input and video format
select.

This option was primarily added for cases in which the
resolution and framerate are set by another program or the capture
device itself and the values are not directly supported by the plugin.
One major usecase here would be capture devices for tv signals which
might be set to a spcific resolution and refresh rate, and might fail
to initialize in case any other combination of those settings is forced.

In case of the input this option did not make much sense, as the first
input is probably the best default option in most cases.

For the video format this default is even bad in some cases. If an
format emulated by libv4l2 is selected for example, this will usually
configure the device to use mjpeg with libv4l2 converting it to some
format obs can use. When obs or the source is then restarted and the
""Leave Unchanged"" is enabled the plugin will fail, because it will only
notice that the device is set to mjpeg, without any knowledge about the
possibility of letting libv4l2 handle the conversion.

Using the first available and supported format is not nescessarily the
best choice, but still preferable to some random format that will
cause the plugin to not capture at all. Forcing a choice here will
hopefully also make the plugin behaviour more predicatable for the user."

I had this issue where IDXGISwapChain::ResizeBuffers would fail in the
hooks, causing games to crash when they resized their backbuffers
because ResizeBuffers would return an 'invalid call' HRESULT value.  In
the ResizeBuffers documentation it says that it will only happen if a
backbuffer currently has any outstanding references, but there's no way
this would happen unless ResizeBuffers internally calls Present or vise
versa.

After ResizeBuffers has been called, the very first call to Present will
somehow seemingly invalidate and/or destroy the current backbuffer.
It's very strange, but that seems to be what's going on, at least for
the game I was testing.  So if you are performing a post-overlay
capture, then you must ignore the capture on the very first call to
Present.

It's Microsoft's code so you can't really know what's going on, you just
have to work around these strange issues seemingly in the dark."

When using multiple video encoders together with a single audio encoder,
the audio wouldn't be in sync.

The reason why this occurred is because the dts_usec variable of the
encoder packet (which is based on system time) would always be reset to
a value based upon the dts (which is not guaranteed to be based on
system time) in the apply_interleaved_packet_offset function.  This
would then in turn cause it to miscalculate the starting audio/video
offsets, which are required to calculate sync.

So instead of calling that function unnecessarily, separate the check
for whether audio/video has been received in to a new function, and only
start applying the interleaved offsets after audio and video have
actually started up and the starting offsets have been calculated."

  example allow a user to stream the game/mic audio but only record the

  h264/aac to FLV, allowing the user to output to various different

Overview
--------------------------
This feature allows multiple audio mixers to be used at a time.  This
capability was able to be added with surprisingly very little extra
overhead.  Audio will not be mixed unless it's assigned to a specific
mixer, and mixers will not mix unless they have an active mix
connection.

Mostly this will be useful for being able to separate out specific audio
for recording versus streaming, but will also be useful for certain
streaming services that support multiple audio streams via RTMP.

I didn't want to use a variable amount of mixers due to the desire to
reduce heap allocations, so currently I set the limit to 4 simultaneous
mixers; this number can be increased later if needed, but honestly I
feel like it's just the right number to use.

Sources:

Sources can now specify which audio mixers their audio is mixed to; this
can be a single mixer or multiple mixers at a time.  The
obs_source_set_audio_mixers function sets the audio mixer which an audio
source applies to.  For example, 0xF would mean that the source applies
to all four mixers.

Audio Encoders:

Audio encoders now must specify which specific audio mixer they use when
they encode audio data.

Outputs:

Outputs that use encoders can now support multiple audio tracks at once
if they have the OBS_OUTPUT_MULTI_TRACK capability flag set.  This is
mostly only useful for certain types of RTMP transmissions, though may
be useful for file formats that support multiple audio tracks as well
later on."

When you launch the source properties for the first time, the settings
for the source are empty and default values are used.  With the new
OK/Cancel buttons that were recently merged, it first saves the old
settings, then if the user cancels applies those old settings.

However, because the first settings are always empty, obs_source_update
will try to apply the old settings (which are empty) to the modified
settings, but it can't reset to those settings because it's technically
not applying any settings at all.

In other words, when you create the source and modified the properties
for your first time, pressing cancel would not reset anything at all.

This fixes that issue by clearing the current settings with
obs_data_clear before updating the source with the old settings, which
ensures that any settings that were empty are reset to an empty status."

Direct3D textures are usually aligned to a specific pitch, so their
internal width is often not equal to the expected output width; this
means that if we want to use it on our texture output, that we must
de-align the texture while copying the texture data.

However, I unintentionally messed up the calculation at some point with
RGBA textures, so the variable size I was supposed to be using was
supposed to be multiplied by 4 (for RGBA), while I was still expecting
single channel data.  So, if the texture width was something like 1332,
the source (directx) texture line size would be somewhere at or above
5328 (because it's RGBA), then destination is at 1332 (YUV luma plane),
and it would unintentionally treat 3996 (or 5328 - 1332) bytes as the
unused alignment data.  So this fixes that miscalculation."

A: When you go to style the mixer list in regards to adding a border,
shadow, or glow, it needs to be done on the QFrame. If you do it on the

can cause a little bit of interference with the process and on rare
occasions cause it to crash.

The reason I did this is because I noticed that on rare occasions that
it wouldn't hook due to the low interval; usually just because the
target process is busy and isn't able to process its message queue, and
therefor the hook wouldn't go through due to the fact that
SetWindowsHookEx won't inject until the set event has occurred.  The
inject helper program would just close before the thread message had
finally been processed, which would cancel the SetWindowsHookEx hooking."

the volume control to stretch way too far to the right, making the

Previously, the design for the interaction between the encoder thread
and the graphics thread was that the encoder thread would signal to the
graphics thread when to start drawing each frame.  The original idea
behind this was to prevent mutually cascading stalls of encoding or
graphics rendering (i.e., if rendering took too long, then encoding
would have to catch up, then rendering would have to catch up again, and
so on, cascading upon each other).  The ultimate goal was to prevent
encoding from impacting graphics and vise versa.

However, eventually it was realized that there were some fundamental
flaws with this design.

1. Stray frame duplication.  You could not guarantee that a frame would
   render on time, so sometimes frames would unintentionally be lost if
   there was any sort of minor hiccup or if the thread took too long to
   be scheduled I'm guessing.

2. Frame timing in the rendering thread was less accurate.  The only
   place where frame timing was accurate was in the encoder thread, and
   the graphics thread was at the whim of thread scheduling.  On higher
   end computers it was typically fine, but it was just generally not
   guaranteed that a frame would be rendered when it was supposed to be
   rendered.

So the solution (originally proposed by r1ch and paibox) is to instead
keep the encoding and graphics threads separate as usual, but instead of
the encoder thread controlling the graphics thread, the graphics thread
now controls the encoder thread.  The encoder thread keeps a limited
cache of frames, then the graphics thread copies frames in to the cache
and increments a semaphore to schedule the encoder thread to encode that
data.

In the cache, each frame has an encode counter.  If the frame cache is
full (e.g., the encoder taking too long to return frames), it will not
cache a new frame, but instead will just increment the counter on the
last frame in the cache to schedule that frame to encode again, ensuring
that frames are on time and reducing CPU usage by lowering video
complexity.  If the graphics thread takes too long to render a frame,
then it will add that frame with the count value set to the total amount
of frames that were missed (actual legitimately duplicated frames).

Because the cache gives many frames of breathing room for the encoder to
encode frames, this design helps improve results especially when using
encoding presets that have higher complexity and CPU usage, minimizing
the risk of needlessly skipped or duplicated frames.

I also managed to sneak in what should be a bit of an optimization to
reduce copying of frame data, though how much of an optimization it
ultimately ends up being is debatable.

So to sum it up, this commit increases accuracy of frame timing,
completely removes stray frame duplication, gives better results for
higher complexity encoding presets, and potentially optimizes the frame
pipeline a tiny bit."

transitioning volume was.  However, the problem with this is that the
design didn't take in to account if the source or its sub-sources were
active anywhere else, so because of that it would break if that ever
happened, and I didn't realize that when I was designing it.

So instead, this completely overhauls the design of handling
transitioning volume.  Each frame, it'll go through all sources and
check whether they're active or inactive and set the base volume
accordingly.  If transitions are currently active, it will actually walk
the active source tree and check whether the source is in a
transitioning state somewhere.

 - If the source is a sub-source of a transition, and it's not active
   outside of the transition, then the transition will control the
   volume of the source.

 - If the source is a sub-source of a transition, but it's also active
   outside of the transition, it'll defer to whichever is louder.

This also adds a new callback to the obs_source_info structure for
transition sources, get_transition_volume, which is called to get the
transitioning volume of a sub-source."

The reason to keep a reference counter for transitions is due to an
optimization I'm planning on when calculating transition volumes.  I'm
planning on walking the source tree to be able to calculate the current
base volume of a source, but *only* if there are transitions active,
because the only time that the volume can be anything other than 1.0
or 0.0 is when there are active transitions, which may change the base
volume of a source."

These encoders have some limitations, such as limited resolutions

only supports YV12, which requires conversion if the current output

blurry.

If the output resolution is close to the base resolution, then bilinear
is used instead as an optimization, as there's no need to use these
shaders if scaling is not in use.

The Bicubic and Lanczos effects are also exposed via exported function
to allow the ability to use those shaders in plugin modules if desired.

This replaces the old code for the audio meter that was using
calculations in two different places with the new audio meter api.
The source signal will now emit simple levels instead of dB values,
in order to avoid dB conversion and calculation in the source.
The GUI on the other hand now expects simple position values from
the volume meter api with no knowledge about dB calculus either.
That way all code that handles those conversions is in one place,
with the option to easily add new mappings that can be used
everywhere."

Currently only a cubic mapping (mul = fader_pos ^ 3) is included, but
different mappings can easily be added.

Due to libobs saving/restoring the source volume from the multiplier,
the volume levels for existing source will stay the same, and live
changing of the mapping will work without changing the source volume."

If you look at the previous commits, you'll see I had added
obs_source_draw before.  For custom drawn sources in particular, each
time obs_source_draw was called, it would restart the effect and its
passes for each draw call, which was not optimal.  It should really use
the effect functions for that.  I'll have to add a function to simplify
effect usage.

I also realized that including the color matrix parameters in
obs_source_draw made the function kind of messy to use; instead,
separating the color matrix stuff out to
obs_source_draw_set_color_matrix feels a lot more clean.

On top of that, having the ability to set the position would be nice to
have as well, rather than having to mess with the matrix stuff each
time, so I also added that for the sake of convenience.

obs_source_draw will draw a texture sprite, optionally of a specific
size and/or at a specific position, as well as optionally inverted.  The
texture used will be set to the 'image' parameter of whatever effect is
currently active.

obs_source_draw_set_color_matrix will set the color matrix value if the
drawing requires color matrices.  It will set the 'color_matrix',
'color_range_min', and 'color_range_max' parameters of whatever effect
is currently active.

Overall, these feel much more clean to use than the previous iteration."

XComposite, which is currently our only capture method for windows,
doesn't handle X border width. This works in a lot of cases but anytime
there's a border, a bug occurs where the lower right is clipped.  This
patch has two goals:

1) To position and size the capture texture correctly in accordance to
the border.

2) Adds a configuration option to allow people to toggle it (which in
most cases will simply do nothing) with a default of not including it."

My original intention was ""don't accept audio until video has started"",

way to handle outputs hooking in to active encoders and compensating
their existing timestamp information.

However, this made me realize that there was a major flaw in the design
for handling this, so I basically rewrote the entire thing.

Now, it does the following steps when inserting packets:

- Insert packets in to the interleaved packet array

- When both audio/video packets are received, prune packets up until the
  point in which both audio/video start at the same time

- Resort the interleaved packet array

If audio timestamps are within the operating system timing threshold,

This potentially fixes an issue with plugins that use OS timestamps
directly as timestamp values for their audio samples, and bypasses the
timing conversions to system time for the audio line and uses it
directly as the timestamp value.  It prevents those calculations from
potentially affecting the audio timestamp value when OS timestamps are
used.

For example, if the first set of audio samples from the audio source
came in delayed, while the subsequent samples were not delayed, those
first samples could have potentially inadvertently triggered the timing
adjustments, which would affect all subsequent audio samples."

a higher threshold than the threshold used for detecting OS timestamps

Add 'flags' member variable to obs_source_frame structure.

The OBS_VIDEO_UNBUFFERED flags causes the video to play back as soon as
it's received (in the next frame playback), causing it to disregard the
timestamp value for the sake of video playback (however, note that the
video timestamp is still used for audio synchronization if audio is
present on the source as well).

This is partly a convenience feature, and partly a necessity for certain
plugins (such as the linux v4l plugin) where timestamp information for
the video frames can sometimes be unreliable."

Due to a small error in the timestamp smoothing code the timestamp of
audio packages that were too early was always set to the next expected
timestamp, even if the difference was bigger than the smoothing threshold.

This would cause obs to simply append all audio data to the buffer even if
the real timestamp was way smaller than the next that was expected.

This should reduce corruption problems with for example the pulseaudio
plugin, which resends data under certain conditions."

This changes the font plugin from using a font file to using a specific
installed system font, which is searched for on each specific system and
associated with the font file.  It now uses a font property instead of a
path property, and font size has been removed because the font property
now handles that.

When the module is first loaded, it will build up a list of system fonts
in order to be usable by Freetype.  It was quite painful to program this
because font files can contain multiple localized versions of their face
names, and then there was the issue where windows likes to mangle
custom style types to the font name.  Regardless, it all seems to have
worked out pretty well.

Minor issues:
- Truetype/Opentype fonts sometimes do not automatically have
  italic and/or bold styles available, it seems that the system applies
  transformations manually in those cases.  We don't do this yet,
  however, so right now a user might select a font with italic/bold
  only to discover that italic/bold doesn't always work.  Not entirely
  sure what to do about this yet.  There's probably a freetype function
  to do something like that somehow,

This also requires that iconv be used for non-windows systems to be able
to look up localized font names within font files.  Windows will use
the win32 API and code page IDs to translate font names."

This is sort of hard to explain:  the scale_video_output function was
overwriting the current frame.  If scaling was disabled, it would do
nothing, and return success, and all would be well.  If it was enabled,
it would then call the scaler, and then replace the contents of the
'data' function parameter with the scaled frame data.  The problem with
this is that I was passing video_output::cur_frame directly, which
overwrites its previous value with the scaled frame data.  Then if
cur_frame was not updated on time, it would end up trying to scale the
previously scaled image, if that makes sense.  it would call the video
scaler with the same from for both the source and destination.

So the simple fix was to simply use a local variable and pass that in as
a parameter to prevent this bug from occurring."

API Removed:
- graphics_t obs_graphics();
Replaced With:
- void obs_enter_graphics();
- void obs_leave_graphics();

Description:
  obs_graphics() was somewhat of a pointless function.  The only time
that it was ever necessary was to pass it as a parameter to
gs_entercontext() followed by a subsequent gs_leavecontext() call after
that.  So, I felt that it made a bit more sense just to implement
obs_enter_graphics() and obs_leave_graphics() functions to do the exact
same thing without having to repeat that code.  There's really no need
to ever ""hold"" the graphics pointer, though I suppose that could change
in the future so having a similar function come back isn't out of the
question.

Still, this at least reduces the amount of unnecessary repeated code for
the time being."

Changed:
- obs_source_gettype
To:
- enum obs_source_type obs_source_get_type(obs_source_t source);
- const char *obs_source_get_id(obs_source_t source);

This function was inconsistent for a number of reasons.  First, it
returns both the ID and the type of source (input/transition/filter),
which is inconsistent with the name of ""get type"".  Secondly, the
'squishy' naming convention which has just turned out to be bad

Changed API:
- char *obs_find_plugin_file(const char *sub_path);

  Changed to: char *obs_module_file(const char *file);

  Cahnge it so you no longer need to specify a sub-path such as:
  obs_find_plugin_file(""module_name/file.ext"")

  Instead, now automatically handle the module data path so all you need
  to do is:
  obs_module_file(""file.ext"")

- int obs_load_module(const char *name);

  Changed to: int obs_open_module(obs_module_t *module,
                                  const char *path,
                                  const char *data_path);
              bool obs_init_module(obs_module_t module);

  Change the module loading API so that if the front-end chooses, it can
  load modules directly from a specified path, and associate a data
  directory with it on the spot.

  The module will not be initialized immediately; obs_init_module must
  be called on the module pointer in order to fully initialize the
  module.  This is done so a module can be disabled by the front-end if
  the it so chooses.

New API:
- void obs_add_module_path(const char *bin, const char *data);

  These functions allow you to specify new module search paths to add,
  and allow you to search through them, or optionally just load all
  modules from them.  If the string %module% is included, it will
  replace it with the module's name when that string is used as a
  lookup.  Data paths are now directly added to the module's internal
  storage structure, and when obs_find_module_file is used, it will look
  up the pointer to the obs_module structure and get its data directory
  that way.

  Example:
  obs_add_module_path(""/opt/obs/my-modules/%module%/bin"",
                      ""/opt/obs/my-modules/%module%/data"");

  This would cause it to additionally look for the binary of a
  hypthetical module named ""foo"" at /opt/obs/my-modules/foo/bin/foo.so
  (or libfoo.so), and then look for the data in
  /opt/obs/my-modules/foo/data.

  This gives the front-end more flexibility for handling third-party
  plugin modules, or handling all plugin modules in a custom way.

- void obs_find_modules(obs_find_module_callback_t callback, void
                        *param);

  This searches the existing paths for modules and calls the callback
  function when any are found.  Useful for plugin management and custom
  handling of the paths by the front-end if desired.

- void obs_load_all_modules(void);

  Search through the paths and both loads and initializes all modules
  automatically without custom handling.

- void obs_enum_modules(obs_enum_module_callback_t callback,
                        void *param);

  Enumerates currently opened modules."

This causes the main window to signal the application to exit and delete
its own pointer on close.  This fixes an issue where apparently some
windows that aren't explicitly connected to the main window would be
left open when the main window was closed because by default Qt will
only exit when all windows have been closed.

Because it deletes its own pointer, instead of storing it in a
std::unique_ptr, use a QPointer because it has an internal mechanism for
automatically tracking QObject deletion even if the deletion was not
done on the QPointer itself, where as unique_ptr does not have that
functionality.  In other words, if the pointer is deleted elsewhere for
whatever reason, the QPointer will still set that internal pointer value
to null.

There's no need to initialize the map value to 0.  What was happening is
that obs_scene_add was adding a ref to a non-existent value, which
simply created it and added 1, which is perfectly fine.  Then,
obs_add_source would set the ref to 0, overwriting the existing value.

So this meant that if you didn't call them in the right order, it
wouldn't work properly, and would break, which was pretty stupid.

Turns out that if you access a map value that doesn't exist, it'll
create one with the default constructor of that type.  In this case, int
will initialize to 0, which was exactly what we wanted in the first
place, and defeats the purpose of even needing to initialize the value
to 0.  So, there's no need to manually set it to 0 in
OBSBasic::SourceAdded, or worry about the order in which the functions
are called.

Just goes to show you have to be careful with reference counting."

If the scene item has a bounding box set up for it, do not make it use
aspect ratio clamping by default.

Instead, make it so that shift will turn on aspect ratio, and make it
also apply to all types of bounding box modes.

The only time where aspect ratio clamping should apply by default is
when bounds are not in use (i.e. when a source is just created).  Some
will disagree with me just because that's how photoshop does it, but
we're not photoshop, and I feel that the majority of users will have
more trouble with it disabled by default than enabled by default.

So to sum it up:

If bounds inactive, clamp aspect ratio by default, because scene items
start out with it inactive, and it directly affects the scale.

If bounds active, do not clamp aspect ratio by default, because clamping
to aspect ratio doesn't particularly have an effect for mode bounds
modes except for ""stretch to bounds""."

So, scene editing was interesting (and by interesting I mean
excruciating).  I almost implemented 'manipulator' visuals (ala 3dsmax
for example), and used 3 modes for controlling position/rotation/size,
but in a 2D editing, it felt clunky, so I defaulted back to simply
click-and-drag for movement, and then took a similar though slightly
different looking approach for handling scaling and reszing.

I also added a number of menu item helpers related to positioning,
scaling, rotating, flipping, and resetting the transform back to
default.

There is also a new 'transform' dialog (accessible via menu) which will
allow you to manually edit every single transform variable of a scene
item directly if desired.

If a scene item does not have bounds active, pulling on the sides of a
source will cause it to resize it via base scale rather than by the
bounding box system (if the source resizes that scale will apply).  If
bounds are active, it will modify the bounding box only instead.

How a source scales when a bounding box is active depends on the type of
bounds being used.  You can set it to scale to the inner bounds, the
outer bounds, scale to bounds width only, scale to bounds height only,
and a setting to stretch to bounds (which forces a source to always draw
at the bounding box size rather than be affected by its internal size).
You can also set it to be used as a 'maximum' size, so that the source
doesn't necessarily get scaled unless it extends beyond the bounds.

Like in OBS1, objects will snap to the edges unless the control key is
pressed.  However, this will now happen even if the object is rotated or
oriented in any strange way.  Snapping will also occur when stretching
or changing the bounding box size."

There are a ridiculous number of features related to scaling and
positioning due to requests by a number of people who complained that
they hated the way that OBS1 would always resize their sources when the
source's base size changed.  There were also people who wanted more
control for how the resizing was handled, or the ability to completely
prevent resizing entirely if desired.  So I made it so that you can
optionally use a 'bounds' system, which allows you to specify different
styles of controlling resizing.

If disabled, the source will always automatically resize and only the
base scale is applied.  If enabled, you have a variety of different ways
to limit/control how it can resize within the bounds, or make it so it
can't resize at all.  You can also control alignment within that
bounding box, so you can make it so that a source always aligns to a
side or corner of the box.

I also added an alignment value which changes how the source is oriented
relative to the position of the scene item.  For example, setting
bottom-right alignment will make it so that the position of the item is
the bottom right corner of the source.  When the source resizies, it
will resize leftward and upward in that case, which solves the problem
of how a source resizes relative to a desired position."

usable in 10.8, only 10.9.  So, instead of being able to use it like a
normal, sane person, we have to enumerate all devices manually and find
the AudioDeviceID ourselves.  A slight annoyance and a mark against
apple's competence, but audio devices should now be working again on

I'm still not 100% sure on if this is how I want to approach the

audio_line, but it can always be moved later if needed.

This uses the calculations by the awesome Bill Hamilton that OBS1 used
for its volume levels.  It calculates the current max (level),
magnitude, and current peak.  This data then can be used to create
awesome volume meter controls later on.

NOTE: Will probably need optimization, does one float at a time right

The biggest problem with DirectShow is that available configuration
capabilities can change if you so much as look at it the wrong way.

Previously, configuring devices often didn't configure the device
settings correctly, you would choose one setting and then another
setting wouldn't be compatible with that settings.

Let's take the terrible microsoft lifecam series for example.  First,
you'd be at 640x480 happily webcam'ing away, which is using the YUY2
format.  Then you decide ""hey, this webcam resolution is a bit low.  I
would love to have it a bit high resolution so it's a bit more crisp and
clear.""  You'd select 1280x720, and then suddenly the only format
supported is MJPEG output.  However, the interface has to update that
fact, it can't list YUY2 if MJPEG is the only one available for this
resolution.  This doesn't just apply to formats either, this applies to
framerates and such as well.  Some framerates will only be supported by
certain resolutions which can in turn only be supported by certain
formats.

This causes user interface for configuration to be really be a nightmare
to manage if you want these features to be available to the user.  It's
extremely annoying because you have to update all the configuration UI
after something has changed, double check the configuration values, and
if the values aren't supported, update those configuration values."

of saving directly in the program, if you do and the program crashes,
that MP4 file is lost.  I'm contemplating making some sort of mp4 output

If you need MP4, just remux it with FFmpeg:

I had forgotten how constants worked when compiled; constants are
uploaded as constant registers.  When constants are used with shaders,
multiple constants are often packed in to a single register when
possible to reduce constant register count.

For example, one 'float' constant and one 'float3' constant will be
packed in to a single register (c0.x for constant 1, c0.yzw for constant
2), but two 'float' constants and one 'float3' constant must inhabit two
registers (c0.xy for constant 1, c1.xyz for constant 2), so it must
start on a new register boundry (every 16 bytes).

I had first instinctively thought it was just a simple case of
alignment like it is on the CPU, but then I realized that it didn't
sound right, so I went back and did some more tests and then ultimately
remembered how constants actually are uploaded."

Starting with VS2012, microsoft made a terribly stupid change to the way
working directory is handled.  It basically will not work properly if
you need to run your executable from a specific location, it would only
run properly from debug if you also had your target directory set to an
environment variable, which was incredibly stupid.  The visual studio
development team is run by chimpanzees with tiny brains, headed by
a broken AI core designed by gilbert gottfried.

I made a workaround for it so that it's much easier to set up debugging
in VS2013, so that all you need to do is enter in the the working
directory for it to work properly.  Still somewhat of a pain but the Qt
addin kept overwriting the god forsaken environment path, and made
setting it up much more difficult than it was supposed to be."

 - Updated the services API so that it links up with an output and
   the output gets data from that service rather than via settings.
   This allows the service context to have control over how an output is
   used, and makes it so that the URL/key/etc isn't necessarily some
   static setting.

   Also, if the service is attached to an output, it will stick around
   until the output is destroyed.

 - The settings interface has been updated so that it can allow the
   usage of service plugins.  What this means is that now you can create
   a service plugin that can control aspects of the stream, and it
   allows each service to create their own user interface if they create
   a service plugin module.

 - Testing out saving of current service information.  Saves/loads from
   JSON in to obs_data_t, seems to be working quite nicely, and the
   service object information is saved/preserved on exit, and loaded
   again on startup.

 - I agonized over the settings user interface for days, and eventually
   I just decided that the only way that users weren't going to be
   fumbling over options was to split up the settings in to simple/basic
   output, pre-configured, and then advanced for advanced use (such as
   multiple outputs or services, which I'll implement later).

   This was particularly painful to really design right, I wanted more
   features and wanted to include everything in one interface but
   ultimately just realized from experience that users are just not
   technically knowledgable about it and will end up fumbling with the
   settings rather than getting things done.

   Basically, what this means is that casual users only have to enter in
   about 3 things to configure their stream:  Stream key, audio bitrate,
   and video bitrate.  I am really happy with this interface for those
   types of users, but it definitely won't be sufficient for advanced
   usage or for custom outputs, so that stuff will have to be separated.

 - Improved the JSON usage for the 'common streaming services' context,
   I realized that JSON arrays are there to ensure sorting, while
   forgetting that general items are optimized for hashing.  So
   basically I'm just using arrays now to sort items in it."

Add API for streaming services.  The services API simplifies the
creation of custom service features and user interface.

Custom streaming services later on will be able to do things such as:

 - Be able to use service-specific APIs via modules, allowing a more
   direct means of communicating with the service and requesting or
   setting service-specific information

 - Get URL/stream key via other means of authentication such as OAuth,
   or be able to build custom URLs for services that require that sort
   of thing.

 - Query information (such as viewer count, chat, follower
   notifications, and other information)

 - Set channel information (such as current game, current channel title,
   activating commercials)

Also, I reduce some repeated code that was used for all libobs objects.
This includes the name of the object, the private data, settings, as
well as the signal and procedure handlers.

I also switched to using linked lists for the global object lists,
rather than using an array of pointers (you could say it was..
pointless.)  ..Anyway, the linked list info is also stored in the shared

A little bit of history about frame dropping:

I did a large number of experiments with frame dropping in old versions
of OBS1, and it's not an easy thing to deal with.  I tried just about
everything from standard i-frame delay, to large buffers, to dumping
packets, to super-unnecessarily-complex things that just ended up
causing more problems than they was worth.

When I did my experiments, I found that the most ideal frame drop system
(in terms of reducing the amount of total data that needed to be
dropped) was in the 0.4xx days where I had a 3 second frame-drop buffer
where I could calculate the actual buffer size in bytes, and then
intellgently choose packets in that buffer to trim it down to a specific
size while minimizing the number of p-frames and i-frames dropped, and
preventing the actual impact of dropped frames on the stream.  The
downside of it was that it required too much extra latency, and far too
many people complained about it, so it was removed in favor of the
current system.

The current system I just refer to just as 'packet dumping', which when
combined with low keyframe intervals (like most services use these
days), is the next-best method from my experience.  Just dump the buffer
when you reach a threshold of buffering (which I prefer to measure with
time rather than in size), then wait for a new i-frame.  Simple,
effective, and reduces the risk of consecutive buffering, while still
having fairly low impact on the stream output due to the low keyframe
interval of services.

By the way, audio will not (and should not ever) be dropped, lest you
end up with syncing issues (among other nasty things) specific to server
implementation."

 - Implement the RTMP output module.  This time around, we just use a
   simple FLV muxer, then just write to the stream with RTMP_Write.
   Easy and effective.

 - Fix the FLV muxer, the muxer now outputs proper FLV packets.

 - Output API:
   * When using encoders, automatically interleave encoded packets
     before sending it to the output.

   * Pair encoders and have them automatically wait for the other to
     start to ensure sync.

   * Change 'obs_output_signal_start_fail' to 'obs_output_signal_stop'
     because it was a bit confusing, and doing this makes a lot more
     sense for outputs that need to stop suddenly (disconnections/etc).

 - Encoder API:
   * Remove some unnecessary encoder functions from the actual API and
     make them internal.  Most of the encoder functions are handled
     automatically by outputs anyway, so there's no real need to expose
     them and end up inadvertently confusing plugin writers.

   * Have audio encoders wait for the video encoder to get a frame, then
     start at the exact data point that the first video frame starts to
     ensure the most accrate sync of video/audio possible.

   * Add a required 'frame_size' callback for audio encoders that
     returns the expected number of frames desired to encode with.  This
     way, the libobs encoder API can handle the circular buffering
     internally automatically for the encoder modules, so encoder
     writers don't have to do it themselves.

 - Fix a few bugs in the serializer interface.  It was passing the wrong
   variable for the data in a few cases.

 - If a source has video, make obs_source_update defer the actual update
   callback until the tick function is called to prevent threading
   issues."

 - Make it so that encoders can be assigned to outputs.  If an encoder
   is destroyed, it will automatically remove itself from that output.
   I specifically didn't want to do reference counting because it leaves
   too much potential for unchecked references and it just felt like it
   would be more trouble than it's worth.

 - Add a 'flags' value to the output definition structure.  This lets
   the output specify if it uses video/audio, and whether the output is
   meant to be used with OBS encoders or not.

 - Remove boilerplate code for outputs.  This makes it easier to program
   outputs.  The boilerplate code involved before was mostly just
   involving connecting to the audio/video data streams directly in each
   output plugin.

   Instead of doing that, simply add plugin callback functions for
   receiving video/audio (either encoded or non-encoded, whichever it's
   set to use), and then call obs_output_begin_data_capture and
   obs_output_end_data_capture to automatically handle setting up
   connections to raw or encoded video/audio streams for the plugin.

 - Remove 'active' function from output callbacks, as it's no longer
   really needed now that the libobs output context automatically knows
   when the output is active or not.

 - Make it so that an encoder cannot be destroyed until all data
   connections to the encoder have been removed.

 - Change the 'start' and 'stop' functions in the encoder interface to
   just an 'initialize' callback, which initializes the encoder.

 - Make it so that the encoder must be initialized first before the data
   stream can be started.  The reason why initialization was separated
   from starting the encoder stream was because we need to be able to
   check that the settings used with the encoder *can* be used first.

   This problem was especially annoying if you had both video/audio
   encoding.  Before, you'd have to check the return value from
   obs_encoder_start, and if that second encoder fails, then you
   basically had to stop the first encoder again, making for
   unnecessary boilerplate code whenever starting up two encoders."

 - Implement OBS encoder interface.  It was previously incomplete, but
   now is reaching some level of completion, though probably should
   still be considered preliminary.

   I had originally implemented it so that encoders only have a 'reset'
   function to reset their parameters, but I felt that having both a
   'start' and 'stop' function would be useful.

   Encoders are now assigned to a specific video/audio media output each
   rather than implicitely assigned to the main obs video/audio
   contexts.  This allows separate encoder contexts that aren't
   necessarily assigned to the main video/audio context (which is useful
   for things such as recording specific sources).  Will probably have
   to do this for regular obs outputs as well.

   When creating an encoder, you must now explicitely state whether that
   encoder is an audio or video encoder.

   Audio and video can optionally be automatically converted depending
   on what the encoder specifies.

   When something 'attaches' to an encoder, the first attachment starts
   the encoder, and the encoder automatically attaches to the media
   output context associated with it.  Subsequent attachments won't have
   the same effect, they will just start receiving the same encoder data
   when the next keyframe plays (along with SEI if any).  When detaching
   from the encoder, the last detachment will fully stop the encoder and
   detach the encoder from the media output context associated with the
   encoder.

   SEI must actually be exported separately; because new encoder
   attachments may not always be at the beginning of the stream, the
   first keyframe they get must have that SEI data in it.  If the
   encoder has SEI data, it needs only add one small function to simply
   query that SEI data, and then that data will be handled automatically
   by libobs for all subsequent encoder attachments.

 - Implement x264 encoder plugin, move x264 files to separate plugin to
   separate necessary dependencies.

 - Change video/audio frame output structures to not use const
   qualifiers to prevent issues with non-const function usage elsewhere.
   This was an issue when writing the x264 encoder, as the x264 encoder
   expects non-const frame data.

   Change stagesurf_map to return a non-const data type to prevent this
   as well.

 - Change full range parameter of video scaler to be an enum rather than
   boolean"

 - Add some temporary streaming code using FFmpeg.  FFmpeg itself is not
   very ideal for streaming; lack of direct control of the sockets and
   no framedrop handling means that FFmpeg is definitely not something
   you want to use without wrapper code.  I'd prefer writing my own
   network framework in this particular case just because you give away
   so much control of the network interface.  Wasted an entire day
   trying to go through FFmpeg issues.

   There's just no way FFmpeg should be used for real streaming (at
   least without being patched or submitting some sort of patch, but I'm
   sort of feeling ""meh"" on that idea)

   I had to end up writing multiple threads just to handle both
   connecting and writing, because av_interleaved_write_frame blocks
   every call, stalling the main encoder thread, and thus also stalling
   draw signals.

 - Add some temporary user interface for streaming settings.  This is
   just temporary for the time being.  It's in the outputs section of
   the basic-mode settings

 - Make it so that dynamic arrays do not free all their data when the
   size just happens to be reduced to 0.  This prevents constant
   reallocation when an array keeps going from 1 item to 0 items.  Also,
   it was bad to become dependent upon that functionality.  You must now
   always explicitly call ""free"" on it to ensure the data is free, and
   that's how it should be.  Implicit functionality can lead to
   confusion and maintainability issues."

   graphics mutex and then while in the graphics mutex could lock the
   channels mutex.  Meanwhile in another thread, the channel mutex could
   get locked, and then the graphics mutex would get locked, causing a
   deadlock.

   The best way to deal with this is to not let mutexes lock within

 - Split input and output audio captures so that they're different
   sources.  This allows easier handling and enumeration of audio
   devices without having to do some sort of string processing.

   This way the user interface code can handle this a bit more easily,
   and so that it doesn't confuse users either.  This should be done for
   all audio capture sources for all operating systems.  You don't have
   to duplicate any code, you just need to create input/output wrapper
   functions to designate the audio as input or output before creation.

 - Make it detect soundflower and wavtap devices as mac ""output"" devices
   (even though they're actually input) for the mac output capture, and
   make it so that users can select a default output capture and
   automatically use soundflower or wavtap.

   I'm not entirely happy about having to do this, but because mac is
   designed this way, this is really the only way to handle it that
   makes it easier for users and UI code to deal with.

   Note that soundflower and wavtap are still also designated as input
   devices, so will still show up in input device enumeration.

 - Remove pragma messages because they were kind polluting the other
   compiler messages and just getting in the way.  In the future we can
   just do a grep for TODO to find them.

 - Redo list property again, this time using a safer internal array,
   rather than requiring sketchy array inputs.  Having functions handle
   everything behind the scenes is much safer.

 - Remove obs_source::type because it became redundant now that the
   type is always stored in the obs_source::info variable.

 - Apply presentation volumes of 1.0 and 0.0 to sources when they
   activate/deactivate, respectively.  It also applies that presentation
   volume to all sub-sources, with exception of transition sources.
   Transition sources must apply presentation volume manually to their
   sub-sources with the new transition functions below.

 - Add a ""transition_volume"" variable to obs_source structure, and add
   three functions for handling volume for transitions:

   * obs_transition_begin_frame
   * obs_source_set_transition_vol
   * obs_transition_end_frame

   Because the to/from targets of a transition source might both contain
   some of the same sources, handling the transitioning of volumes for
   that specific situation becomes an issue.

   So for transitions, instead of modifying the presentation volumes
   directly for both sets of sources, we do this:

   - First, call obs_transition_begin_frame at the beginning of each
     transition frame, which will reset transition volumes for all
     sub-sources to 0.  Presentation volumes remain unchanged.

   - Call obs_source_set_transition_vol on each sub-source, which will
     then add the volume to the transition volume for each source in
     that source's tree.  Presentation volumes still remain unchanged.

   - Then you call obs_trandition_end_frame when complete, which will
     then finally set the presentation volumes to the transition
     volumes.

   For example, let's say that there's one source that's within both the
   ""transitioning from"" sources and ""transition to"" sources.  It would
   add both the fade in and fade out volumes to that source, and then
   when the frame is complete, it would set the presentation volume to
   the sum of those two values, rather than set the presentation volume
   for that same source twice which would cause weird volume jittering
   and also set the wrong values."

Originally, the rendering system was designed to only display sources

the main viewport in a custom way, or maybe even the entire application

Displays have now been separated in to viewports and displays.  A
viewport is used to store and draw sources, a display is used to handle
draw callbacks.  You can even use displays without using viewports to
draw custom render displays containing graphics calls if you wish, but
usually they would be used in combination with source viewports at
least.

This requires a tiny bit more work to create simple source displays, but
in the end its worth it for the added flexibility and options it brings."

The API used to be designed in such a way to where it would expect
exports for each individual source/output/encoder/etc.  You would export
functions for each and it would automatically load those functions based
on a specific naming scheme from the module.

The idea behind this was that I wanted to limit the usage of structures
in the API so only functions could be used.  It was an interesting idea
in theory, but this idea turned out to be flawed in a number of ways:

 1.) Requiring exports to create sources/outputs/encoders/etc meant that
     you could not create them by any other means, which meant that
     things like faruton's .net plugin would become difficult.

 2.) Export function declarations could not be checked, therefore if you
     created a function with the wrong parameters and parameter types,
     the compiler wouldn't know how to check for that.

 3.) Required overly complex load functions in libobs just to handle it.
     It makes much more sense to just have a load function that you call
     manually.  Complexity is the bane of all good programs.

 4.) It required that you have functions of specific names, which looked
     and felt somewhat unsightly.

So, to fix these issues, I replaced it with a more commonly used API
scheme, seen commonly in places like kernels and typical C libraries
with abstraction.  You simply create a structure that contains the
callback definitions, and you pass it to a function to register that
definition (such as obs_register_source), which you call in the
obs_module_load of the module.

It will also automatically check the structure size and ensure that it
only loads the required values if the structure happened to add new
values in an API change.

The ""main"" source file for each module must include obs-module.h, and
must use OBS_DECLARE_MODULE() within that source file.

Also, started writing some doxygen documentation in to the main library
headers.  Will add more detailed documentation as I go."

Add the ability to be able to call and use toolkit-specific or
program-specific user interface in modules.

User interface code can be either bundled with the module, or 'split'
out in to separate libraries (recommended).

There are three reasons why splitting is recommended:

  1.) It allows plugins to be able to create custom user interface for
      each toolkit if desired.

  2.) Often, UI will be programmed in one language (the language of the
      toolkit), and core logic may be programmed in another.  This
      allows plugins to keep the languages separated if necessary.

  3.) It prevents direct linkage of UI toolkits libraries with core
      module logic.

Splitting is not required, though is recommended if you want your plugin
to be more flexible with other user interface toolkits or programs.

Will implement a generic properties lookup next, which will be used for
automatic UI handling so that plugin UI isn't necessarily required."

causing a race condition.  I changed the code so that it signals after
the lock instead of before, so the scene parameter should no longer be
necessary."

- Add 'set_default' functions to obs-data.*.  These functions ensure
  that a paramter exists and that the parameter is of a specific type.
  If not, it will create or overwrite the value with the default setting
  instead.

  These functions are meant to be explicitly called before using any of
  the 'get' functions.  The reason why it was designed this way is to
  encourage defaults to be set in a single place/function.

  For example, ideal usage is to create one function for your data,
  ""set_my_defaults(obs_data_t data)"", set all the default values within
  that function, and then call that function on create/update, that way
  all defaults are centralized to a single place.

- Ensure that data passed to sources/encoders/outputs/etc is always
  valid, and not a null value.

- While I'm remembering, fix a few defaults of the main program config
  file data."

--------------------------------------------------
Notes and details
--------------------------------------------------
Why was this done?  Because wxWidgets was just lacking in many areas.  I
know wxWidgets is designed to be used with native controls, and that's
great, but wxWidgets just is not a feature-complete toolkit for
multiplatform applications.  It lacks in dialog editors, its code is
archaic and outdated, and I just feel frustrated every time I try to do
things with it.

Qt on the other hand..  I had to actually try Qt to realize how much
better it was as a toolkit.  They've got everything from dialog editors,
to an IDE, a debugger, build tools, just everything, and it's all
top-notch and highly maintained.  The focus of the toolkit is
application development, and they spend their time trying to help
people do exactly that:  make programs.  Great support, great tools,
and because of that, great toolkit.  I just didn't want to alienate any
developers by being stubborn about native widgets.

There *are* some things that are rather lackluster about it and design
choices I disagree with though.  For example, I realize that to have an
easy to use toolkit you have to have some level of code generation.
However, in my personal and humble opinion, moc just feels like a
terrible way to approach the problem.  Even now I feel like there are a
variety of ways you could handle code generation and automatic
management of things like that.  I don't like the idea of circumventing
the language itself like that.  It feels like one giant massive hack.

--------------------------------------------------
Things that aren't working properly:
--------------------------------------------------
 - Settings dialog is not implemented.  The dialog is complete but the
   code to handle the dialog hasn't been constructed yet.

 - There is a problem with using Qt widgets as a device target on
   windows, with at least OpenGL: if I have the preview widget
   automatically resize itself, it seems to cause some sort of video
   card failure that I don't understand.

 - Because of the above, resizing the preview widget has been disabled
   until I can figure out what's going on, so it's currently only a
   32x32 area.

 - Direct3D doesn't seem to render correctly either, seems that the
   viewport is messed up or something.  I'm sort of confused about
   what's going on with it.

 - The new main window seems to be triggering more race conditions than
   the wxWidgets main window dialog did.  I'm not entirely sure what's
   going on here, but this may just be existing race conditions within
   libobs itself that I just never spotted before (even though I tend to
   be very thorough with race conditions any time I use variables
   cross-thread)"

- First, I redid the output interface for libobs.  I feel like it's
  going in a pretty good direction in terms of design.

  Right now, the design is so that outputs and encoders are separate.
  One or more outputs can connect to a specific encoder to receive its
  data, or the output can connect directly to raw data from libobs
  output itself, if the output doesn't want to use a designated encoder.
  Data is received via callbacks set when you connect to the encoder or
  raw output.  Multiple outputs can receive the data from a single
  encoder context if need be (such as for streaming to multiple channels
  at once, and/or recording with the same data).

  When an encoder is first connected to, it will connect to raw output,
  and start encoding.  Additional connections will receive that same
  data being encoded as well after that.  When the last encoder has
  disconnected, it will stop encoding.  If for some reason the encoder
  needs to stop, it will use the callback with NULL to signal that
  encoding has stopped.  Some of these things may be subject to change
  in the future, though it feels pretty good with this design so far.
  Will have to see how well it works out in practice versus theory.

- Second, Started adding preliminary RTMP/x264 output plugin code.

  To speed things up, I might just make a direct raw->FFmpeg output to
  create a quick output plugin that we can start using for testing all
  the subsystems."

Completely revamped the entire media i/o data and handlers.  The
original idea was to have a system that would have connecting media
inputs and outputs, but at a certain point I realized that this was an
unnecessary complexity for what we wanted to do.  (Also, it reminded me
of directshow filters, and I HATE directshow with a passion, and
wouldn't wish it upon my greatest enemy)

Now, audio/video outputs are connected to directly, with better callback
handlers, and will eventually have the ability to automatically handle
conversions such as 4:4:4 to 4:2:0 when connecting to an input that uses
them.  Doing this will allow the video/audio i/o handlers to also
prevent duplicate conversion, as well as make it easier/simple to use.

My true goal for this is to make output and encoder plugins as simple to
create as possible.  I want to be able to be able to create an output
plugin with almost no real hassle of having to worry about image
conversions, media inputs/outputs, etc.  A plugin developer shouldn't
have to handle that sort of stuff when he/she doesn't really need to.

Plugins will be able to simply create a callback via obs_video() and/or
obs_audio(), and they will automatically receive the audio/video data in
the formats requested via a simple callback, without needing to do
almost anything else at all."

  issues that can happen with specific devices, where timestamps can
  reset or go backward/forward in time with no rhyme or reason.  Spent
  the entire day just trying to figure out the best way to handle this.

  If both audio and video are present, it will increment a reference
  counter if video timestamps invalidate, and decrement the reference
  counter when the audio timestamps invalidate.  When the reference
  counter is not 0, it will not send audio as the audio will have
  invalid timing.  What this does is it ensures audio data will never go
  out of bounds in relation to the video, and waits for both audio and
  video timestamps to ""jump"" together before resuming audio.

- Moved async video frame timing adjustment code into
  obs_source_getframe instead so it's automatically handled whenever
  called.

- Removed the 'audio wait buffer' as it was an unnecessary complexity
  that could have had problems in the future.  Instead, audio will not
  be added until video starts for sources that have both async
  audio/video.  Audio could have buffered for too long of a time anyway,
