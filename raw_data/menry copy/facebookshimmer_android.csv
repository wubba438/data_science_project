Summary:
PR for https://github.com/facebook/shimmer-android/issues/85

It doesn't seem like the best implementation since I'm just nulling the Shimmer but it does the job.

I've tested this in the sample app by depending on the library project rather than the snapshot and added another button for toggling it on and off but haven't included any of that in this PR. If you would like me to I'll update it.

Summary: Instead of trying to compute the correct size of the shimmer draw rect by an incorrect heuristic, we instead apply a matrix transformation to the shader. This means we dont have to calculate a specially sized draw rect to ensure we cover the entire view, but it does mean that we need to enlongate the translation distance by the opposite dimension of the right triangle that is formed with the shimer's tilt and the non primary axis.

Summary:
A rewrite of shimmer to take into account memory/perf issues

The previous version of shimmer would require 3 extra bitmaps to achieve its visual effect.
This version only requires 1 extra hardware layer for views that contain transparency and 0 for those that do
not. This significantly reduces memory consumption in both the Java world and GPU world. It also increases performance.

It does this by taking advantage of the ability compose the effect via a Paint + hardware layer + Porter Duff xfer modes.
In the case of fully opaque views, the shimmer is simply drawn on top of the content.

A preliminary check of the effects of this implementation on the sample app show a 15MB reduction in Java heap usage.
