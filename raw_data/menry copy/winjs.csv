Fixes faulty ""PointerCancel"" event registration in ListView."
AmazingJaze,2017-02-15 23:49:12,https://api.github.com/repos/winjs/winjs/git/commits/a48a12e33e08fccdea7879af877b2cc3a7cb8ec3,a48a12e33e08fccdea7879af877b2cc3a7cb8ec3,"Fixes faulty ""PointerCancel"" event registration in ListView.

WinJS ListView attempts to register for ""PointerCancel"" event, but only the ""pointercancel"" event is supported in all modern browsers, so the event never gets registered.
Today there is no direct impact from this bug, because the ListView relies on ""PointerCancel"" or ""lostpointercapture"" events to clean up UI state if a user on a touch device presses down on a listview item but then drags their finger to  scroll the listview items.
Yoday that user behavior will result in both ""pointercancel"" and ""lostpointercapture"" events being fired synchronously.
However, there is a proposed change that Chrome and Edge may move to implement where the ""lostpointercapture"" event may not fire because pointer capture will no longer be guaranteed to happen synchronously.
Once this change takes effect the ListView will no longer be guaranteed to recieve ""lostpointercapture"" events and will fail to clean up state correctly, unless this ""pointercanel"" event registration is fixed."

we're always recentering items once we've come to a snap point when

before trying to operate on it."

Edge is removing the mselementresize and this new approach gives us a purely event driven javascript based solution that works in every browser we support, whereas mselementresize was only supported in IE11 and the current version of Edge.

-This change migrates the ListView, Pivot, and Hub controls to the _ElementResizeInstrument and removes their dependency on the ""mselementresize"" event.
-This change adds the forceLayout API to the Hub.
-Starting with this change, the Hub will only automatically detect size change events on the root "".win-hub"" element. If developers programatically modify the size of the "".win-hub-surface"" element or the size of the HubSection elements, they will need to call Hub.forceLayout() to notify the Hub that changes have occurred.
-Tests that used to only run in IE11 have been updated to expect automatic resize handling and run everywhere.

WinJS ViewBox, FlipView and SemanticZoom controls will be migrated to use _ElementResizeInstrument in the near future."

Fixes #1149 and #910

When the input pane shows, the ContentDialog's response was to maintain
its top/left position and to shrink its height as much as needed to avoid
being occluded by the input pane. This behavior resulted in a bug where,
if the dialog's top/left was close to the center of the screen, the dialog
could become very short when it resized to get out of the way of the input
pane (#1149).

To fix this, the new way the ContentDialog responds to the input pane is:
  - If the dialog will not be occluded by the input pane, then the dialog
    maintains its current size and position.
  - If the dialog will be occluded by the input pane, the dialog lays
    itself out using its normal layout rules but it does so in the
    unoccluded portion of the window (visible document) rather than in the
    whole window.

There was another bug (#910) where the ContentDialog would become
horizontally off center if the window was resized while the input pane was
showing. This is now fixed because the ContentDialog uses its normal
layout rules even when the input pane is showing.

Other changes:
  - Switiched from .focus() to .scrollIntoView() for keeping the focused
    element in view while resizing the dialog to get out of the input
    pane's way. The motivation for this change was that calling .focus()
    on document.activeElement no longer causes the element to scroll into
    view in Edge.
  - When the ContentDialog is shown, put focus on the root element of the
    dialog rather than on the first focusable element within the dialog's
    content area. The motivation for this change is that .scrollIntoView()
    is more aggressive about scrolling than .focus() was -- it scrolls the
    element to the top of its scroller even if that element was already in
    view. This results in a poor experience when showing the dialog and
    the first focusable element in the content area is a textfield -- the
    user will never have the chance to see the content at the top of the
    dialog because the dialog would immediately scroll it off screen.
    Order of events:
      - Dialog shows and puts focus on the first focusable element
        (assume it's a textfield) in the content area
      - Input pane shows
      - Dialog resizes
      - Dialog calls .scrollIntView() on the textfield to keep it in view
	during the resize thus scrolling the dialog's topmost content off
	the screen"

 Change Description:

     closes https://github.com/winjs/winjs/issues/916
closes https://github.com/winjs/winjs/issues/982

This commit adds specialized knowledge to the control about when to show and hide the overflow button and updates the layout pass to accurately reflow commands based on whether or not overflow button has just claimed or released real estate from within the action area.

The logic to show/hide the overflow button was severely out of date, and did not take into account different closedDisplayModes or that commands in the BindingList could be hidden.
Now the overflow button is only hidden when there are no visible commands what so ever, Or when closedDisplayMode === ""full"" and only the action area has any visible commands.
     Consequently, the private CSS class ""win-commandingsurface-empty"" is no longer being used to ""display: none"" the overflow button whenever there are no commands in the binding list
     and has been removed since was un documented and is no longer used. Anyone who may have been using it to determine whether or not the binding list was empty should instead check if
     (winControl.data.length > 0) on the their AppBar or ToolBar.

Improving these main scenarios revealed other implementation failures with the design that have also been addressed, such as including a minimal layout option to make sure we address the overflow button, even if we can't perform a full layout because the control was in a state where it couldn't measure at the time that a layout was requested.

This commit also adds new unit tests and removes or updates many older tests and utilities geared around the appearance of the overflow button based on an out dated model, before the closedDisplayMode property was introduced.

(deprecation will be a separate checkin.)

     SplitView is a control that has no policy on what sort of content developers put inside its pane. A common pattern among WinJS sample pages is to put NavBarCommands in a SplitView pane since the NavBarCommands look good there and they even had their redlines updated to fit optimally in both the NavBar and SplitView controls.

     The NavBar is not part of the win 10 design language, and will be deprecating shortly. The addition of the SplitViewCommand is to replace the usage of the NavBarCommand inside of a SplitView. A SplitViewCommand needs a subset of the NavBarCommand public API space, so this change moves most of the old NavBarCommand code into the SplitViewCommand and then derives NavBarCommand from the SplitViewCommand."

     This issue is that we were only adding Flyout's to the cascadingStack after we had confirmed that their animation had begun, but we were removing Flyouts to the cascade before they were guaranteed to be able to hide immediately.

     When a flyout is showing or hiding, its animation is uninterruptible, so calling hide() on a flyout that is showing, would result in the ""hide"" operation getting scheduled to be run again asynchronously after the show animation is complete.

     The flyout `_doNext` property tracks any behavior that should attempted after animations complete. It can only track one value so calling:

     flyout.show() // begins show animation, then adds flyout to the cascade.
     flyout.hide() // removes flyout from the cascade, can't interrupt show animation so queues to hide.
     flyout.show() // still can't interrupt original show animation, queues to show

     Results in a shown flyout with a `_doNext` value also of ""show"", which is just treated as a nop, so the flyout never gets added back to the cascading stack.

     The fix is to always append the flyout to the cascade when show() is called regardless if it is able to show immediately or has to be queued up to show. This matches the pattern for when he hide the flyout, and ensures that cascade always matches the latest state of what each flyout is doing or about to do, and is consistent with other existing patterns in the flyout code such as the ""flyout.hidden"" property getter which returns true if the flyout is either already in its hidden state, is animating to hidden state, or is queued to hide."

         -The fix for #1183 involves extracting a function CommandingSurface_canMeasure() from an inline boolean check, and making sure we mark measurements as dirty during resize if we detect that we can't measure.
         -The fix for #1220 involves expanding the logic of the new _canMeasure function to return false if the control is closed and is using closedDisplayModes 'none' or 'minimal'.
         The code for this expanded check needed to access code that should be private, so I refactored the CommandingSurface updateDomImpl object into a JavaScript closure that returns a JavaScript object literal with get Accessors for the data that we want to read.

Task 2905418:Update AppBar control for high contrast

     Updates High Contrast colors for AppBar/ToolBar Commands
     - active state background, font and border colors for 'button', 'toggle' and 'flyout' typed primary and secondary commands
     - toggled state background, font and border colors for ""toggle"" typed primary commands.
     - menucommand active state background, font and border colors.

     The biggest challenge was to update the AppBar and ToolBar with a border when opened, without breaking existing styles for users who have migrated to 4.0. Rather than introducing a border that would eat up space in the ToolBar/AppBar content, we decided to introduce a border that overlays 1px of space on all sides of the actionarea and overflowarea elements.

     Listview uses a similar strategy for creating a border around selected elements without pushing the content or increasing the overall element size. Namely, create an element element with a transparent background and give it a solid border the border. Overlay the element completely over the element that you want to appear to give the appearance of having a border. The transparent element is given the CSS style ""pointer-events: none"" to prevent it from being a target for touch/mouse/pen interaction."

Some times none of the accent color rules work because they are generated
with an accent color value of 'undefined'. This is due to a race condition
in the accent color code: sometimes the accent color rules are generated
before the accent color has been retrieved.

The fix makes accent color retrieval synchronous. In addition to fixing
this race condition, it also fixes an issue where the accent color could
flash in. If it took a while to reach DOMContentLoaded, the user would
initially see the page rendered without accent color and then after
DOMContentLoaded, they'd see the page rendered with accent color. This is
doesn't happen anymore beacuse color retrieval no longer waits on
DOMContentLoaded."

Changes to SplitView:
  When opening with openedDisplayMode=overlay, the SplitView now gives
  initial focus to the whole pane rather than to the first element within
  the pane. This is what the onTakeFocus code does.

Changes to SplitViewPaneToggle
  When a SplitView is provided to the SplitViewPaneToggle (via splitView
  property), the SplitViewPaneToggle now sets a couple of accessibility
  properties:
    - aria-controls: Refers to SplitView's DOM element by ID.
    - aria-expanded: Boolean indicating whether or not the SplitView's
      pane is opened or closed. When Narrator modifies aria-expanded, the
      SplitViewPaneToggle keeps the SplitView in sync.

  One interesting detail this change raised is when to fire the invoked
  event. Here are all the possibilities:
    1. Button invoked with mouse/keyboard/touch
    2. Value of aria-expanded is changed
    3. SplitView pane's state changes
  I chose to only fire the invoked event for (1) because the invoked event
  is only expected to be used when a SplitView isn't provided and (2) and
  (3) are only relevant when a SplitView is provided. Plus, firing it for
  (1), (2), and (3) would probably be noisy since they affect each other."

     When the ToolBar is opened or closed, it reparents itself to or from the body. If the ToolBar had focus before re-parenting, it will lose focus in most browsers, to combat this the ToolBar will refocus itself after re-parenting.

     The problem is that when we refocus the ToolBar element during the  toolBar.open()  code path, the toolBar element has already been appended to the bottom of body element, but doesn't have its fixed position styles yet because its before we've applied the css class  .win-toolbar-opened . That's why no matter where the toolBar was on the page when you opened it, Some browsers like FF and Chrome instantly scroll all they way to the bottom of the page, and we see this bug.

     The fix is to focus the element after it has its proper CSS class applied."

     The problem was that the commandingSurface did not take always take into into account the possibility that commands could be hidden. When determining which commands to overflow, as soon as the commandingSurface would determine that a primaryCommand couldn't fit in the actionarea, that command and all additional commands with worse priority order in that sorted list would be projected into the overflowarea, regardless of their hidden state.

There are (at least) two wrong behaviors that this bug is tracking.
1) Showing a disposed Flyout is bad and causes the main bad behavior defined in this bug, where the empty flyout shows and can't be dismissed. This has been fixed so that showing a disposed flyout does not do anything.

2) CommandingSurface recently started disposing old MenuCommand projections whenever it creates new ones to fix a memory leak, but disposing ""content typed"" MenuCommands causes the MenuCommand to dispose its associated flyout. In this case the MenuCommands are disposing the CommandingSurface's content flyout. This has been fixed by unhooking the contentFlyout from the menuCommand before disposing it."

     Flyouts and Menu's have a max width of 456px defined in style redlines. This is makes full width flyouts and menu's too wide and they clip off the edge of the window since so many phones that are 480 physical pixels wide apply a zoom factor bringing them closer to 320px virtual pixels.

     Also corrected max and min width errors that were slightly off from what the redlines called for. Flyout and Menu should each have max-width border box of 456 px.

     The solution here is to use a media query to make the flyouts and menu's have max-width: 100vw when the media width is less than 456px"

Closes #994

 Previously Menu's have relied on the logic of placement ""right"" when cascading, meaning that each subMenu would appear to the right of the previous, regardless of the amount of available space on the right hand side or an RTL locale. This change contains the following changes to the cascading look and feel:

 - Tightened up the CSS to match the redlines, each new subMenu overlaps the previous by 4px subMenu, instead of the current implementation which had a 5px gap between each menu in the cascade.
 - The Cascade is RTL aware and prefers physical left instead of physical right when RTL is detected.
 - The horizontal placement logic has been updated to include 3 options when showing a new subMenu in the cascade:
 1. PREFERRED: When there is enough room to fit a subMenu on either side of the anchor,
 the subMenu prefers to go on the right hand side.
 2. FALLBACK: When there is only enough room to fit a subMenu on the left side of the anchor,
 the subMenu is placed to the left of the parent menu.
 3. LASTRESORT: When there is not enough room to fit a subMenu on either side of the anchor,
 the subMenu is pinned to the right edge of the window.
 - The vertical alignment logic has been updated to include 3 options when showing a new subMenu in the cascade:
 1. PREFERRED: When there is enough room to align a subMenu to either the top or the bottom of its anchor element,
 the subMenu prefers to be top aligned.
 2. FALLBACK: When there is enough room to bottom align a subMenu but not enough room to top align it,
 then the subMenu will align to the bottom of its anchor element.
 3. LASTRESORT: When there is not enough room to top align or bottom align the subMenu to its anchor,
 then the subMenu will center aligned to it's anchor's vertical midpoint."

This:

  var WinJS = require('winjs');

now works when using WinJS in a CommonJS environment (e.g. browserify).

All of the changes were in requirejs.js which generates the JavaScript at
the head and tail of base.js and ui.js.

To fix this:
  - ui had to declare its dependency on base.js CommonJS-style. ui.js now
    starts with the following code which declares its dependency on base for
    all module styles: AMD, CommonJS, and global/none:

    if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {
      // amd
      define([""./base""], factory);
    } else {
      if (typeof module !== 'undefined') {
        // CommonJS
	factory(require(""./base""));
      } else {
        // No module system
	factory(globalObject.WinJS);
      }
    }

  - ui and base had to publish their exports CommonJS-style. ui.js now
    ends with the following code which publishes its exports for all module
    styles: AMD, CommonJS, and global:

    // WinJS always publishes itself to global
    globalObject.WinJS = _WinJS;
    if (typeof module !== 'undefined') {
      // This is a CommonJS context so publish to exports
      module.exports = _WinJS;
    }
    return globalObject.WinJS;
  - js/ui.js is listed as ""main"" in package.json. Because ui.js depends on
    base.js, this will pull in all of WinJS.

I tested this change with browserify and webpack.

Note that WinJS bundles created with browserify currently lead to an
exception in the browser due to stray BOMs in the file. This is due to
substack/node-browserify#1263. It can be worked around by running
browserify with this flag: --no-detect-globals"

This is the last control that needed to be moved to the
LightDismissService. It's different in that all other controls are light
dismissable whereas this one is a modal (so many of the cues that cause a
light dismissable to dismiss (e.g. window blur, losing focus) do not cause
the ContentDialog to dismiss.

A bunch of functionality was moved from the ContentDialog into the
LightDismissService. What's nice is that you can concisely create a new
control which is a modal like this:

  this._dismissable = new _LightDismissService.ModalElement(
    element: this.element,
    tabIndex: -1,
    onLightDismiss: function () {
      this.hide();
    }.bind(this)
  );

Here's a summary of the changes:

ContentDialog
  - Edgy code was deleted because it's a deprecated feature.
  - ContentDialogManager was responsible for managing focus and
    coordination between dialogs. The LightDismissService now does this
    work.
  - Previously, you could only have 1 dialog shown at a time. Now, the
    LightDismissService enables you to show multiple dialogs at the same
    time. This also happens to fix #944.
  - These things were deleted because they're now handled by the
    LightDismissService:
    - Back click (hardware back button on phone)
    - beforeRequestingFocusOnKeyboardInput (type to search)
    - Focus handler for tracking and restoring focus
    - Key handlers which ensure that keyboard events don't escape the
      ContentDialog (for example, so you can't trigger the
      WinJS.UI.BackButton with a hotkey while the dialog is open)

LightDismissService
  - Edgy code was deleted because it's a deprecated feature.
  - Right-clicking on click eater now triggers a dismiss. Previously, it
    didn't because right-click triggered edgy (but now edgy is
    deprecated).
  - Added a LightDismissalPolicy for modals which describes which light
    dismiss cues should cause a modal to dismiss (only escape and hardware
    back button on phone)
  - ILightDismissable onActivate
    - Renamed to onTakeFocus because it was always used as a cue to for
      the dismissable to take focus when it became the active dismissable.
      However, we renamed it because we'd like to call it in one
      additional scenario: when the topmost dismissable loses focus but
      refuses to dismiss.
  - Added ILightDismissable onShow which gets called when a light
    dismissable gets put into the LightDismissService (i.e. calls
    LightDismissService.shown)
  - tryFocus was moved to _ElementUtilities._tryFocusOnAnyElement so other
    files can use it.
  - Added ModalElement which provides an implementation of
    ILightDismissable for modals. Much of its code was the same as
    LightDismissableElement so the common code was factored into
    AbstractDismissableElement and they both inherit from it.
  - A bunch of code for overriding default implementations of functions in
    LightDismissableElement/AbstractDismissableElement was deleted because
    it was just noise. In practice, only 4 things are ever overriden:
    element, tabIndex, onLightDismiss, and onTakeFocus.
  - Incorporated type to search handling
    (beforerequestingfocusonkeyboardinput) into LightDismissService. When
    any dismissable is shown, type to search it suppressed.
  - Propagating keyboard events in the light dismiss stack. When a modal
    is shown, we don't want key events to escape the modal and be seen by
    the body (e.g. hotkey for triggering WinJS.UI.BackButton). Imagine if
    a Flyout is shown by a ContentDialog. We still don't want the hotkeys
    to propagate. But the Flyout and ContentDialog are siblings in the DOM
    so the ContentDialog won't have the opportunity to eat the key events.
    We solve this by having all light dismissables send their key events
    to the LightDismissService and the service will send them to all
    dismissables so they'll all have the opportunity to handle them.
    Implementation-wise, this was done by
      - Adding keyDown, keyUp, and keyPress to the service. Light
	dismissables should call these when a key event occurs within
	them.
      - Adding onKeyInStack to ILightDismissable. The LightDismissService
	calls this on each dismissable when its propagating a key event
	down the light dismiss stack.

Flyout.js
  - Had to update _LightDismissableLayer because it is an
    ILightDismissable and we modified the ILightDismissable interface."

rigdern,2015-05-20 04:21:35,https://api.github.com/repos/winjs/winjs/git/commits/6e6390770cb365fcffec12f8544bcca4156af62c,6e6390770cb365fcffec12f8544bcca4156af62c,"Switch to new localization scheme #1101

First of all, it's important to note that the WinJS localization
infrastructure may search for localized strings in several ways:
  1a. WinRT. When WinRT is available, it asks it for localized strings.
  1b. window.strings. When WinRT is not available, WinJS looks up
      localized strings on a global variable called ""strings"". WinJS
      publishes on ""strings"" thru a file called js/en-US/ui.strings.js
      which is included in the WinJS build.
  2. When (1) fails, WinJS falls back to english strings which ship with
     WinJS (provided by base.js).

Here's a summary of this commit:
- manifest.resjson was deleted because it didn't appear to be used
  anywhere. It seems to be an artifact of the framework package.
- WinJS localized string path changed:
  - old: ms-resource://Microsoft.WinJS.4.0/ui/<someStringName>
  - new: ms-resource:///Microsoft.WinJS/ui/<someStringName>
  It didn't seem important to include the version number and it was easier
  to implement. Also, we need an extra slash at the beginning of the path
  because we're no longer a framework package.
- During the build, the localized strings are emitted in a separate
  directory called ""Microsoft.WinJS.4.0-strings"". This directory looks
  like this:
    Microsoft.WinJS.4.0-strings
      en-us
        Microsoft.WinJS.resjson
      de-de
        Microsoft.WinJS.resjson
      etc.
  Apps interested in being localized should include this directory in
  their VS project and remove any languages they are not interested in.
- Strings in resjson files must now be prefixed with ""ui/"". The framework
  package used to use namespacing to put stuff under ""ui/"". Because we're
  no longer a framework package, we can't take adavantage of official
  namespaceing so we prefix the WinJS strings with ""ui/"" to simulate
  namespacing.
- Consolidate to 1 english resjson file. Before we stored the english
  strings in several places and it was easy for them to fall out of sync:
  - src/js/en-US/ui.resjson
  - src/strings/EN-US/ui.json
  - src/strings/EN-US/appBarIcons.json

  The first one was used to produce ui.strings.js. It was also included in
  base.js as the source of the fall back english strings.

  The latter two weren't actually used yet. The plan was to feed them to
  WinRT along with all of the other languages in the ""src/strings"" folder.

  As of this commit, we only have a single english strings file
  (src/strings/en-us/Microsoft.WinJS.resjson) which serves all
  of the purposes (localization with WinRT, localization without WinRT,
  and english fallback strings that ship with WinJS)."

After disposing a ListView, when attempting to reuse its layout with a new
ListView, the new ListView doesn't render properly. Repros in browsers that
don't support CSS grid.

Here's a description of the problem and fix. Layouts can be reused. They
have 2 lifecycle methods: initialize and uninitialize. The problem here is
that the layout isn't properly cleaning up some state during uninitialize.
Specifically:
  - The layout should clear its envInfo.
  - The layout should remove the win-nocssgrid class from the surface

The former point is causing the symptom. The layout adds the win-nocssgrid
class to the ListView when it calculates envInfo but in the new ListView,
it already has envInfo so it never adds win-nocssgrid to it causing it to
render incorrectly."

In the past, all light dismissables derived from Overlay and Overlay
implemented all of the light dismiss logic. This model wasn't extensible
(i.e. it was hard to implement new light dismissables) so we created
LightDismissService which reimplements the light dismiss logic. This
change deletes the Overlay's light dismiss logic and connects the
Overlay-based light dismissables to the LightDismissService.

Here's the inheritance hierarchy for Overlay-based light dismissables:

- Overlay
  - Flyout
    - Menu
  - SettingsFlyout
  - LegacyAppBar

Here's a more detailed overview of the change:

With the LightDismissService, light dismissables are expected to take
focus before playing their show animation (by calling
LightDismissService.shown which will call onActivate) and they are
expected to relinquish focus at the end of their hide animation (by
calling LightDismissService.hidden which will call onActivate).

For a small example of connecting a control to the LightDismissService see
https://github.com/winjs/winjs/commit/be18db88ba2671257a6eab8dbba9286d200fe37b#diff-e9b46fea8fd9a25e479171eaa0fd77ad.

_Overlay.js
  - Deleted escape key handler because it now gets handled by the
    CascadeManager (Flyout.js).
  - Replace _endHide with _beforeEndHide. They are called at slightly
    different times (the latter after the element is invisible while the
    former is called before it's invisible) but they work equally well for
    our purpose.
  - Doesn't need to connect to LightDismissService because subclasses are
    responsible for that.
- SettingsFlyout.js
  - Deleted old light dismiss code
  - Connected to LightDismissService
  - SettingsFlyout now takes focus at the start of its show animation
    rather than at the end of it.
- LegacyAppBar.js
  - Deleted old light dismiss code
  - Connected to LightDismissService
  - Deleted AppBar coordination code. In Win 8 and 8.1, users used to be
    able to open and interact with multiple AppBars at the same time. The
    design has changed such that if multiple AppBars are open, you can
    only interact with the topmost one. All of the code for coordinating
    multiple AppBars was deleted because it's no longer needed and its
    existence was making connecting the AppBar to the LightDismissService
    more complicated.
- Flyout.js
  - Deleted old light dismiss code
  - Connected to LightDismissService
  - This was the most complicated Overlay to connect to the
    LightDismissService because you can have multiple Flyouts open
    simultaneously all above the click eater. This is what enables
    cascading menus. _LightDismissableLayer does most of the work of
    connecting to the LightDismissService.
- _LightDismissService.ts
  - Deleted requiresClickEater and OrderedCache. These were created for
    supporting sticky AppBar but we no longer need this code because
    sticky AppBar no longer exists.
  - Added getZIndexCount. This enables a light dismissable to have
    multiple z-indices allocated to it. It's used by Flyout.js for
    supporting cascading menus.
  - Use tryFocus helper instead of _ElementUtilities._tryFocus. The former
    is now used instead of the latter so that we can give focus to
    elements with a tabIndex of -1.
  - Added restoreFocus to LightDismissableElement which dismissables can
    make use of when overriding onActivate.
  - Added updated method. This enables dismissables to notify the
    LightDismissService when their getZIndexCount function is going to
    start returning a different value.

Tests
  - Changed
    ""testShowAndHideMovesFocusWithoutWaitingForAnimationToComplete"" to
    ""testShowMovesFocusSyncAndHideMovesFocusAsync"". As mentioned earlier
    in this commit message, show still moves focus before the animation
    but hide now moves focus after the animation.
  - ""checkShouldBeTabStop"" was breaking tests because it calls blur/focus
    which causes focus events in the middle of the tests which sometimes
    caused light dismissables to dismiss. Switched ""checkShouldBeTabStop""
    to an implementation which doesn't have side effects.
  - ""testBackClickEvent"" was tricky because Application.stop kills all
    event listeners on the Application object. Instead of worrying about
    this, we just trigger the LightDismissService's back click handler
    directly and take WinJS.Application out of the equation."

        Because the ToolBar takes up layout space and is not an overlay, it doesn't have the same expectation
              to move itself to get out of the way of a showing IHM. Instsead we just close the ToolBar to avoid
              scenarios where the ToolBar is occluded, but the click-eating-div is still present since it may seem
              strange to end users that an occluded ToolBar is eating their first click.

      Mitigation:
      Because (1) custom content in a ToolBar can only be included as a 'content' type command, because (2)
              the ToolBar only supports closedDisplayModes 'compact' and 'full', and because (3) 'content' type
              commands in the overflowarea use a separate contentflyout to display their contents:
              Interactable custom content contained within the ToolBar actionarea or overflowarea, will remain

During ListView's entrance/exit animation, we don't want to animate the
scrollbar. We solve this differently in different browsers:
  - IE: Animate the win-viewport and hide scrollbar with
    -ms-overflow-style:none (so that the scrollbar isn't animated).
  - Other browsers: Instead of hiding the scrollbar, we animate
    win-surface so that the scrollbar is visible but doesn't move.

The technique of animating win-surface causes a bug where items may be
positioned incorrectly because during the entrance/exit animation,
win-surface becomes the offsetParent of the win-containers. The ListView
is written under the assumption that win-viewport will always be the
offsetParent of the win-containers.

Specifically, this can be triggered by editing the ListView while it's
still playing its entrance animation so that the entrance animation and
editing animations are played at the same time. The repro from
https://github.com/winjs/winjs/issues/146#issuecomment-41634154 triggers
this.

To fix this, all browsers now:
  - Play the entrance/exit animation on win-viewport
  - Hide the scrollbar during the animation by setting overflow:hidden on
    win-viewport.

This change doesn't cause a measurable change in performance during the
entrance/exit animations."

A ""Container missing after updateContainers"" exception was thrown in the
following app scenario:
  - ListView is initialized with local data and a fetch is made to get the
    latest data from the server.
  - While the ListView is lazily creating containers, the server responds.
    The app replaces the local data in the ListView's data source with the
    data from the server. Specifically, this can be done by setting the
    Binding.List's length to 0 and pushing on the data from the server.

The problem was that the container creation set a cap at the current
number of containers + the change in the data source count. When doing a
direct replacement of the Binding.List's data, the count doesn't change so
updateContainers doesn't create any new containers. However, it receives a
number of notifications for items it hasn't created containers for yet
(because lazy container creation was still in progress). These items
require containers for animations. Because these items don't get
containers, the exception gets thrown.

The fix is to set the container creation cap at the current number of
containers + the number of inserted notifications we received (when lazy
container creation is in progress). This will ensure that updateContainers
creates enough containers for the animations."

At the start and end of editing animations, itemsblocks jump by the amount
of the win-container's top margin. The bug is due to the win-container's
top margin collapsing thru the win-itemcontainer during animations.
This margin collapsing only occurs during animations (due to
win-itemscontainer switching between overflow:hidden and visible). Whether
or not the margin collapsing is happening affects the size of the
win-itemscontainer which is what causes the jumping.

The fix is to prevent the margin collapsing from happening during
animations. The win-itemscontainer-padder prevents the margin collapsing
as long as it isn't display:none. Instead of styling display:none, we now
style height and width to 0. Consequently, win-itemscontainer-padder
prevents margin collapsing without taking up any space.

Most of the change was to update the tests to catch this bug. The
animation tests would have caught this bug if they verified the animation
state of a greater number of items. The changes included:
  - Verifying the size and position of all visible items (instead of just
    the deleted item)
  - Extending the height and width of the ListView so that more items fit
    on the screen.
  - Decreasing the number of items per group so that more groups fit on the
    screen.
  - Instead of making the deleted item the first or last element on the
    screen, put it closer to the middle of the screen so that there will
    be some items above it and some items below it that need to be
    animated.
  - Styling win-container's margin-top instead of margin-bottom (this is
    what we recommend to apps to avoid margin collapsing in vertical
    ListLayout).
  - Updated styling of win-itemscontainer's margins to reflect the fact
    that the defaults are never -200px anymore.

Deleted some dead test code."

    it a ::before pseudo-element. An additonal detail is that
    the pseudo-element is position: absolute. Consequently, its
    siblings need to be positioned (e.g. position: relative,
    absolute) and not position:static in order for them to be
    rendered in front of the pseudo-element.

Previously it was possible to get caught up in a perfect storm when you try to navigate while A flyout is showing and the virtual keyboard was up, such that the only way to avoid a crash after navigating was to preempt the virtual keyboard and hide the flyout before the keyboard starts hiding.

Now it is sufficient to prevent the crash by hiding the flyout after navigating, anytime before the virtual keyboard finishes hiding as opposed to before it starts hiding."

A second take on a fix for #637. The previous fix broke the scenario where you pass a parented promise to WinJS.UI.Pages.render().

This fix is less intrusive, but requires some work on the part of the developer to handle errors properly. This time the error value of Pages.render() has been modified to be an object that contains a reference to the Page itself. This way you can hook Page.readyComplete yourself and handle the error later:

WinJS.UI.Pages.render(location, element, state)
    .then(function (page) {
        console.log(""Pages.render complete"");
        return page.readyComplete;

This changes the behavior of WinJS.UI.Pages.render() so that the promise returned is the final promise chain constructed by the Page control.

Previously there was an issue of the render complete promise forking to call parentedPromise and Page.render(), so any issues during loading would propagate down that path as well and result in unhandled errors ending up in Application.onerror (triggering App termination) unless the developer added a custom Page.error() handler for each Page since the default error handler will blindly rethrow the error.

This means that functions chaining off Pages.render() will now get fired after ready has been called. It also means that in the navigation template specifying an invalid page to navigate to will no longer result in an app crash since all errors are handled by the cleanup() function."

     Some of the work that was done for 911630  includes:
     -Redline CSS updates.
     -""flyout "" typed MenuCcommands display a chevron to indicate that they invoke a sub flyout/menu
     - mouse hovering over a ""flyout"" typed MenuCommand for 400ms will inoke the associated sub Flyout/Menu.
     - unit tests

     The work for 911686  contains:
     - A new private singleton class in Flyout.js, ""CascadeManager"" is used to manage the lifespan of multiple open menus/flyouts at once.
     - Left arrow key will close the current subFlyout/subMenu and take you the parent menu. If there is only one Flyout/Menu showing, then left arrow key does nothing.
     - If a menu contains a ""flyout"" typed MenuCommand, the sub menu assoicated with that command can be invoked with the right arrow key when that command is focused.
     - Pressing either ""Alt"" or ""F10"" inside of a flyout/menu will close all open Flyouts/Menus.
     - Showing a flyout/menu whose anchor HTMLElement is inside of a currently shown flyout/menu, will append the showing flyout to the cascade as a child of the  flyout that contains the anchor element.
     - Showing a flyout/menu whose anchor HTMLElement is not inside of any currently shown flyout/menu will close all currently shown flyout/menus in the cascade and place the new showing flyout/menu at the head of a new cascade.
     - Refactoring a lot of the event handling policy from MenuCommand.js into the Menu.js
     - More unit tests

There will be at least two more checkins before the complete feature is completed.
     Still left to do:
     - Enable new selection styling for 'flyout' typed MenuCommands to indicate which MenuCommand in a parent Menus has invoked the current open sub menu.
     - Enable smart positioning for cascading flyouts/menus."

Disposing a hidden ContentDialog would lead to an exception which would
cause the app to terminate.

Here's why. When disposing a hidden dialog, the dialog would put the show
promise into an error state. Because the dialog wasn't showing, nobody
outside of the dialog would have a reference to the show promise so nobody
could handle the error promise. Thus, the promise error would remain
unhandled and lead to app termination.

The fix is to only create the show promise when somebody asks for it by
calling the show() function.

To catch this kind of mistake in the tests, added initUnhandledErrors and
validateUnhandledErrors to all of the ContentDialog tests.

Also, removed overflow:hidden from the dialog's title so that low hanging
letters don't get clipped (clipping used to be needed when we wanted to
limit the number of lines of text in the title)."

When using a horizontal Hub, it is best practice to specify all section
widths in CSS for performance reasons.

However, developers may choose to have a section whose width depends on
its content. In this case, the section may change width during
WinJS.UI.processAll (e.g. if the section contains a Repeater). In this
scenario, to reliably restore a scroll position after a navigation, the
developer should wait for the Hub to fire loadingState=complete.

The bug was setting scrollPosition in loadingState=complete didn't work
because the Hub had the sizes of the sections before they were processed
rather than afterwards (so it would clamp the desired scroll position
incorrectly).

The fix is for the Hub to invalidate its measurements before firing
loadingState=complete if a section changed size during processing."

Because Firefox doesn't support ""focusin"" and ""focusout"" natively, our _ElementUtilities._addEventListener WinJS code today will fire synthetic ""focusin"" & ""focusout"".

Because we anchor these to the native focus and blur events, we fire our synthetic events asynchronously in IE and syncronously in every other browser. This change has us anchor our synthetic events to the native ""focusin"" and ""focusout"" where its supported (everywhere but firefox), otherwise ""focus"" and ""blur"".  The net effect is that we should get synchronous synthetic ""focusin"" and ""focusout"" events for every browser we support."

putting a SearchBox inside of the SplitView's content.

To avoid this, the SplitView's pane and content are each given a z-index
so that:

     them.
  2. The pane element is always rendered on top of the content element."

Functionality implemented:
  - layout of pane and content for overlay and inline display modes
  - events (beforeshow, aftershow, beforehide, afterhide)
  - animations (showPane, hidePane)
  - An equivalent of _Base._lazy for SplitView which is implemented in
    TypeScript. A non-toplevel require is used in place of _Base._lazy.
  - Unit tests for SplitView initialization, property manipulation,
    events, and animations.

Other changes:
  - amd.js: Added support for non-toplevel requires
  - _TransitionAnimation.js: Extended fast animations API so that we can
    have slow animations for debugging and non-PVL animations can adjust
    their timing accordingly.
  - Animation.js: Added a private resize animation.
  - Added require.d.ts for require.js so that we can do requires (not to
    be confused with import-requires) in TypeScript.
  - Added SplitView to winjs.d.ts."

We have changed the scope of item striping to only apply to WinJS list and grid layouts as well as any custom layouts that opt in to using structural nodes by setting Layout.numberOfItemsPerItemsBlock. This checkin changes our List and Grid Layouts behavior when we detect known bugs with nested flexbox scenarios in the browsing enviornment to always use structural nodes, so that those layouts can continue to reparent items into containers whenever edits happen, with reparenting being the prerequisite to preserving item striping after edits without compromising performance.

Normally our List and Grid layouts will put all of the items of a group into several win-itemblocks elements with, each itemsblock containing a handful of items. The itemsblocks are in turn put into a  single win-itemscontainer element which contains all the itemsblocks and items for that group.  Our List and Grid layouts will then make both the itemscontainer element and the itemsblocks elements display:flex.

However some browsers do not display nested flex boxes correctly, and has a result, our layouts when detecting these bugs exists, have had been forgoing itemsblocks entirely, putting all of the win-items directly into the win-itemscontainer, leaving the win-itemscontainer as the only display:flex element.  With this change we now handle bugs with nested flexboxes by putting one giant itemsblock into the itemscontainer element, putting all of the win-items of a group into the single itemsblock, making the itemscontainer display:block, and let the itemsblock element be the display:flex element."

Summary of changes:

- ContentDialog
  - Update accent color
  - Add doc comments for DismissalReason
  - Use aria-flowfrom/flowto to cause Narrator to caurosel rather than
    leaving dialog
  - Make ContentDialog more aggressive about eating keys
    - Goal: app hotkeys won't work (e.g. alt+left arrow to trigger the WinJS
      back button) but browser hotkeys will (e.g. ctrl+n for a new browser
      window)
  - Suppress SearchBox's type to search feature while a ContentDialog is
    showing by canceling WinJS.Application's
    beforeRequestingFocusOnKeyboardInput event
  - Suppress edgy while a ContentDialog is showing
- WinJS.Application
  - Add support for stopImmediatePropagation
  - Wrap the edgy WinRT events so that they can be suppressed
  - Wrap the type to search WinRT event (requestingfocusonkeyboardinput)
    so that it can be suppressed
    - Did this as 2 events (beforerequestingfocusonkeyboardinput and
      requestingfocusonkeyboardinput). Mark former as handled to suppress
      the latter. The WinRT requestingfocusonkeyboardinput fires on every
      key press so this was implemented carefully so that
      WinJS.Application only registers for the event if somebody is
      interested in handling it.
- SearchBox implements type to search in JavaScript when the WinRT API
  isn't available. This implementation was moved into WinJS.Application
  and exposed via WinJSApplication's requestingfocusonkeyboardinput event
- SearchBox now consumes WinJS.Application's type to search event instead
  of the WinRT one
- AppBar and Overlay now consume WinJS.Application's edgy events instead
  of the WinRT ones"

Summary of changes:

- When a dialog has only one button, make it right-aligned and half the
  width of the dialog.
- Exposed dispatchEvent on WinJS.Application as _dispatchEvent so that
  tests can fire Application events synchronously.
- Input & focus management
  - Connect escape key and hardware back button to hide
  - Eat pointer events and clicks
  - Restore focus when dialog is dismissed
  - Prevent focus from escaping the dialog. Monitor all focus moves and
    if one is outside of the dialog, put focus back inside the dialog.
    But allow focus to move into Flyouts.
  - Avoid leaks when listening to events on global objects. Apply the
    _ElementUtilities._globalListener pattern to WinJS.Application and
    document.documentElement.
- API changes:
  - CSS class name changes
    - win-contentdialog-body -> win-contentdialog-dialog
    - win-contentdialog-dimcontent -> win-contentdialog-backgroundoverlay
    - win-contentdialog-content is now public
    - win-contentdialog-commands is now public
  - Property changes
    - isPrimaryCommandDisabled -> primaryCommandDisabled
    - isSecondaryCommandDisabled -> secondaryCommandDisabled
    - Exposed enum WinJS.UI.ContentDialog.DismissalReason"

 Wired handling for WinJS.Application's ""backpressed"" event into _Overlay family of WinJS.UI controls.

  Refactored some code in the _Overlay light dismiss path to make readability and future modifications easier.
  Fixed a systemic Overlay issue where the element in some instances of _Overlay derivative classes still could not recieve programatic focus in non IE browsers. (div's require tabIndex -1).
  Refactored global _Overlay event handler handlers into a mechanism that allows for easy resets to aid unit test scenarios and provide better interoperability with Application.stop()"

Hub headers are designed to receive focus thru their button elements.
However, Safari has special focus behavior for buttons such that they can
only be focused programmatically (so clicking on a button doesn't give it
focus).

To allow users to focus headers in Safari by clicking on them, a div
within the header was made focusable by giving it a tabindex of -1. Also,
this div was given an outline of none to hide Safari's default blue focus
outline. This is similar to the technique used by AppBar commands."

NavBar was using the IE only event beforeactivate to control which element

an instance of TabContainer.

The behavior of tabbing into a NavBarCommand was changed slightly.
Previously, when you tabbed in, the button or the split button received
focus depending on which one was last active. Now when tabbing in, the
button always receives focus (and the split button never does). This was
done to avoid the complications of introducing a TabContainer into the
NavBarCommand. As a result, the split button now has a tabindex of -1
instead of 0 and all references to _splitButtonActive were removed.

The root cause of the panning performance issues we see in iOS is that we don't get scroll events/or an accurate scroll values while there is inertia, so our virtualization code does not know what items to realize.

We evaluated different options:
-Do nothing
-Remove inertia (by stop setting -webkit-overflow-scroll: touch)
-Fake scrolling with translate and animations. We evaluated two libraries (1) iScroll: winjs-ebang.azurewebsites.net/iscroll/listview.html 2) Scrollability: http://winjs-ebang.azurewebsites.net/scrollability/listview.html, and it look ""good/ok"" on an iPad Air, but not so well on an iPhone 4s (which is still supported for iOS 8)
-Use larger prefetch buffer: a) no virtualization b) larger front buffer

We decided to go with the last option. This change introduces two private flags that allow us to configure the number of pages ahead/behind the scrolling direction that we want to prefetch. It is currently enabled only in iOS, and the default values are 2 behind, 6 ahead of the panning direction.

You can play with the values of these flags here: http://winjs-ebang.azurewebsites.net/lvlistlayout.html

Before:
http://winjs-ebang.azurewebsites.net/lvlistlayout-prehover.html

After:
http://winjs-ebang.azurewebsites.net/lvlistlayout.html

Demo: http://1drv.ms/1pD0F6T

Note: iOS still allows you to scroll huge amount of pixels (thousands), in those cases, we will still see backdrops (the only option would be huge prefetch buffers which would have memory implications).  We should call out that even in the iOS AppStore, you are able to see blankness on fast-scrolls: http://1drv.ms/1pD0Mzl"

Due to Chrome and Firefox flexbox bugs, the surface isn't sized to

--

When the ListView is invisible or not in the DOM during construction,
envInfo fails to be calculated and we never retry. To fix this, envInfo is
now calculated during measuring. Also, envInfo should only be used after
measuring has succeeded.

--

During measuring in flexbox mode (as opposed to CSS grid),
groupheadercontainers and itemscontainers are sized to their parent rather
than their content. To fix this, the surface is given
align-items:flex-start during measuring.

--

A couple of HorizontalListTests relied on a race condition (ListView will
have rendered its items after a requestAnimationFrame). This was fixed by
waiting for loadingState=viewPortLoaded following a scroll. Afterwards,
the tests were too slow because they scrolled too many times. The tests
were sped up by picking a few key scroll positions to test against."

There were a few problems:
- ListView styles in unit test had to be updated to account for the
  default -200px padding (the test's styles assumed the default padding
  was 0).
- Our technique of using win-proxy to prevent margin collapsing between
  the win-surface and the win-groupheadercontainer does not work in
  Safari. Fixed this by taking advantage of Safari's
  -webkit-margin-collapse CSS attribute.
- When a group header was unvirtualized, the win-groupheadercontainer was
  collapsing causing all of the items to shift. The fix is to set the size
  of the scrolling dimension of the win-groupheadercontainers for inline
  headers (width for horizontal layouts, height for vertical layouts).
  This matches what the layouts do when using CSS grid."

Cell spanning tests were running in Safari despite it not supporting CSS
grid. The problem is that Safari CSSStyleDeclarations have a property for
grid-column (specifically, -webkit-grid-column) despite the CSS engine
ignoring such attributes.

This was fixed by switching to a platform specific check for CSS grid
(checking for the existence of -ms-grid-row). This means that ListView
will only use CSS grid in IE. This is probably what we want because the
ListView's use of CSS grid is based on IE 10/11's implementation. If other
browsers were to implement CSS grid, ListView would have be updated anyway
to make use of the latest CSS grid standard."

Most of the problems stemmed from WWA/IE implementing pointer events while
other browsers implement touch events. The only touch events that seem to
be implemented consistently are:
  - touchstart
  - touchend
  - touchmove

Tooltip relies on pointerover and pointerout for:
  - Showing a tooltip when the user presses and holds on a tooltip element
  - Showing a tooltip when the user hovers their finger onto a tooltip
    element
  - Hiding a tooltip when the user hovers their finger off of a tooltip
    element

There aren't any touch event equivalents for pointerover or pointerout. So
the first scenario was achieved in other browsers by also having
pointerdown (touchstart) show a tooltip. There isn't a good way to
implement the other 2 scenarios without pointerover/out so the other 2
scenarios do not work in other browsers. We are okay with this.

The unit tests which fired pointerover/out had to be modified to fire
alternative events in browsers that don't have pointer events.

--

When a tooltip is triggered, the control notes which input method
triggered the tooltip (_showTrigger). Before this change, when multiple
input methods triggered a tooltip, the control remembered the last method.
This was changed slightly so that it remembers the first method instead.

--

Our translation table used touchleave as the touch equivalent of
pointerout. Because touchleave has different semantics than pointerout and
nobody is currently relying on pointerout mapping to touchleave,
pointerout no longer maps to touchleave. When somebody needs pointerout,
we can think more about the appropriate touch equivalent.

--

Most of the other changes were around adjusting the unit test assertions
to account for slight differences in the return values of the CSS APIs of
the browsers."

Tests were failing in browsers that don't support mselementresize.

Developers who resize a NavBar element should call forceLayout on it so
the resize is detected in browsers which do not support mselementresize.

NavBar also resizes when the window is resized in all browsers.

So the resize tests were updated as follows:
  - If the browser supports mselementresize, we do nothing other than
    resize the element. Otherwise, we fire a window resize event.
  - Each resize test was duplicated to call forceLayout after changing the
    element's size. These tests run in all browsers. They test the scenario
    that the developer wants to change the size of the NavBar without
    changing the size of the window."

NavBarContainer had to be given an explicit tabIndex of -1 otherwise it

Many of the tests checked that the NavBarContainer received focus
immediately after calling .focus on it. This was removed beacuse:
  - It was unnecessary. NavBarContainer only had focus temporarily. Focus
    quickly moved to a command within the NavBar. Each test already
    verified that the command received focus a little later so this check

Update the zoomTo polyfill to do an animated scroll instead of just
setting the scroll position. The implementation works by repeatedly
updating the scroll position using requestAnimationFrame.

The _setActive polyfill also had to be updated. Behind the scenes,
_setActive calls .focus() which causes a scroll. When using _zoomTo and
_setActive together, _setActive caused a jarring jump prior to the
_zoomTo's smooth animated scroll. This was fixed by giving _setActive the
ability to hold one scroller steady for use in this scenario. A number of
_setActive helpers had to be updated to pass around the scroller that
should be held steady.

Hub and NavBar were updated to ensure that their viewports don't scroll
when calling _setActive. They're the only controls that use zoomTo."

When both currentIndex and maxRows are set in the NavBar's constructor,
currentIndex is usually ignored.

The problem is that after the NavBar measures, it sets the height of the
surface which triggers the resize handler. The resize handler sets
currentIndex to 0 thus overriding the value that was passed into the
constructor.

The fix is to only run the resize handler when the NavBar's size really
did change.

Additionally, the NavBarContainer's focus state (including focus,
currentIndex, and scroll position) should be reset when the NavBar is
hidden and then reshown. The NavBarContainer used to fulfill this
requirement indirectly thru its resize handler (the resize handler is
triggered when when the NavBar goes from display=""none"" to ""block""). Now
that the NavBarContainer's resize handler only runs if its viewport's size
has changed since the last measure, we need a more explicit way to reset
the focus state when the NavBar is hidden and then reshown. This
requirement is now fulfilled by calling closeSplitAndReset when NavBar
fires its beforeshow event."

This is one of the unit tests referenced in #117   that is failing cross browser. When an AppBar is opened, the AppBar moves focus to the first AppBar command in DOM Order, however if the AppBar is empty, it focuses itself.

According to the HTML5 spec, DIV's with no tabIndex set should not be focusable through tabbing, pointerDown, or the element.focus() API. However, in IE a DIV with no tabIndex is able to be focused by pointerDown or the element.focus() API.
Other modern browsers seem to get the behavior in the spec correct, so in those browsers the AppBar is not able to focus itself because since no tabIndex is set, and this unit test fails.

The fix is to check if the user has specified a tabIndex on the element already during the AppBar constructor. If they have not, we explicitly set a tabIndex of -1, which means that an element is not focusable through tabbing, but is focusable through pointerDown and the element.focus() API."

With nested flexboxes, the inner flexbox's width is proportional to the
number of elements instead of the number of columns.

To work around this, we disable structural nodes for environments that
would repro this bug. Disabling structural nodes prevents us from having
nested flexboxes."

All blur/focusout and focus/focusin events were replaced with custom WinJS
events by registering via WinJS.Utilities._addEventListener for focusout
and focusin, respectively. These custom events bring IE's native
focusout/focusin behavior to other browsers. Specifically:
  1. They ensure that document.activeElement is set appropriately within
     focusout handlers. In Chrome's native focusout,
     document.activeElement is always BODY which isn't very useful.
  2. They work in Firefox even though it doesn't support focusin/focusout
     natively.
  3. They allow handlers to determine who lost focus and who is gaining
     focus. Native blur/focus only provide half of this information.

Also, we have some code in the unit tests which generates keyboard events.
It generates UIEvents but the keyCode property of a UIEvent is not
settable in Chrome. To fix this, switched to CustomEvent so that we can
override the keyCode property."

setImmediate doesn't exist in other browsers. Generally, we use setTimeout
0 as a fallback. In the case of the scheduler, we use setTimeout 16 as a
fallback since the goal is to give the host the opportunity to complete
some work.

The reasons for the use of setImmediates can be divided into a few
categories. They are given different names so that we can tweak the
implementations as needed:
  1. Yield for events. Allows the browser to finish dispatching its
     current set of events before running the callback.
  2. Yield for DOM modifications. Allows the browser to notice a DOM
     modification before running the callback.
  3. Move to the scheduler. Some setImmediates didn't have a reason for
     using it and so were moved to the scheduler:
     - Lazily clean up DOM weak reference table.
     - The ItemContainer schedules some work to give the caller of the
       constructor the opportunity to synchronously put the control into
       the DOM.
     - The Pivot schedules some work to avoid re-entrancy.
  4. The rest didn't fit into a category and use a generic _setImmediate
     helper."

BUILD:Two changes to improve spec correctness and fix behavior on Chrome.
