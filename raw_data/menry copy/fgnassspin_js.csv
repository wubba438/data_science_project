Directly applying a box-shadow to the spinner lines would cause the shadow to be rotated along with the lines, which doesn't look natural. Previously, this was avoided by generating another element for each line, coloring it black and applying a black box-shadow, and then positioning it down a couple pixels beneath the line. However, this approach didn't allow customization of the shadow position and color, and also blocked use of inset shadows or multiple blended shadows with different positions.

This commit solves these issues by parsing a standard box-shadow value to determine its x and y offsets, and then using trigonometry to correct the shadow coordinates for each line based on its degrees of rotation.

Native CSS scaling is now used so that shadows will be scaled along with the lines as expected.

* Replaced dynamic CSS keyframe animations with `requestAnimationFrame`
    * This adds support for Content Security Policy ""style-src 'self';"" option (resolves #115, resolves #229)
    * Fixes janky animation appearance in Microsoft Edge (resolves #342)
    * Fixes missing line with trail set to 100 in IE (resolves #327)
    * Animation logic is now unified in all browsers
* Library is now distributed as an ES6 module (closes #341, fixes #340)
* Removed useless `hwaccel` option
* Dropped IE 6-8 support and removed VML fallback since it isn't needed for IE 9+
* Moved internal functions out of Spinner instance
* Removed minified files from bundle
* Removed jQuery plugin (closes #325)
* Dropped bower/composer/component/spm support. Install from npm instead (recommended), or save spin.js file in your repo.
* Updated website to use native range inputs rather than polyfill, and remove jQuery usage
* Added CONTRIBUTING.md file

Version 3.0 does not change the public Spinner API, so if you are already using a module bundler such as Webpack or Rollup, upgrading should be as easy as adding the following ES6 module import:

```javascript
import {Spinner} from 'spin.js';
```"
