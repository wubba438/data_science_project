* Prevent multiple NotificationService instances

* Added null check for getView() prevents crash
Amount of steps to search read from prefs
Zoom in map animation only for first time

* Prevent  java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

* Removed unnecessary call; there is an Activity in the back

* Sleep timer calculated properly now (missed * 1000) so actually did only wait milliseconds. Uff.
Added initial sleep timer to prevent UpdateRunnable calling getCatchablePokemon() directly after invoke (get shortly invoked and shuts down then when resuming from Settings for example) -- using this initial sleep and proper calculated timing we might fix the EventBus issues as well.

* - Map suggestion remembers that it was closed. So it doesn't show up again after restart.
- After returning from SettingsActivity the map does not zoom like crazy. It just returns to the last known location (that why its static now)
- Initial search after login still zooms in. Now the initial search uses the  step range configured in the settings!"
