libxml2 >= 2.9.2 fails to escape comments within some attributes. It
wants to ensure these comments can be treated as ""server-side includes"",
but as a result fails to ensure that serialization is well-formed,
resulting in an opportunity for XSS injection of code into a final
re-parsed document (presumably in a browser).

the offending commit is:

  https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2/commit/960f0e2

we'll test this by parsing the HTML, serializing it, then
re-parsing it to ensure there isn't any ambiguity in the output
that might allow code injection into a browser consuming
""sanitized"" output.

complaints have been made upstream about this behavior, notably at

  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769760

and multiple CVEs have been declared and fixed in downstream
libraries as a result, a list is being kept up to date here:

  commit 45ea7fc4554ee2f39f0a301346f7bd24108c8228

  Date:   Thu May 26 11:38:28 2016 +0200

      Consider built-in templates in apply-imports

      The XSLT specification says about the built-in templates: ""The built-in
      template rules are treated as if they were imported implicitly before
      the stylesheet and so have lower import precedence than all other
      template rules.""

      That means that the apply-imports instruction needs to consider
      built-in templates, as ""xsl:apply-imports processes the current node
      using only template rules that were imported into the stylesheet
      element"".

To use the same C compiler with the Ruby.
If they are different, it may cause an issue.

For example a FreeBSD environment which has gcc and libiconv from
pkg/ports, which are installed in /usr/local.
The normal Ruby installation uses cc (clang).
But when nokogiri runs extconf.rb, libxml uses gcc by its configure,
and it uses libiconv (-liconv), instead of FreeBSD libc's iconv
because port's gcc sees /usr/local by default.
Then extconf.rb runs have_library('xml2', 'xmlParseDoc', 'libxml/parser.h')
but it fails to find -liconv because extconf.rb's try_compile uses
Ruby's CC (cc) and which doesn't see /usr/local."

This was introduced due to https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1196
and https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1208 .

However it turned out, that the change in libxml-2.9.2 was a regression, that was
fixed in: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=737840 and libxml-2.9.3.

If I read the libxml sources right, it seems, that xmlDocCopyNode() is not
intended to emit any such warnings at all. Only errors leading to a failure
of the function are emitted. However these errors should be reported to ruby
space in the form of exceptions (this is not yet implemented - currently either
nil is returned or a generic error text is raised).

This patch also synchronizes the behavior on MRI to that of JRuby, so that
the error list is filled from the parser only and that it is shared after
Document#dup ."

This depends on a fixed version of mini_portile in regards to the handling
of configure_options. I therefore assigned a git link in the Gemfile, temporary.

Rubys stdlib shellwords is generelly an issue on Windows. It's sadly, but Windows
uses several different ways to escape command line options. While shellwords mostly
works in Msys bash (and therefore in a Makefile), it is completely wrong in cmd.exe
or msvcrt based programs. It's annoying, but escape rules in mkmf.rb functions
(like try_compile etc) are different to that of $CPPFLAGS etc. which run in a

libxml-ruby uses the global libxml2 callback xmlDeregisterNodeDefault.

This callback looks in the _private field for every deleted libxml2
node. If the _private field is set, it is treated as a Ruby VALUE ptr.
The callback NULLs the Ruby object's data pointer and mark & free fn
pointers.

When Nokogiri wraps a libxml2 document it puts a nokogiriTuple ptr
in the _private field. We can't let the libxml-ruby callback be
invoked on a libxml2 document before NULLing the document _private
field.

When Nokogiri wraps other libxml2 nodes it puts VALUE ptrs in the
_private field. This makes the libxml-ruby callback generally safe for
these node types.

There is a caveat - it is unsafe to access VALUE ptrs during GC sweep.

This commit tests whether the xmlDeregisterNodeDefault callback is set
during document cleanup. If set, we traverse the document and clean up
all _private fields.

The previous solution was to unset xmlDeregisterNodeDefault callback.
However, this doesn't work in multithreaded environments."

Previously, it was possible to ""add"" a text node to another text node
thanks to the special feature implemented in xmlAddChild().  However,
because reparent_node_with() was not aware of it, such an operation
could cause a SEGV.

Our JRuby version does not support it anyway, so the CRuby counterpart
now explicitly inhibits it from now on.

Depending on the ScriptingContainer each thread may or may not have its
own runtime. Which means the last runtime that initializes Nokogiri will
insert its RubyClass instances in our class cache. This will cause all
the other threads to see weird behavior as Nokogiri fails to lookup ruby
classes properly. This fix makes the class cache an internal variable
per in the Nokogiri module. Thus, we'll have one cache per runtime

The fix for #719 made ReferenceEntity nodes look like text nodes. This
caused normalization of the document (i.e. concatenating adjacent
nodes) to combine the reference entity node with any adjacent text
nodes and create a new text node. When converting the document to
a string it was impossible to know if the text came from a reference
entity or text node, or both, which caused entities to be printed
without the delimiters '&' and ';'."

It turns out that the missing closing tags was caused by an encoding
exception and misuse of the Encoder API. The exception was due to
the &raquo; entity which isn't supported by the Shift_JIS encoding
which caused the encoder to stop half way while it's converting the
UTF-16 content of the document to Shift_JIS. To fix this, we convert
all characters not supported by the current encoding to html entities."

DocumentFragment parsing which depends on Xml::Node::parse didn't
properly handle namespaces in context. Ideally we should be using
Xerces parsing with a hint to the context node, but unfortunately
this feature isn't implemented yet
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1429 which is why we
manually add namespace declarations to the fake root that encapsulates
the document fragment."

The Java and C extensions are showing discrepancies when formatting xml: when using the `noblank` option, text nodes are indented and put on a newline by the Java extension, whereas the C one favours a compact approach with no whitespace nor indentation around the text node.  This commit forces the Java extension to behave like the C extension by *never* indenting and “newlining” the text nodes, whether `noblank` is used or not — in line with the observed C extension behaviour."

I had to mangle the test a little bit, because it looks like Java is capable of detecting the errors at instantiation, but libxslt detects them at first-use. So the block in the test needed to be expanded to cover both cases.

This commit also fixes a bug in the Java code where a ruby exception was being created but not thrown when the XSLT document creation failed.

In order to provide the user with actual useful feedback in Java, the NokogiriXsltErrorListener will need to be modified to record more than the last error message."

The doc pointer on an xmlNode is not always an xmlDoc. The child of a document
fragment will point to the document fragment, which does not behave exactly
like an xmlDoc and doesn't have a nokogiriTuple.

This changeset tests for XML_DOCUMENT_FRAG_NODE before assuming that the doc
pointer is an xmlDoc.

This changes the NOKOGIRI_ROOT_NODE and NOKOGIRI_ROOT_NSDEF macros to functions
which test for this case.

Also check for this case in Nokogiri_wrap_xml_node.

This changeset adds a unit test which was copied from Kristi's bug report.

Note that this simply omits the case where we are inserting a previous
text sibling, and our case was duping and unparenting the *next* text
sibling.

It's not totally clear to me, based on looking at the libxml2 code,
that this is necessary if the pivot node is not a text node. That is,
we may be being *too* defensive here.

We should probably schedule some work to rethink all the kludges we
have around node reparenting, because I'm pretty sure we can simplify
(or decompose) `reparent_node_with` with a little thought."

I tried to parse the not well-formed XSLT template as HTML document fragment and create XML document from the HTML fragment. This attempt succeeded.

However, the attempt caused another problem. The ""test_xslt_parse_error"" wouldn't raise an error as expected anymore. The test expects RuntimeError when XSLT template is not well-formed.

When evaluating an xpath, we get a set of nodes and, potentially,
namespaces. The nodes are pointers to document nodes which will be
freed automatically at document deallocation.

The namespaces, however, belong to the xpath evaluation and it is
our responsibility to free them. At deallocation time we don't
know whether the document has been freed already, and it is unsafe
to traverse the node list to free our namespaces.

This fixes the issue by creating a separate list of namespaces and
freeing them at deallocation time.

An attempt at plugging this leak was made with commit dbda52b and
reverted with commit eacd089"

In xslt_stylesheet.c, the method parse_stylesheet_doc() gives libxslt an error
callback and then invokes xsltParseStylesheetDoc.

Nokogiri's error callback invokes rb_exc_raise() which prevents the function
from returning to the caller. As a result libxslt never cleans up after itself
and we leak memory.

Additionally, xsltParseStylesheetDoc requires that the caller frees the XML
document on failure.

This commit fixes both of the above issues. Note one side effect -- we no longer
provide the exact reason for the parser failure in the exception. I added
rb_warning() to the error callback so that the error can be seen when Ruby is
running with $VERBOSE.

I wrote up description of how I found and fixed this leak at:

If an IO object returns a string that is longer than expected, io_read_callback() writes past the limit of the buffer and crashes the interpreter. This patch checks against the size of our buffer before copying the data over.

I can't really think of a case where an IO object would do something this silly, but seems like a good practice anyways."

REE uses tcmalloc by default, but on OS X libc's vasprintf() allocates
memory with the system's malloc() function instead of tcmalloc's. If we
were to free its result with tcmalloc's free(), it will cause a crash.
This commit makes use of REE system_free() function to free vasprintf()
results. More info: https://github.com/FooBarWidget/rubyenterpriseedition187-330/blob/release/system_allocator.c

Some functions also leak string memory if an exception is raised. This
patch makes sure those strings are freed no matter what."

This example will use up all system memory:

  require 'nokogiri'

  class BadIO
    def read(*args)
      raise 'hell'
    end
  end

  100000000.times do
    Nokogiri::XML.parse(BadIO.new) rescue nil
  end

The example above is obscure, but imagine an HTTP object raising TimeoutError. Nokogiri leaks memory every time this happens.

I became suspicious of this when looking at ext/nokogiri/xml_io.c. io_read_callback() is invoked in the middle of some libxml operation, which may not behave well when a ruby exception is thrown and it gets interrupted. It seems that the safe way to handle this is to wrap the method call in rb_rescue.

Note that the same applies to io_write_callback() in xml_io.c. Although I did not notice a memory leak with io_write_callback(), wrapping with rb_rescue() seems like the correct thing to do in both cases.

A side effect of this fix is that IO errors will be silently discarded."

* master: (225 commits)
  updating changelog
  supporting :has() selectors. closes #172
  FFI: cleanup. closes #65.
  adding tests for soap4r adapter and bugfixes.  closes #167
  FFI: fixing warning
  Use FFI::Buffer instead of FFI::MemoryPointer for small, transient native->ruby transfers
  For some functions, the :pointer arg is only needed to return a pointer or int value, so restrict the copy direction so a Buffer can be used more efficiently.
  Pointer#null? returns a boolean, so just use it instead of testing it and returning explicit true/false
  Use Pointer#get_array_of_string() instead of hand-rolled loop
  Pass callbacks as a block, instead of creating a lambda, to lessen load on GC
  memoize POINTER_SIZE, so pointer_offset(n) is not doing a type lookup each call
  adding collect namespaces back in
  implementing Node#previous_element
  expanding tests for Node#next_element and fixing a boog.

Read carefully the following letter I received today:

** WHY ALL THOSE _if Nokogiri.uses_libxml?_ **
Hi, my dear readers,

After reading these tests you may be wondering why all those ugly
if Nokogiri.uses_libxml? sparsed over the whole document. Well, let
me explain it. While using XPath in Java, you need the extension
functions to be in a namespace. This is not required by XPath, afaik,
but it is an usual convention though.

Furthermore, CSS does not support extension functions but it does in
Nokogiri. Result: you cannot use them in JRuby impl. At least, until
the CSS to XPath parser is patched, and let me say that there are more
important features to add before that happens. I hope you will forgive
me.

Yours truly,

The guy whose headaches belong to Nokogiri JRuby impl."

instead of _private, we're now using a class-level hash to track
(node => object) relationships.

however, we have to be careful not to store the actual object, because
then GC will consider the object to still be in use and never GC it.

further, we can't use the WeakRef class, because lots of tests fail
due to type-iness (I should probably look closer at why, exactly --
isn't WeakRef supposed to Just Work?).

so the end result is we store the object id in the hash, and use
ObjectSpace._id2ref() to retrieve the object reference when we need
it."
