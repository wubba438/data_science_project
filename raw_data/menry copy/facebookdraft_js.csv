Summary:
Involved fixing two sketchy null checks. Nothing huge.

NOTE: There's lots of non flow-strict code that makes checks on keys. Empty string is an invalid key. This is the behavior right now, so I left it unchanged.

I extracted it to another module because I'll be using it to check the existence of keys in other parts of the code too.

- Advertising new functionality
- Highlighting breaking API changes
- Rolling up subsequent updates affecting the same feature or dependency into the most recent change to reduce the noise

Summary:
When pasting rich (HTML) content into a Draft editor, the generated blocks
are flattened such that they can be represented in the internal state model.
Until a change to the tree-based model is fully implemented, that may cause
formatting to be lost if the content is wrapped in multiple levels of divs,
as the parsing does not traverse them deeply.

Improve the amount of formatting that can be preserved in the current model
by stripping out divs considered 'useless' (with no text or styling), such
that more important elements can be 'brought to the surface' and parsed
in a more pleasant manner.

Summary:
Attribute styles defined on a node were permanently added to the persistent set of styles.
This meant that any bold/italic/underline/strikethrough styles would persist until the end of the document, or until a different value was set for it.

This wasn't an issue in `convertFromHTMLToContentBlocks` because it would clone the current styles before passing them off to its children.
Since this was refactored away in `convertFromHTMLToContentBlocks2` (probably for perf reasons), I safely mutated `currentStyle` around its children, in the same way as `inlineStyle`.

Summary:
This PR is a new attempt to address https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/1895

On https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/2031 I was trying to make compositions work using the data provided by that event, and even though that works well for most operational system, that doesn't work well for Android, where you can make composition updates in multiple places on the same composition transaction.

This PR is an improvement over that PR, in that it uses a DOM mutation observer during the `compositionStart` -> `compositionEnd` interval to detect the changes the user made, and then re-apply those to the ContentState on `compositionEnd`.

This approach is the one used by [Prosemirror](http://prosemirror.net/) (see https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror-view/blob/master/src/domobserver.js), which is the only Rich Text Editor I've tried that works well on Android.
Like previously mentioned, it allows multiple mutations on multiple places in the same composition transaction, which was impossible with the previous approach, and would cause DOM<->state inconsistencies in multiple use cases.

The intent of this PR is not to fix every single Android bug, but to have a consistent editing experience on Android without introducing bugs (ideally).

**TODO, known issues:**
- [x] Removing empty line breaks with <backspace> doesn’t remove blocks.
- [x] Mutations on the same block (different leaf nodes) are not being properly applied.
- [x] Selection is not properly updated during composition events
- [ ] Keep `inlineStyleOverride` working with a consistent behavior

**TODO, others:**
- [x] Test on Android Pie v9 API 28
- [x] Test on Android Oreo v8.1 API 27
- [x] Test on Android Oreo v8.0 API 26
- [x] Test on iPhone 12.1 (with Japanese Kana keyboard)
- [x] Test composition events on Chrome Desktop v73
- [x] Test composition on IE11 (I didn't know how to test composition events though)
- [x] Unit tests

There are 3 ways to try out this PR.

Codesandbox: https://3ymzzlj9n5.codesandbox.io/ (uses `draft-js-android-fix-beta.3`)

Use the published [draft-js-android-fix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/draft-js-android-fix) package: `yarn install draft-js-android-fix`

Note that this package might not be up-to-date, it's hard for me to guarantee I'll always remember to update the package, but I'll do my best.

The other way is guaranteed to be up-to-date, but has a longer setup:
* run `git clone https://github.com/facebook/draft-js.git`
* run `git remote add fabiomcosta https://github.com/fabiomcosta/draft-js.git`
* run `git fetch fabiomcosta`
* run `git checkout -b attempt_android_fix_with_dom_diff fabiomcosta/attempt_android_fix_with_dom_diff`
* run `yarn install` (or use `npm`)
* run `open examples/draft-0-10-0/rich/rich.html`, or any other example you'd like to test

Summary:
The type of `joinClasses` in fbjs 1.0 which draft-js open-source uses is incorrect (it is correct in www), specify the correct type when importing.

I would have thought that I would have to cast the import to `any` before casting it to a different type, but apprently this works (tested in cloned github repo).

Summary:
Pasting text from Quip results in a space being inserted at the beginning of each new line (except for the first one), due to blocks including \n as a leading character that is then turned into a space.

I couldn't repro the issue with Word flagged in the comment (could be Word on Windows, or one of the older versions of Word?), but just in case I'm only removing the leading \n that is invisible in HTML and leaving the other replacements as is.

Summary:
**Summary**

If a content block was created with a key that contains the `-`, it would fail to decode the `decoratorKey` and the `leafKey` because the current implementation relies on `-` to be a parsing delimiter. Here's an example:

```js
class SomeComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    const block = new ContentBlock({
      type: 'paragraph',
      text: 'some-text',
      key: 'some-key'
    });

    const contentState = ContentBlock.createFromBlockArray([block]);

    this.state = {editorState: EditorState.createWithContent(contentState)};

    this.onChange = editorState => this.setState({editorState});
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Editor
        editorState={this.state.editorState}
        onChange={this.onChange}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

When you select anywhere on the editor, you'd get this error:

```
    TypeError: Cannot read property 'getIn' of undefined

      45 |   const focusBlockKey = focusPath.blockKey;
      46 |   const focusLeaf = editorState
    > 47 |     .getBlockTree(focusBlockKey)

Fixes #1756, and #1930. The tex and universal examples have their own dependencies, and relied on a different version of `react`/`react-dom` from the one defined for Draft.js. This caused a JS error when running the examples.

I have also added the missing lockfile for the universal example.

Summary:
**Summary**

Reverts https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/commit/7f0cab28386ec4bde8ec6289377bff9e53cd019b to bring back the `ariaOwneeID` prop. The ARIA property `aria-owns` is required for the combobox ARIA widget, in both ARIA 1.0 and 1.1. Some plugins, for example the Mentions and Emoji plugins, still pass an `ariaOwneeID` prop which at the moment doesn't do anything. Also, without `aria-owns`, some browser / screen reader combinations don't read out the suggestions at all. For more details please refer to the related issue #1736.

Fixes #1736.

Summary:
**Summary**

Currently pressing Option+Space in Chrome on OSX will cause a nonbreaking space to always be inserted into the editor. This behavior ignores any key bindings that the editor has set.

This change moves the logic which adds the non breaking space to after the point that the key binding function has been run in order to give editors a chance to handle this behavior on their own.

**Test Plan**

This has been tested manually since there are no current tests for the event handlers and no current framework for testing the handlers. We have been running [with this change in our fork of Draft](https://github.com/textioHQ/draft-js/commit/f4c3aebe6593e3ccdb1de4c15363e72faae0f236) for about seven months without issue.

Summary:
**Summary**

I have created a demo to illustrate this issue, feel free to look at [here](https://github.com/laysent/draft-js-drag-and-drop-issue)

If you look at `src/component/base/DraftEditor.react.js`, there is a problem with `_dragCount`:

When you drag a file into editor and drop it, `onDragEnter` will be triggered to increase `this._dragCount`. However, `onDragLeave` will not be triggered when dropping, thus `this._dragCount` will not be decreased back to 0.

Thus, after dragging and dropping, when user drags another file and NOT drop it, both `onDragEnter` and `onDragLeave` will be triggered. This time, `this._dragCount` will be increased then decreased. However, since it's initial value after dropping is not 0, it will not be decreased back to 0 after `dragLeave`, thus it will not trigger `this.exitCurrentMode()` in `onDragLeave`. Editor remains in ""drag"" mode.

To resolve this issue, simply set `_dragCount` back to 0 when dropping the file.

**Test Plan**

I don't think one is necessary for this issue. But would be happy to provide one if required.

Summary:
**Summary**

The note in the docs `Please note that the API for entity storage and management has changed recently; for details on updating your application see our v0.10 API Migration Guide` doesn't give a quick clear idea of what I should use instead of the old methods (I need to go to that migration guide, but let's suppose I'm a new user and I don't have any code to migrate). The problem becomes obvious after getting warnings in the browser console.  So my suggestion is to place deprecation notice right in the name header. I believe this would save some time for those who open docs just to see the method signatures.

Now (https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-entity.html):

Summary: We were wrongly converting from tree to raw whenever a block had a children array, even if no blocks actually have children. This is bad because when we toggle the GK, we clear the children, but we don't necessarily delete the field altogether (and shouldn't). A tree to raw conversion (or vice versa) is needed only when blocks are actually nested.

Updating to 1.13.6 which is the version used internally in Facebook's codebase, so that there are no conflicts in how prettier dictates formatting. Right now, we're seeing an issue where 1.13.6 dictates different formatting for nested ternary operators & this broke the Travis CI in https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/compare/0cb80b775ecd...fbc8a0cbfce6#diff-4e6b8232e09a07f699eebad1949b3ba3L118

Summary:
When the tree is updated, we need to make sure that we correctly mirror the parent-child & prevSibling-nextSibling links. The utility methods in this diff help make these pointer updates more resilient.

This diff introduces methods to add:
- a child to a parent (either as the first or last child)
- a prev <-> next sibling relationship

These functions will only respect the local invariants on the nodes being updated, and can leave the rest of the tree in an inconsistent state that requires a few more updates (see the test file for examples of this).

In the next diff, I'll be codifying some common paradigms (such as creating a new parent node & adding an existing node as  its child) which will use the methods implemented in this diff to simplify the logic. The paradigm-based operations will preserve the tree invariant after the operation.

Summary:
`DraftTreeAdapter` is called to convert list-data style Content Blocks into a valid Tree Data structure.

* The Tree Data structure has an invariant that only leaf nodes (i.e. nodes with no children) can have text in them. To respect this invariant, we need to create a new parent block at each level of a nested list. By implementing this, we fix a bug with the rendering of nested lists.
* Also adds the tree invariant check in DEV mode in `convertFromRawToDraftState` (which calls the tree adapter) to flag if this structure breaks again due to any updates.
* Re-record snapshot for `DraftTreeAdapter-test.js` and `convertFromRawToDraftState-test.js`

Summary:
We are disabling forward delete across blocks for now because it is rarely used
compared to backspace. We expect that people may not even notice, but if/when
they do then part of the roll-out for nested blocks will be to implement this
feature.

across nested blocks, see https://fb.quip.com/tybJAJoCmiRL

Summary:
1. Only leaf nodes have text.
2. Leaf nodes cannot have children.
3. Parent and child relationships should be mirrored.
4. Sibling relationship (``prevSibling`` & ``nextSibling``) should be mirrored.
5. All children of a parent must have sibling relationships.
6. The first node has no prev sibling.
7. The last node has no next sibling.
8. The data structure is a tree - fully connected & acyclic on the ``parent -> child`` and ``nextSibling`` edges.

We do these checks as:
* Go through each node in the block map and check that it is a valid node with respect to its properties and pointers to and from other nodes
* Find the first (unique) node of the tree and check that the tree is connected

Summary:
Fixes https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/1830 (bug introduced in https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/719; this is a proper fix for https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/398).

* When we're allowing native insertion, we don't want to modify the selection because doing so blocks browser features like spellcheck from working
* In all other cases when typing, we *do* want to force the selection – failing to do this is why the original issue occurred
* We use the `insert-characters` change type for both native and non-native insertions
* Instead of guessing in `EditorState.push` whether to force a selection, accept it as a parameter
* Gate all changes by `draft_non_native_insertion_forces_selection`

I verified with the feature flag disabled (same behavior as before):

* Typing over a character works, and the cursor moves as expected (because of the `chars === currentlySelectedChars` check)
* With editor contents ""ABC\ndef"", replacing ""d"", ""e"", or ""f"" with the character above *fails* to replace the char (because that check is buggy).

And with the feature flag enabled (new behavior):

* Typing over a character still works (but does so without the buggy check)
* With editor contents ""ABC\ndef"", replacing ""d"", ""e"", or ""f"" with the character above *succeeds* at replacing the char.

Summary:
In some cases, we need to prevent native insertion because native insertion would leave the decorators in the wrong place (and critically – editOnInput's attempt to patch things up would just make things worse and process the insertion twice). This new logic should be correct.

Previously, typing '#' before 'f' in 'x #foo' would result in 'x ###foo' (extra '#' inserted).

Summary:
Most of the time when people annotate something with `React.Element<any>` or `React.Element<*>` they don't really care about it really being a React element, and would be just as happy with `React.Node`. The exceptions I encountered when writing this diff were:

1) places where people do `React.cloneElement` -- in that case we of course need an element
2) components that want some of the props or children to be a certain component type -- but in those cases we ought to specify the type of element rather than accepting `any` or `*`

As such, it's reasonable to replace `React.Element<any>` and `React.Element<*>` if doing so does not cause any Flow errors, and this should put a noticeable dent in our usage of unsafe Flow types.

Summary:
While working on T27852583, I came across some files missing flow and format, and had some difficultly because of T28161651 (we don't have docs about what props are passed to decorator components) and we don't have Flow typing.

In most situations, `DraftEditorBlock` supplies the props to the decorator components: https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/master/src/component/contents/DraftEditorBlock.react.js#L201-L213

Note: It is possible for a Custom Block Component to be provided: https://draftjs.org/docs/advanced-topics-block-components.html#content

If we have a common Flow type declaring what props are expected, then we can ensure consistency if/when these props change.

Summary:
**Summary**

This should fix #1621 (it does in our project).

This manually transforms the BlockNode interface to use properties like the build step will do, but it adds covariant property annotations to match the expectation that classes have read-only methods. A better solution would be to fix the transform itself to do the right thing with interface methods, but this should be equivalent and is easier (for me) to do.

**Test Plan**

Confirm that the output lib/BlockNode.js.flow includes the covariant property annotations (`+`) before each of the properties that were previously methods. The automated test infrastructure only runs over src so it's harder to verify in travis as-is.

Summary:
We found via logging that this flag actually is being used in some cases - so we need to keep setting it.
Seems like the closest we can get to the current timing is to set it in a child
component which mounts when a successful 'render' of the parent DraftEditor
finishes. This is an amazing hack that sophiebits thought of to deal with the
other flag we were setting in cWU.

Summary:
By naming bundle size stats with the bundle name instead of the package version:
  - `yarn build` will produce stats for both the development bundle
    (Draft.js.json) and the production bundle (Draft.min.js.json) which we can
    track separately. The minified bundle is good for understanding what file
    size we will be advertising (albeit pre-gzip/brotli) while the development version
    is useful for seeing a 1:1 mapping between changes in code and bundle size.
  - The size stats will get overwritten everytime somebody builds and checks in,
    but that is desirable. Instead of keeping the entire history of the bundle
    size always checked-in (and possibly not in sync with the actual versions),
    git will keep track of the bundle size over time. Whenever we release, the
    size of the stats file for that release is whatever is in Draft.min.js.json
    at the time of release.

Here are the separate bundles (as visualized by
https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/):

Development: https://files.terriblefish.com/chrome_2018-02-16_12-11-22.png

Summary:
**Summary**

This dependency got introduced in a separate commit (f8ca29d1a7fa5a8bb89cb9be9a66d12732a0bfa7) from the others in #1644. I imagine this is a mistake since it only provides dev-time tooling.

**Test Plan**

For development, we can try a fresh install of the project:

1. `rm -rf node_modules`
2. `yarn install`. This runs `npm run build` via the `prepublish` script, so if it works it's good to go.

I don't think dependencies and devDependencies are processed any differently in a development environment, so not sure this check is even necessary.

For the published package:

1. `mkdir test`
2. `npm init -y`
3. `npm install git+https://github.com/thibaudcolas/draft-js.git#patch-2`
4. `npm ls --depth=1`

The `npm ls` result should be:

```
├─┬ draft-js@0.10.5 (git+https://github.com/thibaudcolas/draft-js.git#cb06920d0f3dea77692680dddba6ec475663c7b2)

└── UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY react-dom@^0.14.0 || ^15.0.0-rc || ^16.0.0-rc || ^16.0.0
```

Note `uglifyjs-webpack-plugin` is absent, whereas it would have been there with `npm install git+https://github.com/thibaudcolas/draft-js.git#master`.

Summary:
**Summary**

Fixes #1650.

Travis is using Node 8 since 247a632ab6420e7809a8f7cf7dd2b31b495bb4c7, and Prettier is already configured in a way that's not Node-6 compatible:

https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a6317e60b06519d3c00a2c0621701f3da0837a88/prettier.config.js#L3

Node 8 is the LTS release line since late october 2017 so I think it's fair to remove support for Node 6.

NB: I see `devEngines` also states support for npm 2 and 3. Node 8 ships with npm 5 by default, so I imagine those 2 versions could be removed as well. Edit: Ah actually I see draft-js is at least partially using yarn since #1568 / #1570.

**Test plan**

No tests. This is only removing support, it doesn't affect supported versions.

Summary:
**tldr;** Handlers can get called after cWU and before cDU, and they use the
cached 'latestEditorState'. For them to get the fresh version of the state,
we need to update 'latestEditorState' in 'render' because that happens before
the handlers get called.

**The whole story;**
We are trying to remove cWU from `DraftEditor.react.js`. One thing which
currently happens there is that `latestEditorState` gets set to the
nextProps.editorState, so whatever is passed in by the parent. For more context
on the initial attempt at changing this, see
https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/diff/D6873303/

This change introduced one bug that manifested in various ways - see T26034821
and T26020049. I'll focus on T26020049, which broke
`<AdsBulkTokenizedTextInputWithFieldsSelector>`.

`<AdsBulkTok...FieldsSelection>` has a button for adding a new token, and when
you hit that button it passes `<DraftEditor>` an updated editorState as a prop.
This triggers render #1, and during that render we update the browser
selection, which triggers `focus` and `blur` events. These each trigger another
render of `<DraftEditor>`; renders #2 and #3. Here is how it looks on a
timeline:
```
render #1
+
|
| cWU -> latestEditorState = FRESH_STATE
|
| render -> this.props.editorState = FRESH_STATE
| +
| |
| +--> triggers 'focus' event, calling 'handleFocus' with latestEditorState
|                   +
|                   |
+>cDU fires         | the 'handleFocus' call schedules render #2
                    | with latestEditorState, which is FRESH_STATE
                    |
render #2  <--------+
+
|
| cWU -> latestEditorState = FRESH_STATE
|
| render -> this.props.editorState = FRESH_STATE
|
+>cDU fires
```
When we move the update of latestEditorState to cDM, things go awry like this;
```
render #1
+
|
| cWU -> Nothing ... latestEditorState = STALE_STATE :(
|
| render -> this.props.editorState = FRESH_STATE
| +
| |
| +--> triggers 'focus' event, calling 'handleFocus' with latestEditorState
|                                                +
|                                                |
+>cDU -> latestEditorState = FRESH_STATE         | the 'handleFocus' call schedules render #2
                                                 | with latestEditorState, which is STALE_STATE :(
                                                 |
render #2 <--------------------------------------+
+
|
| cWU -> nothing updates
|
| render -> this.props.editorState = STALE_STATE :(  because this was passed in above
|
+>cDU fires and resets latestEditorState = STALE_STATE :(
```

So we can fix things by updating latestEditorState inside the `render` method,
like so;
```
render #1
+
|
| cWU -> Nothing ... latestEditorState = STALE_STATE :(
|
| render -> this.props.editorState = FRESH_STATE
| +         *and* set latestEditorState = FRESH_STATE
  |
| |
| +--> triggers 'focus' event, calling 'handleFocus' with latestEditorState
|                                                +
|                                                |
+>cDU -> latestEditorState = FRESH_STATE         | the 'handleFocus' call schedules render #2
                                                 | with latestEditorState, which is FRESH_STATE
                                                 |
render #2 <--------------------------------------+
+
|
| cWU -> nothing updates
|
| render -> this.props.editorState = FRESH_STATE which was passed in above
|
+>cDU fires and resets latestEditorState = FRESH_STATE
```

One possible issue would be if `render` fired and then was never completed, in
async. mode, but since Draft is intended to always be run in sync. mode I'm not
worried about that.

blocks selection events from being handled while React is rendering - the thing
is, this has never been a problem that we can see.

We are logging to see if real users actually hit this bug and if the flag
prevents a bad state in that case.

If we find that the flag is never hit, then it will soon be removed, unlocking
removal of a deprecated lifecycle method.

Misc changes that:
1. Make the dev environment work on Windows and Node v9.
1. Upgrade Webpack and UglifyJS.
1. Build now outputs build stats to the `meta/bundle-size-stats directory/` dir.
    1. The build stats are named the current package version, e.g. the current one is `version-0.10.5.json`.
    1. An example of this file can be seen here: https://files.terriblefish.com/version-0.10.5.json
    1. This json file can be visualized in any of the various tools online, e.g. [the official tool](https://webpack.github.io/analyse) which is great for visualizing module dependencies and [this one from Chris Bateman](http://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/) that makes visualizing file sizes really nice.

**Test Plan**

`npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run flow` all pass

**Misc**
* I don't think any of these changes need tests
* No API changes

Summary:
The last thing we do inside 'componentWillUpdate' in DraftEditor is update the
'_latestEditorState'.

This was introduced in https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/666 and that
PR has a great explanation in the comments.

**BUT** when manually testing this, the bug with dead key deletion and korean
IME deletion not working was still happening, even with the current state of
things. So that was interesting. It doesn't seem to fix the thing we originally
intended, unless I'm missing something.

In a later change (https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/diff/D4778712/)
passes latestEditorState to handlers, so that they can use the latest editor
state instead of stale editor state. This fixed many bugs in our own uses of
Draft.js.

And since there are many untested IME cases, it could be that some situations
are still improved by storing and tracking the '_latestEditorState'.

We already set '_latestEditorState' inside 'update' and that is always called
before 'componentWillUpdate'. My first approach is to just rely on that and
remove the updating in 'componentWillUpdate'.

Updating '_latestEditorState' in 'componentWillUpdate' does potentially give
us important info though; if the 'onChange' handler mutated the editorState
then we will need to use that, and we get it in 'componentWillUpdate'.

If we want to maintain this, then I propose the following;
- Move '_latestEditorState' into state in 'DraftEditor' and create a public
  getter method to access it.
- Update it in the new static method 'getDerivedStateFromProps' and then use
  the polyfill wrapper to make Draft.js backwards compatible.
I'd rather skip that if it turns out we don't rely on '_latestEditorState'
being updated after 'onChange' is called. With so many uses and so few tests,
the only way to know is to try it. :)

Follow-up action items:
- Add a unit test for latestEditorState being used and passed to handlers.
- Open the GK to 70% employees and let that sit for a couple of days, to verify
  that this doesn't cause major problems. Continue roll-out and remove GK.
- Add inline comments explaining why we track and use '_latestEditorState'.

Summary:
In the past Draft.js set a 'blockSelectEvents' flag on 'componentWillUpdate'
and unset it in 'componentDidUpdate'.

The reason for this, according to comments in the code, was that IE will fire
a 'selectionChange' event when we programmatically change the selection,
meaning it would trigger a new select event while we are in the middle of
updating.

**Edit:**
We found that the 'selection.addRange' was what triggered the stray `selectionchange` event in IE, for the record.[1] Thanks sophiebits for the tip about that.

When manually testing, I saw no bugs or inconsistencies introduced when the extra 'selectionchange' event fired in IE. The event would go into React, and yet it was never logged as triggering a handler in Draft.js.

So either that `selectionchange` event was not one that Draft.js. listened to, or React ignores/defers it because it's in the middle of a commit.

This diff does two things:
- Add logging to verify if we ever actually use the `blockSelectEvents` flag in practice. Is it actually blocking anything??? And if not, as I suspect, then;
- We can just remove it. This also removes it under a GK, so we can test on 50% employees first and see if they experience any bugs.

Lastly - I do want to add tests for this. It is error-prone and time consuming to set up and repeately do manual testing. Going to put together an outline of what I think the test should look like in a follow-up diff.

…because we didn't give TAB, ESCAPE, LEFT, UP, RIGHT, or DOWN a chance to produce a command name.

This pull request:

1. deprecates the prop-based key handlers (`onUpArrow` et al.) and encourages people to move their custom key logic into a `keyBindingFn`, and
2. lets the named keypresses fall through to the `keyBindingFn` whenever a prop-based key handler isn't supplied.
3. Updates the homepage and the rich text example.

Summary:
In D6727557, we tried wrapping all Draft event handlers in `ReactDOM.flushSync`. The purpose was to ensure that updates scheduled inside event handlers would flush before React yields back to the browser. (This is only relevant to async mode, since in sync mode everything is sync by default.)

The problem was that `flushSync` contains an invariant that throws if it is called inside a lifecycle method, to protect against reentrant React renders, which we intentionally do not support. What's nice about this invariant is that it guarantees all the work is flushed by the time the function returns. Usually this is fine, because event handlers are at the top of the stack. But there are cases where an event is dispatched from inside a lifecycle, like `el.focus`.

The fix is to switch to a new lifecycle method, `unstable_flushControlled`. This is similar to `flushSync`, but it will not throw if called inside a lifecycle; instead, the work will be deferred and flushed at the end of the current batch. This still satisfies Draft's requirement that the work is flushed before React yields to the browser.

`flushSync` is still the preferred API for most cases, but what we've learned from this is that it's only safe if you can be sure it's not nested inside other React work. E.g. calling it from inside a `requestAnimationFrame` callback is perfectly safe because you know you're at the top of the stack. If there's any indirection, especially related to DOM events, you likely want `flushControlled` instead.

Summary:
This PR is part of a series of PR's that will be exploring **tree data block support** in Draft.

**Adding support for tree data structures**

This PR includes the missing parts for adding support for internal tree data structure by providing:

* last transaction insertFragmentIntoContentState.js
* last modifier AtomicBlockUtils
* fixing a bug on the randomizeBlockMapKeys to handle orphanated fragments

This is the last PR of the series to add support for internal tree data structures, from here we should then either update `RichTextEditorUtil` to have some `tree` awareness and having some controls for creating nesting content or create a new `NestedRichTextEditorUtil` that can be used for that. Ideally that work would also come with a `demo` example page

Summary:
**what is the change?:**
We have verified that upgrading to Prettier v1.9.0 or v1.9.1 both cause
a Segmentation Fault when running `eslint`. This happens in CI, and I
was able to verify it locally.

**why make this change?:**
We want to use Prettier in CI and not get segmentation faults.

**test plan:**
Locally I did -
`rm -rf node_modules && yarn install && yarn lint` and got no segfault.
Pushing this to github and waiting for CI to pass will further verify.

Summary:
Fixes facebook/draft-js#1514

**Summary**

According to the [Flow documentation](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/components/#toc-using-default-props), when using default props, the prop should be marked as required, as ""Flow will make sure that [the prop] is optional if you have a default prop for [it].""

This fixes Flow errors that would occur when using Draft.js in a project with Flow. Flow would complain that `blockRendererFn` and `blockStyleFn` could potentially be `undefined` when passed to `DraftEditorContents`, even though these two properties have default values, so they will never be undefined.

This commit also upgrades Flow to 0.59.0, since there weren't any additional Flow errors between the version of Flow that was being used (0.53.1) and the latest version of Flow (0.59.0).

**Test Plan**

 * Flow check passes
 * A sample project, such as https://github.com/bjohn465/draft-and-flow-errors, does not produce Flow errors when using Draft.js

Summary:
**what is the change?:**
Adding a document linking to the Facebook Open Source Code of Conduct,
for visibility and to meet Github community standards.

**why make this change?:**
Facebook Open Source provides a Code of Conduct statement for all
projects to follow.

Draft.js already links to this Code of Conduct in the Contributing
guide, which is great!

Exposing the COC via a separate markdown file is a standard being
promoted by Github via the Community Profile in order to meet their Open
Source Guide's recommended community standards.

As you can see, adding this file will complete [Draft's Community Profile](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/community)
checklist and increase the visibility of our COC.

Summary:
This is a quick fix, but we will do a follow-up diff to add more precautions
and fix any other misnamed refs. Want to push this asap to fix the bug.

In a previous diff[1] we changed the syntax for getting the reference to the
editor node, but this spot was not updated.
[1]: https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/diff/D5964582/

This introduced a bug where clicking a link caused the focus to move but the
selection state was not cleared, and this is a known issue in Safari in
particular. In the past we had a work-around in Draft, but the work-around was
no longer working due to the misnamed ref.

PS Thanks to @[578934877:sophiebits] for pairing with me and realizing the root cause of the bug. :)

- removed nested describes in favor of plain 'test' to increase readability

Summary:
This PR enables prettier on draft.js codebase and adds a few more standard eslint rules.

- setting up prettier dependencies
- setting up format command from the `package.json` to enable `yarn run format` or `npm run format`
- setting up eslint configuration file with new rules and with prettier compatibility
- adding old examples to the formatting eslint exclusions (If we care about fixing the new linting rules for them we can do it in a new PR)

Summary:
**what is the change?:**
CREDIT TO darobin for this change, originally made in
https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/566

 ---

Some CSS pre-processors understand node_modules and are able to import without requiring an absolute path. However, without assistance from the module all that they can resolve is its root directory. This leads to import statements like the following:

```
import ""draft-js/dist/Draft.css"";
```

While this works, it requires internal knowledge of the package's layout. This requires digging around and if the layout changes, this breaks.

These pre-processors also recognise a style field in package.json, which is the equivalent of main for CSS. This allows one to import thusly:

```
import ""draft-js"";
```

It's a small change, but it helps!

Summary:
**Summary**

The function 'lookUpwardForInlineStyle' repeatedly called 'getPreviousBlock' which has the complexity O(n). This tanks performance when creating a document with lots of empty lines. Simply holding down the enter key will quickly cause the frame rate to drop below 1fps.

The fix is straightforward and, in my opinion, preferable to a while loop.

**Test Plan**

I did some manual testing. The code was able to correctly (and efficiently) find the correct style.

Summary:
Draft is unhappy when text manages to get added outside of the DraftEditorTextNode span. I'd like to highlight that text in red to make it more noticeable so that people might notice what editing patterns trigger it.

I would have liked to do this universally for all Draft inputs (if a certain flag is turned on), but CSS doesn't make this possible: there's no way to style just the text content in a node without styling children, and there's no way to inherit a property from the grandparent element ignoring the parent's styles.

So instead you have to do this manually per editor callsite so that you actually know the correct text color. Those rules will look like:

```
.public/myEditor/root .public/DraftEditor/highlightInvalidText .public/DraftEditor/leaf {
  /* Draft.js errors are shown in red text when in a GK */
  background: red;
  color: white;
}

.public/myEditor/root .public/DraftEditor/leaf .public/DraftEditor/textNode {
  background: white;
  color: black;  /* <-- actual text color */
}
```

Summary:
**Summary**
- calling `Style.getScrollParent(editorNode)` with `null` will result in an uncaught error
- `Ref#focus()` is often called within a `setTimeout` (even in some example IIRC). `Ref` doesn't get GCd, but the DOM node it points to may no longer exist. Since React v16 is so blazing fast, it's possible that we're trying to focus something that no longer exists.
- Without this bit of code, we'd have to call `findDOMNode` on the ref before calling `focus`. That's not great since putting `findDOMNode` is discouraged in application code.

Summary:
**Summary**
This new documentation page is under ""Advanced Topics"" and between ""Text Direction"" and ""Issues and Pitfalls"".
It documents the ways to have race conditions based on consecutive EditorState updates and best practices to avoid this issue.
This was motivated by issue #318.

It also updates the CSS to make all images' width to 650px which is the width of the right column content, hope that's fine. (this version of markdown (Marked) doesn't allow to set the image width).

**Test Plan**
Go to /docs/advanced-topics-editorstate-race-conditions.html and check the page loads.

Summary:
**what is the change?:**
We don't allow pasting whitespace-only blocks - see https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/231

In the past we set the 'src' as the text content of an 'img' block when
pasting/converting HTML, but sometimes the 'src' is really long and can
even crash the editor. Plus that's not really what users expect when
they paste an image.

An empty string as a default would be better but the code in
`convertFromHTML` needs refactored and for now I don't want to touch it.
The camera emoji is a cute and easy fix.

**why make this change?:**
Right now images are being dropped by `convertFromHTML

**test plan:**
Manual testing with examples/draft-0-10-0/convertFromHTML/convert.html

We should do a follow-up change to add a test that catches this.

Note the `data-labels=""active element""` and the `| selection anchor node, selection focus node` in the anonymized DOM, and all the extra properties in extraParams.

This should help us debug getting `NS_ERROR_FAILURE` in Firefox when calling selection.extend().

Summary:
WARNING: This diff introduces a **BREAKING change** from current Draft: when you paste an image it will no longer render the url of the image (it renders nothing).

= Main Issue =
This diff addresses the issue raised on https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/1101

tl;dr of this issue is that by setting the url src as the textContent it creates a significant delay in parsing data: urls since they can easily be ~60KB. This happens because the content of the img will be parsed by draft and for each character there will be an entity reference and entity style entry.

= Solutions =
In the comments of the issue 2 solutions were proposed:
1) Ignore data: urls from being parsed from HTML.
2) Stop setting the textContent of the img node when parsing HTML.

In this diff I'm going with solution **2)** becase as flarnie points out in her comment, support to parse img tags was added with the decorator usecase in mind (and ignoring data: urls would make a decorator not render in this case), also, as an example, quip doesn't render anything when an image is pasted so we think this behaviour is reasonable.

The main downside of this approach is the introduction of a breaking change in the framework, but I think it's acceptable and I'm not expecting any big issue because of this (please correct me if I'm wrong).

= Implementation =
Ideally I wouldn't set anything on textContent but I'm forced too because otherwise Draft won't create an entity for it. Entity creation is only done if the current node being parsed has children, otherwise skipped: diffusion/E/browse/tfb/trunk/www/html/shared/draft-js/model/encoding/convertFromHTMLToContentBlocks.js;3261725$483.
My current solution is to set it to a single space, looks a bit clowny though.

Is the children restriction something we might want to change? The only use case I can see though is when we want to create entities just for decorators to act upon (which is this case).

= A Tale of Two URI implementations =
While fixing and testing I noticed that on our internal version of Draft it crashes when you try to paste a data url.
I looked into it and found that internally we have a version of URI that has plenty of checks: diffusion/E/browse/tfb/trunk/www/html/shared/core/URIBase.js;3262904$242 and it fails because `data:` is not an allowed protocol: diffusion/E/browse/tfb/trunk/www/html/shared/core/URISchemes.js;3263158$11. While on our public version we have a shim based implementation: https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/master/packages/fbjs/src/__forks__/URI.js.

I'm not expecting pasting data urls to be a common behaviour so not a big deal but we do use URI to check other src attributes in HTML. I recommend to add 'data' to the list of supported protocols. Any reason not to?

Is there any chance we could open source our version of URI? It's tricky testing Draft if we have two different implementations for this.

= Breaking Change =
Any advice on how to deal with this?
The CRMComposer tests explicitly tested the URL rendering, adding tylercraft to the diff to make sure this is fine.

Summary:
When typing the first character of a block, Draft always tries to call .preventDefault() on the beforeinput(/keypress) even for that character's insertion, because browsers are likely to mess up the DOM into a form we don't expect.

We check this by reading from the editorState and checking whether the selection is at the start of a block (either at the beginning of a line that is present, or if there is no text in a line yet).

In the case of React Fiber's async rendering, it was possible to get into a state where when inserting two characters AB, A's insertion would be correctly prevented and queued to occur via React rendering, but B's insertion would not get prevented, so it would happen natively even though in many cases A's rendering had not occurred yet.

We already had two copies of editorState we could consider to determine which path to take:

* ._latestEditorState is the last state we have enqueued a rerender for. We always read from this in most of our event handlers so that if you type multiple characters, they are queued in order and don't clobber each other, regardless of whether there has been a rerender in the meantime.
* .props.editorState is the last state that we've run cWRP/sCU/cWU/render on. In sync React, this always matches what we have actually rendered to the DOM (by the time we make it to an event handler). In async React, it doesn't, since we don't always run render in the same tick that we commit.

Checking isSelectionAtLeafStart on .props.editorState is more correct since it more closely resembles the current state of the DOM (and this logic should depend on the actual state of the DOM, not the model state), but it is still incorrect in some cases. I added:

* ._latestCommittedEditorState is the last state that we've committed to the DOM and run cDU on. In sync React, this matches .props.editorState. In async React, it is meaningfully different and does not get updated until the commit, while .props.editorState could get updated during a render that gets paused or aborted.

Changing the logic to call isSelectionAtLeafStart on ._latestCommittedEditorState makes it so we correctly determine when to prevent native character insertion. (I think.)

Test Plan:

Open plain text editor with React's useSyncScheduling set to false.
With the editor empty, press two characters on your keyboard simultaneously.
Previously, this would cause an error dialog (.removeChild of the <br> node within DraftEditorLeaf throws since it's already deleted); now it seems to reliably inserts both characters. I did this 40 or so times in a row without it crashing.
(If changed to .props.editorState but not ._latestCommittedEditorState, it fails about once every dozen or two times on my machine. Could easily be different on another machine due to scheduling randomness.)

I still occasionally saw an issue where you end up with both a <span data-text=""true""> and a <br data-text=""true""> rendered. I believe this is due to other bugs in async React, not any failing of Draft."

**what is the change?:**
Moved 'DraftFeatureFlags' to 'stubs' directory, and make it export

of sync with our internal FB version of Draft. That is because we
actually use different flag configs within FB than the defaults for OS.

There is some really weird behavior in Android 5.0 when auto-correct happens.
More details here;

Setting 'spellCheck' to 'false' didn't seem to be enough to stop this.

My quick fix for now is to expose more properties on Draft for
controlling autocorrect. This could also be useful to people in general,
since there are often complaints about autocorrect on mobile web.

Long term we will be addressing the root causes of the bugs with mobile
web, but this seems like a useful change regardless.

We did some testing with mobile web using these props.

This is part of an effort to make releases simpler and more frequent,
and keep the internal and external versions of Draft in sync.

As part of matching up the internal and external Draft flags we added
the changes from PR #1065 by @mmmoussa, with the main change under a
flag that is set to false.

---Test Plan
Manually tested the examples in Chrome, and we will do the full test
plan before releasing v0.10.1."

Related to issue #1011

There is a bug in Android 5.1 (not 5.0 oddly enough) that makes text
entry nearly unusable. It's documented in detail here -
https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/1011

Logging everything shows that;
 - when we have a block with text and spaces, and start deleting the
   characters one by one, there is an 'onInput' for each deletion that
   updates the text.
 - when you delete the very last character, the 'anchorNode' of the
   domSelection has a type that is not a text node. So we skip updating
   at all, and that means the last character doesn't actually get
   properly deleted from editorState.
 - Then the next time something fully updates the editorState, that last
   character shows up again.

The root issue is that Android 5.1, when we tested it, was in
""composition"" mode and the current handlers are not really built to
handle text deletion properly in composition mode.

We're looking forward to finding a more complete solution to the root
cause - for now this change improves the usability on mobile and doesn't
break anything."

There was a race condition in the website generation script. It calls convert.js to convert Markdown to JavaScript, and then immediately looks for the resulting js files. However, convert.js uses the async version of `glob()`. This means that the code in generate.js that looks for these files can execute **before** the conversion in convert.js finishes, resulting in no pages being built. When this happens on TravisCI, it deletes all the pages on the site, due to the `rm -Rf *` in `publish.sh`. I've simply switched convert.js to use the synchronous version of `glob()` so that it's guaranteed to finish before the generation happens."

- Allows roadmap to be living, breathing document with updates as time goes by
- Allows collaboration/discussion from community

Private methods should not be called as public methods. A recent PR
(https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/814) added warnings to the
public-but-deprecated API of DraftEntity, and then moved the logic for
those methods into private methods that can be called within the
Draft.js framework.

These methods are ""private"" in the sense that we are only calling them
within Draft. They should not be used outside of the Draft library,
because they will be removed in an upcoming version of the library.

We have a transform step that causes issues when an underscore-prefixed
method is called outside of it's module, so changing the method names
seems like the easiest way to deal with this issue and still send the
message that they are private.

There is a way to turn off the transformation step on a file-by-file
basis but that would lead to touching more files than this approach, and
this code will be deprecated in the next release anyway."

* Fix trailing comma lints

I'm not sure why ESLint didn't catch these at some point on Github - but
in any case we are fixing it now.

I ran the `trailing-commas.js` js-codemod and it only touched one file
for some reason. Probably I missed something about the jscodeshift API.
In any case, I fixed the other lints that our internal linter was
catching.

* Use DraftEntity type instead of EntityMap type in helpers

While supporting both the old and new APIs in Draft.js for Entity
manipulation, we are calling to the old DraftEntity module under the
hood instead of using the new system that would use an Immutable.js
OrderedMap called the EntityMap.

The DraftEntity module now has private methods for entity manipulation
that don't warn, and the public API which we are deprecating has
warnings and then calls the private methods.

In short, there are places where the flow typing wasn't right because
it was expecting EntityMap, and not DraftEntity.

I don't know why flow didn't catch this when we merged
https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/814

test plan: `flow src`

* Fix flow error caused by passing command to RichUtils.handleKeyCommand

The 'handleKeyCommand' takes either a 'DraftEditorCommand' type or any
string.  This allows users to have their own custom editor command
types. I'm not sure how common this is, but our current flow typing
allows it.

The flow typing of 'RichUtils.handleKeyCommand' is more strict - it only
allows 'DraftEditorCommand' types, and not custom strings. This causes
an issue in one of our use cases, where we pass the 'command' received
in 'handleKeyCommand' through to 'RichUtils.handleKeyCommand'.

It seems like the 'RichUtils.handleKeyCommand' should have an API
similar to 'DraftEditor.handleKeyCommand', and so we're loosening the
flow type on 'RichTuils.handleKeyCommand'.

Test Plan: `flow`

* Fix flow error with DraftEditor.setClipboard

This was causing flow errors in our internal code because we expect that
'null' or 'undefined' is ok as an argument to 'setClipboard'.

Test Plan: `flow src`

* Fix flow and lint errors in CharacterMetadata

Again - I'm not sure why the github CI didn't catch these issues
earlier. I wonder if the issue with the typing of Immutable.OrderedMap
relates to the version of Immutable.js we are using or something."

Fixes #92.

If an onChange handler replaces every ""x"" with an ""abc"", then when you type ""x"", we trigger onChange from beforeinput and rerender immediately with the content ""abc"", then the browser still inserts an ""x"" character!

This fix is surprisingly simple: instead of triggering an update during beforeinput, we simply wait until the input event to do so. This means that when we rerender, the browser would have already inserted the ""x"" character and React will correctly delete it when rerendering.

Test Plan: In plaintext example, change the handler to

```
this.onChange = (editorState) => {
  var content = editorState.getCurrentContent();
  return this.setState({
    editorState: EditorState.set(editorState, {
      currentContent: Modifier.removeInlineStyle(content, content.getSelectionAfter(), 'OVERFLOW');
    }),
  });
};
```

then type. Characters don't get duplicated like they did before."

* Add warnings and comments about deprecating old Entity API

We are deprecating the old DraftEntity API.

Why? Because
 - currently changing or adding entities won't trigger a re-render
 - the use of a non-Immutable storage for entities doesn't fit well with
   the rest of the Draft architecture
 - moves Entity storage out of global module; this just makes more sense
   as an API, rather than having it globally available.

This moves the logic for the old API into private methods, and adds
warnings and comments around the public-but-deprecated API methods.

We then use the private methods internally while we still support both
APIs.

A future version of Draft will actually remove the old API completely,
and these warnings and comments will help folks make updates to their
code to prepare.

We will release more documentation about this soon.

* Update syntax of tex example

This example was still using the old syntax, and the new warnings we
added alerted us to this fact when doing manual testing."

(Landed at Facebook as D4056089 over a month ago, copying back out.)

Summary:
If we have a state update enqueued but the rerender hasn't happened, and a select event comes in, we can't do anything useful with it because although we could compare the last rendered editor state with the DOM selection, we can't make a rational choice for how to update the latest queued editor state with the DOM selection. (Previously, this code was throwing away any content change which would lead to a loss of inserted chars in many Windows IME scenarios.)

In particular, if you type in Korean w/ Windows IME then press space,

* compositionend arrives, causing us to set a 20ms timeout for resolving the composition,
* at that time, the text is already inserted in the DOM
* then keydown 32 comes in, which (due to my recent changes) makes the composition resolve immediately
* we enqueue a rerender with the composed text
* our 'select' polyfill also turns the keydown into a select event, and that select event has the *new* cursor position corresponding to the text that is already inserted to the DOM

Basically, the DOM has 안녕하세요, the last editorstate is """" with selection [0, 0], the queued editorstate is ""안녕하세요"" with selection [5, 5], and you get a selection event [5, 5].

Since there's nothing useful we can do with this, we now ignore the selection event. The risk here is that we now are ignoring important selection events and the editor state selection lags behind the DOM selection. isaac and I don't know of any scenarios in which this would matter -- if we do find some, we might be able to instead change this code to re-check the selection after a rerender to make sure that we have the latest selection.

Test Plan:
Type dkssudgktpdy then Space with Korean keyboard on Windows Chrome, Windows Firefox, Windows IE, Windows Edge, Mac Chrome, Mac Firefox. It either does the right thing (inserting ""안녕하세요 "") or it does the same thing as cstools which doesn't have any of my changes from this week.

Type normally, move the cursor, select all, copy, backspace, repeated backspace in the same browsers."

A previous PR had completely removed 'DraftEntity' the module and moved
control over entities into ContentState.[1] This changed several public
APIs of Draft.js in a non-backwards compabible way.

[1]: https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/376

To make it easier to migrate multiple use cases to the new Draft.js API,
and because the transition is too complex for a simple codemod, we are
releasing a version that supports both the new and the old API and then
later releasing a version that breaks the old API completely.

In order to renew support for the old API while also supporting the new
API, this PR
 - restores the DraftEntity module and associated tests/mocks
 - calls into DraftEntity methods under the hood of the new API

We tried to leave as much of the new API code in place and unchanged as
possible, so that things will be easier when we are fully removing
DraftEntity and switching to the new approach.

Next steps:
 - A PR to add warnings and comments about the deprecation of the old
   API
 - Add this, the warnings, and other recent PRs to 0.10.0 alpha version
 - Add documentation about migrating from deprecated to new API
 - Release 0.10.0; support both APIs
 - Make PR that basically undoes this one, moving entity control into
   ContentState, and release that as version 0.11.0, with warning that
   it no longer supports the deprecated API."

Flow wasn't finding the 'ReactDOM' node module. In the past it was (I
assume) finding this dependency inside of the React package - but in
React 15.4.0 the ""secret"" copy of ReactDOM was split out completely
into it's own module.[1]

It seems like we should be able to use `scripts/module_map.js` to
specify the mapping of `ReactDOM` to `react-dom` but updating that was
not making a difference to Flow, so I added a mapping option to the flow
config.

* Remove unused render guard logic

* Fix dead key deletion

If you type Option-E, Backspace, then the in-progress accented character should be deleted. Similarly, in 2-Set Korean, if you press A, Backspace, the character should be deleted. Both of these don't work correctly yet, but this commit fixes it.

Currently, when you press Backspace, we are in composition mode and we receive a compositionend event then a keydown event for the backspace. Our composition handler doesn't exist composition mode immediately but rather waits 20ms to see if it gets a compositionstart event immediately (and if so, does not exit). It seems like if we receive a compositionend event then a keydown, we always want to exit composition mode immediately and re-interpret the keydown in edit mode. Here I do so.

This change is made trickier by the fact that each event handler reads from `this.props.editorState`, which doesn't get updated until the next rerender (that is, not synchronously). To combat this, we store the most current editor state in an instance variable and refer to it from all of the event handlers. (If we don't do this then the backspace isn't interpreted correctly by editOnKeyDown because the character data from compositionend hasn't been inserted into the editor state, so we'd end up effectively dropping the entire composition as well as deleting the preceding character.) In this commit, only editOnKeyDown needs the latest state but I changed the others for consistency. In cases where the parent always updates editorState in the same tick (as we recommend in the docs), there should be no behavior change.

Note: This also brings us closer to being able to handle cases where we don't always receive editorState synchronously -- instead we could store our own copy of the editorState locally but overwrite it with props when we receive new ones. It doesn't work yet though.

Test Plan: In plaintext example, type Option-E, Backspace (with US keyboard) or A, O, Backspace, Backspace (with 2-Set Korean keyboard). In both cases, the entire composition is deleted correctly."

this removes the special tex example linting. that had it's own
copy of eslint linting just itself. after removing eslint i removed
dependencies i didn't see were being used. after that it failed to
build, not reconizing the jsx/import statements. so i added the two
babel presets to handle that. (react, and es2015 presets).

next this starts linting the `examples/` directory. this should
introduce no new warnings/errors. as only the tex example had two
things that didn't comply (trailing commas, which have been fixed)."

Summary:
> I've done this before, it'll only take a few minutes
> — zpao, before he realized upgrading Babel was a prereq

The main goal here was to generate `.js.flow` files and fix #366. Then I needed to upgrade Babel, which meant using the new fbjs preset, which then needed to be updated as it wasn't as done as we thought since Draft has different considerations than fbjs. So now we need https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/pull/147 and https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/pull/148 to land there and ship before we can take this.

The [diff of lib/](https://gist.github.com/zpao/32c511aa1151aef1009eccb4f1cf0a5f) is pretty boring. Mostly it's a result of a few things:
- the helpers are different, this is particularly noticeable for classes
- code generation around comments got better - previously block comments near rewritten nodes (notably `require`) would be moved but now stay where they should
- conversely there are a bunch of newlines being inserted now. win some, lose some.
- a few errant `__esModule` markers

this fixes two things:
1. it fixes #463 where if you inserted a blank string for a piece
of media the editor state would be set to null.
2. the media example no longer uses window.prompt which previously
broke selection state. instead using an input like the link example.

it should be noted though that with this commit it's possible to
insert a blank url for media. i initially was going to add protection
for this, but after looking at the link example it appears the link
example doesn't care if you enter a blank link.

looking at the media objects generated for mp3/mp4 the play bar is still
there, and image is a whitespace. i'll happily add in a safeguard if
it's determined that's ""unwanted"" behavior. however I decided to stick
with consistency with the other examples for this commit."

hense block metadata are store in contentState and are supported by undo/redo.

Why not using entities?
- Entity are not made for block. what does type and mutability would map to?
- Entity are planned to be integrated into contentState anyway (see #185)

Summary:
The `3.8.x` versions of Immutable.js have changed `#toOrderedMap(): OrderedMap` to `#toOrderedMap(): Map` which breaks Draft.js — so I propose we use `~3.7.4` instead of `^3.7.4`.

Draft.js's definition of `BlockMap` is `OrderedMap<string, ContentBlock>` which is not compatible with `Map`.

In the interim (until Immutable.js makes a decision as to whether `#toOrderedMap(): Map` is correct) using the `3.7.x` range allows Draft.js `master` to pass flow checks.

Summary:
There is currently a selection state bug for deletion behavior around atomic blocks. Namely, removing an atomic block from a neighboring block will remove the atomic block but leave the cursor in an invalid state.

Make it so that atomic blocks will be removed during:

- Forward deletion from the last offset of a preceding block
- Backward deletion from the zero offset of a following block

tasti and I discussed whether there should be some special behavior for forward deletion from an empty preceding block, i.e. removing the current block and moving the cursor upward, but this seemed magical.

We can try this out and adjust the behavior as needed.

Summary:Looks like people were interested in seeing an example using media (https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/46).

I created an example that shows how to use Custom Block Components to attach audio, image, and video into the editor.

Side note:

The docs (http://facebook.github.io/draft-js/docs/advanced-topics-block-components.html) led me to believe it's much simpler to render custom blocks. However, more steps (see `insertMedia(...)`) were needed to wrap around the media for it to work well. The `tex` example (https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/master/examples/tex/js/modifiers/insertTeXBlock.js) has the same code to handle this. Can we provide this as a utility function?

Summary:Hey! Thanks so much for the hard work on this project. I’m just making my way through the documentation now, and I couldn’t get the Quick Start examples to run until I made the following changes.

I have very little React experience, and even less with ES2015 stuff—it’s entirely possible I just misunderstood something in all these cases. Regardless, the examples didn’t work as-is for me, and to the best of my understand, these changes fix that.

The one change I made that was maybe more of an opinion was turning:

```js
const {editorState} = this.state;
return <Editor editorState={editorState} onChange={this.onChange} />
```

…into:

```js
return <Editor editorState={this.state.editorState} onChange={this.onChange} />
```

…which just reduced the complexity for me at the beginning, and had more in common with the initial Input example.

In cases where the user triple-clicks on a block, then toggles the block type, it feels weird to have the trailing block also change block type.
