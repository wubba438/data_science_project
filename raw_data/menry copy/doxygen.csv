Until now the chm format of the doxygen documentation was generated by a separate script, this is now integrated in the CMake procedure.
- option -Dbuild_doc_chm to enable the possibility to generate the CHM documentation (only works for windows)
- procedure is as follows
  - generate the base documentation for the CHM output
  - copy the documentation of the examples to the tree with the base CHM output (cannot use it from its default place due to the fact that in the next face the first page of the CHM file will be wrong
  - add the html, png, css and gif files of the examples to the so called hhp file (has to happen during runtime, hence a small python script, created inline so there is no extra file in the source tree)
  - create the resulting doxygen_manual.chm

Some improvements during the process
- the html files of the examples are added so that the full documentation of the examples is accessible and not just the top pages of the examples
- keep the index terms of base chm file (mostly the commands and configuration parameters)
- see to it that the doxygen logo is copied by doxygen and not by means of cmake"

In the docbook ouput this was shown with the attribute `nowrap>=''`, in HTML this empty tag was skipped.
Normally a HTML attribute will have a value but in some cases it is possible without attribute and when this is the last attribute the `>` was accidently added to the attribute (in case of the value the `>` was already considered).
Furthermore `In XHTML, attribute minimization is forbidden, and the nowrap attribute must be defined as <td nowrap=""nowrap"">.`, this is now handled for HTML and docbook as well."

When we have a construct like:

};
```
this will lead to files with `[` and `]` in it, as such not nice, but it is used in ids inside the code as well like:
```
id=""aclass_stl_container_view_3_01_element[_n]_4_html_a1bf60158ff15896f2b53af11c09524fb""

running
```

this leads to the message:
```

escaping the `[` and `]` as done with other special characters solves this problem"

The original version has as features:
- getting the git version number for usage in doxygen
- making the doxygen version number inclusion dependent on the VERSION file

The disadvantage of the chosen methodology was that an extra correction step was necessary, by defining getter methods to retrieve the values this correction can be hidden.
The information is coming from different sources:
- the VERSION file
- the git ""repository and build system (when present)

Furthermore there are a couple of places where the version information is used (a.o. doxygen and doxywizard executable, though the doxygenwizard was only done ""half hearted"")

The handling of the VERSION file has been made in such a way that it is comparable with the generation of the git version changes.

For a better abstraction the version handling is all done in a separate directory."

In some  languages the `$` is used to start a variable name (php, perl).
When having a description like:

```
this will lead to a message like:
```
warning: found </b> at different nesting level (4) than expected (2)
```
because the part `$RRDp:` is seen as start of a RCS tag and runs till the next `$`.

Though the `::` indicates here a class / namespace separator and in case of `$...:`  directly followed by a `:` this should not be seen as RCS tag."

In general ATX headers ('#' headers and other markdown ) are converted to doxygen `\section` etc. commands
In case not all levels of doxygen commands are present so like;
```
\section  sect1 Section
....
\subsubsection subsubsect1 Sub sub section

```
the information of the `\subsubsection` is not shown. Same happens in case the `\section` is not present at all.
Part of the steering of the ATX headers is done by means of the configuration setting TOC_INCLUDE_HEADINGS (default is 5) setting this setting to '0' will not convert the '#' headers to `\section` etc. (but this as side note).

Basic problem is fixing the not shown headers in case of missing levels in the `\section` commands.
- In case the `\section` command does start the page
- In case the `\section` command does not start the page.

Case the `\section` command does start the page: this is handled in the routine `int DocSection::parse()`
- see to it that not only the exact matching level is handled but also the 'jumps' in levels
- loop all 'section' of the found type and its sub sections and only jump out in case of the 'jump' level case
- give a warning in case of a 'level jump'

Case the `\section` command does not start the page: this is handled in the routine ` void DocRoot::parse()`
- as e.g. `\paragraph` could be followed by a `\subsubsection` each section type has to be handled one after another (otherwise higher types would not be handled)
- note the order is important therefore a `\subsubsection` has to be handled after a `\paragraph.
- due to the different handling the 'TK_LISTITEM' has to be handled at the end (each part can also give a 'TK_LISTITEM'"

The 1.8.15 manual had 26 examples but due to the fact that a new example was created we got 27 and thus the characters A-Z are not sufficient.
In a number of LaTeX versions this leads to messages like:
```
Appendix \GenericError {               }{LaTeX Error: Counter too large}{See th
e LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.}{You've lost some text.  Try
 typing  <return>  to proceed.\MessageBreak If that doesn't work, type  X <retu
rn>  to quit.}.

! LaTeX Error: Counter too large.
```

Solution for this is to reorganize the examples a little bit. This is done here by means of the ""groups"":
 - Style examples
 - Language Examples

as a consequence also the sections / subsections etc had to go 1 level deeper and this is accomplished by defining a new environment in which the different sections go 1 level deeper."

`char text[bufSize]` cannot be used as some older compilers don't accept it.

When we have the Mardown file:

Here we see that the `PageDoc` is closed before the `Contents` although the `PageDoc` was opened before the `Contents`.
In this constellation it doesn't give problems as both translate to `</div>` tag and in other output formats nothing is outputted, but in case in another format something is outputted this might lead to problems also the comment is now so that is indicates the error."

Instead, the doxygen manual says to do this

/*************//**

which some users aren't even aware is required. It also behaves poorly with clang-format.

I'm proposing to add a Doxyfile boolean option JAVADOC_BANNER which will default to NO. When set to YES, it will consider the first and second comments above to be equivalent.

However, I don't believe that the JAVADOC_BANNER option should default to YES, as there are likely a number of projects who have used the former syntax with full expectation that it would *not* appear in their documentation.

At least having the JAVADOC_BANNER default to NO allows users to opt-in voluntarily by adding JAVADOC_BANNER = YES to their Doxyfile. If the consensus is to make it a default at a later time, first a warning can be added during build that should trigger users to modify their comment style, and then eventually the default could be set to JAVADOC_BANNER = YES, or the config option could be removed entirely and it would just always be enabled."

I some cases a file name is used with the `\file` command and this filename exists multiple times although the `\file` command is in the file itself (actually file name can be omitted).
Another possibility is that the file description is in another file in the same directory.
When file is not found or ambiguous, try to prepend the path of the current file to it and see if the file can be found.

Example is shown in the warnings file like:
```
gmic-2.6.1/gmic-qt/src/Common.h:3: warning: the name `Common.h' supplied as the second argument in the \file statement matches the following input files:
   gmic-2.6.1/gmic-qt/src/Common.h
   gmic-2.6.1/zart/include/Common.h

The classic article about virtuality from Herb Sutter [1] suggests that
virtual functions are always private and public class interface is never
virtual. Until now, it was not really possible to document these
functions in Doxygen:

 * Enabling EXTRACT_PRIVATE would show all internals, not just virtual
   functions, which is not wanted.
 * Enabling HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES would effectively
   disable warnings about *all* undocumented members, which is not wanted.

The usual workaround was to put the members into protected scope just
for Doxygen:

    #ifdef DOXYGEN_GENERATING_OUTPUT
    protected:
    #else
    private:
    #endif
        /** @brief Documented private virtual function */
        virtual doStuff();

The new EXTRACT_PRIVATE_VIRTUAL option makes these visible (and able to
be linked to), but shows them *only* if they are documented.

# Test Environments (How to test)
- The example has 5 plantumls.
## Original Configration
- I follow the original path to process plantuml.
- Configuration of Doxyfile
    - OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       =  OUTPUT
    - SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES
    - GENERATE_HTML          = YES
      only set the html
    - GENERATE_LATEX         = NO
- Run
    - $ doxygen -d time

## PLANTUML_RUN_FAST
- Changed Configuration of Doxyfile
    - PLANTUML_RUN_FAST      = YES

## Modify One Plantuml
- Modify one plantuml in 5 plantuml of example  with the same environment of PLANTUML_RUN_TEST

# How to Reduce the performance
## PLANTUML_RUN_FAST
- Make Just one pu (plantuml) file to run java once
    - Just run once when we generate HTML.
### another test with setting YES to all GENERATE_*
- When we generate several types , we run java several times according the different java arguments.
    - set YES to all GENERATE_*
    - There are 20 plantuml in this example and configuration.  But, it runs java just 4 times.

## Modify One Plantuml
- Cached file name : OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/inline_umlgraph_cache_all.pu
    - inline_umlgraph_cache_all.pu was created when doxygen was finished.
    - inline_umlgraph_cache_all.pu had all plantuml contents. and it will be used to check what is changed.
- If you want to keep pu files , DOT_CLEANUP = NO
    - inline_umlgraph_<type><dictory>.pu includes changed plantuml. So it can reduce the java processing time.

# Explanation of the code
## old
- generatePlantUMLOutput() makes each plantuml from each @start~enduml with the name as inline_umlgraph_#.pu.

## new (PLANTUML_RUN_FAST)
- It will make a plantuml png at the end of processes of doxygen. So we can reduce the count of java runs.
- class PlantumlManager saves all plantuml information for running java at the end of doxygen and for comparing the plantuml contents as a cache.
    - generatePlantUMLOutput() is not enough to make a database in class PlantumlManager.
    - So I use writePlantUMLSource() to get more information (pu name and contents).  I modified writePlantUMLSource() because I do not want to read the file to get the contents in generatePlantUMLOutput().
    -  The writePlantUMLSource() compares each plantuml contents and filename with cached information (inline_umlgraph_cache_all.pu). Then it will decide whether will  recreate or reuse.
- Like dot , we make plantuml pictures at the end of doxygen.

# What is it
- #6465 is the first trial.  So I followed up the albert advice.
	- in case of debug you use printf statements, I think that here there better options would be
		- create an -d flag (e.g. -d plantuml) that gives the information, so no need for using the configuration option
		- Follow up : create -d plantuml [debug.h, debug.cpp]
	- usage of printf
		- printf should not be used,all output is steered over calls to routines as defined in message.cpp,
		- Follow up : use Debug::Print(Debug::Plantuml, ...    and msg()
	- usage of std::string / std::map
		- in doxygen the string manipulation is. mostly, done by means of Qt classes (e.g. classes QCString, QString). For consistency these classes should be used.
		- map manipulation is also done by means of Qt classes (dictionary and list classes)
		- Follow up : use QDict QList QCString [plantuml.h, plantuml.cpp]
	- dirent / opendir /readdir
		- when browsing through directories the routines line readFileOrDirectory should probably be used or the techniques used in this routine
		- Follow up : I will follow when I try to reduce redundancy of creating plantuml image.
- #6467 is the second trial.  This is work items to satisfiy comments.
	- In the debug statements the __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ is a GCC extension. But this project can run in windows.
		- I got it.  I removed __PRETTY_FUNCTION__.
	- In the PLANTUML_RUN_JAVA_ONCE all the .pu files are given to the plantuml.jar with their full path (see -d extcmd when running). I think this will lead to problems when there are quite a few files (""command line"" overflow). Seen this merging the files into one file like done for formulas. A small test with one file revealed that it didn't bring a lot / nothing time wise, but here the problem with the ""command line"" overflow shouldn't / can't happen.
		- Yes. The command line has overflow problem.  So I change into one file.
	- I think it still would make sense to implement the 'md5' possibility for, especially, the non PLANTUML_RUN_JAVA_ONCE version, i.e. if the file already exists don't try to recreate the image.
		- This is a next item.
			- PlantumlManager::instance()->insert() : this function will be changed to skip image.

When a C++11 `enum class` was present in an anonymous namespace (usually
in *.cpp files), the XML output was emitting warnings similar to the
following:

   Internal inconsistency: member False does not belong to any container!

And the XML output was rendering bogus IDs for enum values starting with
`dummy_`, such as:

    dummy_1a96ab6574751fdf6a53ceec8a3896c45daf8320b26d30ab433c5a54546d21f414c

The fix is to call memberOutputFileBase() on the enumeration itself and
not on the enum value, that way it provides correct file base that
corresponds to file base of the enumeration. There's also a new test
that checks this.

Note: this assumes that enum values belong to the same compound as enums
themselves. In my experience that was always the case and there's no
broken test after this change, so I hope I didn't break anything."

Regarding backwards compatibility -- as files with such ASCII
characters are very rare, I don't expect this minor difference in the

replaced by a space in many applications anyway.

This is based on work done in 141dbfd5a4f79c98da14a1b414c6db4e1b34618b
through ed9acb6e1bb81a2eec334180f7b8c1bf0598b444 and makes a few
behavioral changes to it.

There's a new attribute called `filename` and the `language` was removed,
because it could provide misleading information. This allows for more
flexibility on the user side. In particular:

 * For historical reasons, `*.txt` files are marked by Doxygen as C++
   (see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=760836 for details).
   In particular, code snippet included from a CMakeLists.txt file would
   be marked and highlighted as C++. So in this case, the language
   attribute would be very misleading.
 * Doxygen is aware only of a very small subset of languages and thus a
   lot of information can be lost when relying on its
   extension-to-language-name conversion -- in particular, all
   extensions that are not recognized are assumed to be C++. On the other
   hand, putting more effort into its language detection algorithms is
   not worth the time, as there will always be new languages that fail to
   detect. So let's leave that on the user of the XML output instead.
 * Using just file extension is not enough, it has to be a full filename.
   For example, `*.txt` can be either a plain text file or a
   `CMakeLists.txt`.
 * The path is not stripped from the filename, as it also may contain
   additional information that helps to detect the language better.

In addition to that, filenames of code snippets included via the \include
command and related are propagated to the <programlisting> element as
well.

With this change, (1) code snippets using simply

    \code
    some code
    \endcode

will not produce any `filename` attribute and it's up to the user what to
do -- assume C++, detect language from contents or not highlight
anything.

    <programlisting>
    some code
    </programlisting>

(2) Code snippets using

    \code{.cmake}
    some code
    \endcode

will produce the following:

    <programlisting filename="".cmake"">
    some code
    </programlisting>

(3) And finally, \include, \dontinclude and related \skip, \skipline etc.
commands

    \include path/to/some-file.py

will produce

    <programlisting filename=""path/to/some-file.py"">
    some code
    </programlisting>

The tests were updated to check all three cases.

On the user side, when using Pygments for example, it's then just a
matter of calling pygments.lexers.find_lexer_class_for_filename() with
value of the `filename` attribute value and optionally also the code
snippet for additional language analysis."

According to the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH spec [1], ""Formatting MUST be deferred until runtime if an end user should observe the value in their own locale or timezone.""

However setTime_t uses localtime, so the output is in the timezone of the build machine running doxygen, and not the timezone of the reader consuming the final output.

To adhere to the spec, the easiest option is to add a setTimeUtc_t function that is the same as setTime_t, but only uses gmtime instead of first trying localtime.

With this patch the :cairo:gd is stripped from the image extension, but not from the -T of the dot command.

The uniqueness of rows is maintained by first doing a select.
In case the item is not found, it's INSERTed.

This is done for files, refids, params and includes, data
that is not unique by itself, like cross-references for example.
In other words, you can have many memberdefs in one file,
but you can only have one cross-reference between two functions
since the reference location is unique.

So, when SELECTing files and refids, use the file name and refids
as primary key since that's the fastest way to do it.

Also 'OR REPLACE' not necessary in 'INSERT OR REPLACE'.

  Define access routines to the different representations
  Mapping (for recognition of the entities) based on running through the list of available entities, after validation of the order of the entities. A few entities contain now besides letters also numbers at the end.

- docparser.h
  Define symbols for all entities as well as a helper struct and enum. The member m_letter is not used anymore and thus removed.

  and at the end:

Some use names routine names have been changed (from .l files with -P option) to reflect the file name that generated the routines, this makes it easier to create a general procedure.
A number of include / header files are files are generated from different file types (html, xml, js), due some limitations of the windows build system the generated file names had to be changed (the extension in the windows build system is only available including the '.' so e.g. the file jquery_fx.js generates now jquery_fx.js.h instead of jquery_fx_js.h)
In the windows version the creation of .cpp files from .l files has been adjusted to correct for the YY_BUF_SIZE problems.
Furthermore on windows (and also used on *nix) some commends have been replaced with python scripts so that on windows only python is need (besides flex and and bison). On *nix also perl is required for the generation using tmake.

Below a short description of the changes will be given and grouped.

- src/htmlgen.cpp
- src/layout.cpp
- src/searchindex.cpp

Adjusted in the following files some routine names (..YY..) to be consistent with the file names:
=================================================================================================
- src/commentscan.l
- src/constexp.h
- src/constexp.l
- src/constexp.y
- src/fortrancode.l
- src/fortranscanner.l
- src/pyscanner.l
- src/pre.l
- src/scanner.l
- src/tclscanner.l
- src/vhdlparser.y
- src/vhdlscanner.l

- src/config.xml
small textual correction

- src/configoptions.cpp
generated output file, can be removed

- src/lang_cfg.h
Automatically generated file with selected languages (*nix). On windows a procedure has to be defined.

- src/libdoxycfg.t.in
corrected call to python (to get it from the right place, it is not necessarily in the path)

- src/libdoxygen.pro.in
adjusted include file names
removed translator_??.h files, they are added automatically
changed file name ce_lex.cpp -> constexp.cpp (generated file)

- src/libdoxygen.t.in
made LEX calls used the file name for the -P option
changed INCREASEBUF script to a python script
changed teh geneartion of some include file, now by means of a pythons script. Names of the generated include file had to be changed as well.
added possibility to generate version.cpp here as well.

Added HEADERS to dependency so non existing but later generated include files are recognized as well:
=====================================================================================================
- tmake/lib/unix/generic.t
- tmake/lib/win32-borland/generic.t
- tmake/lib/win32-g++/generic.t
- tmake/lib/win32-mingw/generic.t
- tmake/lib/win32-msvc/generic.t
- tmake/lib/win32-symantec/generic.t
- tmake/lib/win32-visage/generic.t
- tmake/lib/win32-watcom/generic.t

- winbuild/Doxygen.vcproj
made consistent wit *nix version.
Generating all possible files
removed unused /empty parts
setting for the Lex.rules and other rules files some default values

- winbuild/Doxywizard.vcproj
made consistent wit *nix version.
Generating all possible files
removed unused /empty parts
removed system dependent paths (C:\... etc) replaced then with external environment variables

- winbuild/Lex.rules
adjusted file to comply with new requirements, only user variable is -d. -i is set to read only (value can be changed  in doxygen.vcproj). Handling of other arguments is all default.
generation including increasebuffer possibility

- winbuild/doxyindexer.vcproj
corrected path

- winbuild/doxysearch.vcproj
removed system dependent paths (C:\... etc) replaced then with external environment variables

- winbuild/qtools.vcproj
corrected type, wrong used directory

The following files are automatically generated (with slightly other names like index.xsd.h etc.):
==================================================================================================
- src/index_xsd.h
- src/doxygen_bst.h
- src/dynsections_js.h
- src/extsearch_js.h
- src/footer_html.h
- src/header_html.h
- src/jquery_fx_js.h

- src/search_css.h
- src/search_functions_php.h
- src/search_js.h
- src/search_opensearch_php.h
- src/svgpan_js.h
the following files are generated with different names:
- src/bib2xhtml.h
becomes
- src/bib2xhtml.pl/h

- src/layout_default.h
becomes
- src/layout_default.xml.h

The file:
=========
- addon/doxywizard/config.l
is replaced by:
- addon/doxywizard/config_doxyw.l
so there are in the system not 2 different config.l files. Renamed some routines from configYY -> config_doxywYY...

New files:
==========
- src/increasebuffer.py
increase YY_BUF_SIZE and YY_READ_BUF_SIZE from 16k / 8k to 256k.

- src/settings.py
create settings.h file

- src/to_c_cmd.py
create include files from different files (html, xml, js) so they can be included in the code as defaults

- src/version.py
create version.cpp file based on the configure file

- winbuild/Config.rules
rules file to convert the config.xml file into configoptions.cpp (doxygen) or configdoc.cpp (doxywizard). Seen the differences 2 rules are created within this file.

- winbuild/Gen_head.rules
rules files to generate include files from different files using to_c_cmd.py

- winbuild/Settings.rules
rules file for generating the settings.h file. It is possible to select to use CLANG and SqlLite3

- winbuild/Version.rules
rules file to be able to start version.py

The files:
==========
- version.bat
- runbison.bat
- increasebuffer.pl
are not used anymore.

I've only added the files as indicated, I didn't remove the files from the repository."
