While the previous approach of hand-rolling test data cleanup + setup works
it’s prone to become insufficient with regards to future test scenarios. Recent
commits 6a6da094 and later 4620a9221 highlight the issue.

Using the database cleaner gem provides a cleaner (pun intended) approach to
setup a clean room environment before and after each specific test.

Annotating specs with with `:js` or `truncate` will switch from a transaction
based cleanup strategy to a truncation based one to enable feature/request specs
for which a web server is spun up in separate process by RSpec, in other words
the process executing the spec is not the same as the process handling the
request so RSpec/DatabaseCleaner wouldn’t know when to rollback the transaction.

The downside of this approach might be that RSpec takes a few more seconds to
run all specs."

I discussed with @pushcx about adding Skylight instrumentation
to lobste.rs under the new [Skylight for Open Source](https://www.skylight.io/oss)
program.

If you’re not already familiar with Skylight, it is a smart profiler
for Rails apps. Skylight makes it easy to pinpoint performance issues
in Rails applications.

We work on a lot of open source projects ourselves, and in our experience
it can be pretty hard to get contributors to work on application performance
issues. Few contributors consider working on performance problems, and the
ones that might be interested may not even know where to start. By making
performance information more accessible, we hope to inspire potential
contributors to tackle slow parts of your app, and have a good way to
see if their contributions helped.

Once this patch is merged and deloyed*, you will be able to view the
performance data we collected at the [public Skylight dashboard](https://oss.skylight.io/app/applications/UVOwCQJiWlFy).
The dashboard will be accessible to anyone (no Skylight account
required) to make it easy for contributors.

(*Actually, I lied a little. We still need to set the `SKYLIGHT_AUTHENTICATION`
environment variable to the appropiate API key on production, but I
will work with @pushcx on that off-thread.)

Sphinx's searchd is very buggy, often crashing on rebuilding its
indexes, not starting up, or just spinning at 100% CPU.

It is also a big external dependency that might not be available on
other hosting platforms.

This removes the ability to search both comments and stories at
once, though I don't know how useful that was anyway.  We gain
boolean searching and the ability to more carefully craft queries
using particular keywords (in the future) like ""user:blah"" or
""tag:blah"" to narrow things down."

which prevented the URL canonicalization code from being run when a
medium URL was submitted, which prevented us from stripping off
those stupid referral codes medium attaches to URLs (which could
be stripped out in Story#url= but medium allows custom domains, so
that wouldn't work for things like m.signalvnoise.com).

Rather than keep ""poorly titled"" and ""poorly tagged"" as reasons for
flagging, make the user do the work of suggesting new ones.

At some point, suggested taggings will flip to real taggings once
they reach a certain count (to be determined later).  This also has
to take into account tagging sets that don't contain current tags,
for when they need to be removed.

For titles, I'm not yet sure how to handle this in an automated
fashion except for the (probably rare) case of multiple users
submitting the same exact thing, but at least collect them for now.

Instead of hard-coding the scheme and host everywhere, use _path
methods to show relative URLs.

Except that our previous setting of
Rails.application.routes.default_url_options in
config.after_initialize made this moot because Rails inserts that
host into all _path helpers for some reason.  So revert that
setting.

But then anything that wants an absolute URL doesn't know the
hostname and the root_url helper throws an exception.  So make a
Rails.application.root_url shortcut to pass the per-app settings in
Rails.application to root_url.

Now we can just use _path helpers most places but still use _url
ones where we need them, such as in RSS views and e-mail templates."

stories should either be reported for spam (coming later), upvoted,
or left alone rather than being downvoted for being uninteresting.
since users don't like leaving uninteresting things alone, they can
now hide stories from their view without affecting the story's
score.

hiding is implemented as a Vote with its vote set to 0 and the
reason set to ""H""

add a /hidden url which shows all of a user's hidden stories
