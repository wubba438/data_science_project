Avoid using Twig_Environment::getFunction to identify Assetic functions

As of Assetic 1.3.0, the Twig functions are using a special node class, which can be used to identify them instead.
The `getFunction` method is intended to be marked as an internal one in https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/pull/1889

Fix the support of legacy scssphp formatters

Scssphp 0.5 removed the deprecated classes. But as there was no warning, people might not be aware that they were using a deprecated class.
This keeps support for the deprecated formatters in Assetic by matching them to their replacement, and warns the user about it.

Test against stable versions of leafo/scssphp

This removes leafo/scssphp-compass from the dev requirements as this package seems unmaintained (not updated since 2012), has no stable releases, and does not allow using stable versions of leafo/scssphp (which is necessary on PHP 5.3 as the dev version requires 5.4+).

It also avoids using unbound constraints for other dev dependencies

ScssphpFilter - do not add empty load path as import path

This has in part to do with #164 and in part with leafo/scssphp#237.

When you iterate in https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic/blob/master/src/Assetic/Factory/AssetFactory.php#L254 over a AssetReference that references a AssetCollection the call to getSourceDirectory() in https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic/blob/master/src/Assetic/Factory/AssetFactory.php#L277 would return nothing (null).

The ScssphpFilter would then call addImportPath() on the scss compiler with null which results in an exception ""call_user_func() expects parameter 1 to be a valid callback, no array or string given"", which would in turn keep imports from being parsed and replaced properly

This PR was merged into the 1.2-dev branch.

Discussion
----------

Make JSqueeze filter work with 1.x and 2.x (namespaced)

JSqueeze 2.x just came out, and it's now namespaced. This should let the filter work with both 1.x and 2.x. Obviously it'd also be simple to just make it work with 2.x only if you wanted to go that way.

I thought about adding some helper bits to make it easier to use upstream's default special var regex on 2.x, but thought I'd just keep it simple for now. We could do something like have `setSpecialVarRx` accept 'true', and have that set the value to `JSqueeze::SPECIAL_VAR_PACKER` on 2.x.

@nicolas-grekas wdyt?

It'd be good to have this on the stable branches too.

Currently sass process files with default precision of 5 digits if I'm not wrong
In bootstrap the base-line-height has 9 digits of decimals which cause a problem when the sass precision is less that 9
So I think this is the best way to add the precision we need"

PHP 5.2.2 introduced named groups defined as (?<name>...) or (?'name'...) like
what it is used in the Assetic\Filter\BaseCssFilter. Through my research, I
found that this was enabled by the version 7 of PCRE (see
http://www.pcre.org/changelog.txt version 7.0 line 34). You can see what PCRE
version is used in each version of PHP here :
http://www.php.net/manual/fr/pcre.installation.php

For a reason I do not fully understand, PHP in CentOS 5.8 was compiled with
version 6.6 of PCRE that do not support that new way of defining named groups.
You can know which version of PCRE PHP is using  by executing that line :

    php -r 'echo PCRE_VERSION;'

So to fix that problem, I modified the code to use the old way of defining
named group, using the uppercase P."
