- It's ""npm"" not ""NPM"". It doesn't stand for anything, and it never
  has - it was initially chosen simply because it was easy to type.
  It has a lot of unofficial backronyms with ""Node Package Manager""
  being one of the most common ones, but it's never officially stood
  for anything as an acronym *or* initialism.
- Fixed a few errors in the change log, like non-breaking changes being
  included in the ""Breaking Changes"" section and an inaccuracy in the
  summary of a particular change.
- Fixed RawGit URLs to point to GitHack, which is a lighter proxy that
  offloads caching to Cloudflare instead of also implementing it itself.
  (It also just uses nginx for all the important server logic, so it
  scales better.)
- Add a few more v0.2 references as appropriate"

* Recast the router API to be a lot more intuitive.

Fixes #2387
Fixes #2072
Fixes quite a few issues reported on Gitter.

For `m.route.Link`:

- More intuitive
- More accessible
- More ergonomic
- It can be disabled
- It can be cancelled
- It can be changed
- Oh, and you can use it isomorphically.

For `m.route.prefix`

- You can *read* it.
- You can write to it, of course.
- It's literally just setting a property.

For the router itself (and the rest of Mithril):

- You can now `require(""mithril"")` and all its submodules without a DOM
  at all. There is a catch: you can't instantiate any routes, you can't
  mount anything, and you can't invoke `m.render` in any capacity. You
  can only use `m.route.Link`, `m.route.prefix`, hyperscript stuff, and
  `mithril/stream`, and you can use `m.request` with `background: true`
  if you use a global XHR polyfill. (You can't use `m.request` without
  `background: true` except with a DOM to redraw with.) The goal here is
  to try to get out of the way for simple testing and to defer the
  inevitable `TypeError`s for the relevant DOM methods to runtime.

  The factory requires no arguments, and in terms of globals, you can
  just figure out based on what errors are thrown what globals to
  define. Their values don't matter - they just need to be set to
  *something*, even if it's just `null` or `undefined`, before Mithril
  executes.

Had to make quite a few other changes throughout the docs and tests to
update them accordingly. Oh, and that massive router overhaul enabled me
to do all this.

Also, slip in a few drive-by fixes to the mocks so they're a little
easier to work with and can accept more URLs. This was required for a
few of the tests.

* Drop `m.version`

It's caused way too much grief over the years, and I've finally decided
it's worth pitching. For those who need it, it's easy to get, especially
if you use it through Node or a build system. And for those who are just
loading it globally, you have to explicitly specify the version anyways,
so you'd be just as golden if you followed it up with a simple inline
script that does `m.version = ""the version you loaded""`.

Oh, and also, you shouldn't be coding specifically for version numbers,
either - it's a known anti-pattern. Instead, you should prefer feature
detection and just do the right thing.

* De-servicify router (mostly)

Still uses the redraw service, but it no longer has an intermediate
service of its own.

Also, did a *lot* of test deduplication in this. About 30-40% of the
router service tests were already tested on the main router API instance
itself.

Bundle size decreased from 9560 to 9548 bytes min+gzip.

* Merge `m.mount` + `m.redraw`, update router

Simplifies the router and redraw mechanism, and makes it much easier to
keep predictable.

Bundle size down to 9433 bytes min+gzip, docs updated accordingly.

* Make `mithril/render` just return the `m.render` function directly.

* Deservicify `m.render`, revise `m.route`

- You now have to use `mithril/render/render` directly if you want an
  implicit redraw function. (This will likely be going away in v3.)
- Revise `m.route` to only `key` components

https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/issues/1138#issuecomment-231363395

Specifically, here's what this patch entails:

- I changed `data` and `useBody` to `params` and `body` in `m.request`.
  Migration is trivial: just use `params` or `body` depending on which you
  intend to send. Most servers do actually care where the data goes, so you can
  generally pretty easily translate this accordingly. If you *really* need the
  old behavior, pass the old value in `params` and if `method === ""GET""` or
  `method === ""TRACE""`, also in `body`.
- I opened up all methods to have request bodies.
- I fixed `m.parseQueryString` to prefer later values over earlier values and
  to ensure that objects and arrays are persisted across both hash and query
  param parsing. That method also accepts an existing key/value map to append
  to, to simplify deduplication.
- I normalized path interpolation to be identical between routes and requests.
- I no longer include interpolated values in query strings. If you need to
  duplicate values again, rename the interpolation to be a distinct property
  and pass the value you want to duplicate as it.
- I converted `m.route` to use pre-compiled routes instead of its existing
  system of dynamic runtime checking. This shouldn't have a major effect on
  performance short-term, but it'll ease the migration to built-in userland
  components and make it a little easier to reconcile. It'll also come handy
  for large numbers of routes.
- I added support for matching routes like `""/:file.:ext""` or
  `""/:lang-:region""`, giving each defined semantics.
- I added support for matching against routes with static query strings, such
  as `""/edit?type=image"": { ... }`.
- I'm throwing a few new informative errors.
- And I've updated the docs accordingly.

I also made a few drive-by edits:

- I fixed a bug in the `Stream.HALT` warning where it warned all but the first
  usage when the intent was to warn only on first use.
- Some of the tests were erroneously using `Stream.HALT` when they should've
  been using `Stream.SKIP`. I've fixed the tests to only test that
  `Stream.HALT === Stream.SKIP` and that it only warns on first use.
- The `m.request` and `m.jsonp` docs signatures were improved to more clearly
  explain how `m.request(url, options?)` and `m.jsonp(url, options?)` translate
  to `m.request(options)` and `m.jsonp(options)` respectively.

-----

There is some justification to these changes:

- In general, it matters surprisingly more than you would expect how things
  translate to HTTP requests. So the comment there suggesting a thing that
  papers over the difference has led to plenty of confusion in both Gitter and
  in GitHub issues.

- A lot of servers expect a GET with a body and no parameters, and leaving
  `m.request` open to working with that makes it much more flexible.

- Sometimes, servers expect a POST with query parameters *instead* of a JSON
  object. I've seen this quite a bit, even with more popular REST APIs like
  Stack Overflow's.

- I've encountered a few servers that expect both parameters and a body, each
  with distinct semantic meaning, so the separation makes it much easier to
  translate into a request.

- Most of the time, path segments are treated individually, and URL-escaping
  the contents is much less error-prone. It also avoids being potentially
  lossy, and when the variable in question isn't trusted, escaping the path
  segment enables you to pass it through the URL and not risk being redirected
  to unexpected locations, avoiding some risks of vulnerabilities and client
  side crashes.

If you really don't care how the template and parameters translate to an
eventual URL, just pass the same object for the `params` and `body` and use
`:param...` for each segment. Either way, the more explicit nature should help
a lot in making the intent clearer, whether you care or not."

* Remove `m.prop` + `m.withAttr`

- For many uses, `m.withAttr` is *more* verbose than just directly using
  an event handler
- If you're using it with a bound callback, you're literally wasting a
  single character in the human readable version (and you're *saving*
  them in the minified output).
- It sometimes obscures your intent, if overused.
- Functions are easier to compress than `m.withAttr`, resulting in
  slightly smaller bundles.
- `m.withAttr` is overused anyways.
- `m.prop` is basically useless without `m.withAttr`, and the API
  doesn't have the same benefits it had with 0.2.x.

While the docs do say that a second render pass for preloaded data comes
from request completion, the example code for preloading data suggests that
a promise chain returned from `oninit` has a role to play in controlling the
second render pass.

The docs should make explicit where the redraw is initiated so the reader
does not mistakingly believe that `oninit()` retuning a promise changes
anything."

I was stuck on this for a while earlier today: it turns out that `m.route.param` will not return the right results in the `onmatch` function on a `RouterResolver`, though it will inside of a `render` function on the same. This behavior is documented in the `onmatch` section but not the `m.route.param` section, which is where I was looking when I ran up against this earlier.

From an API design perspective it would make sense to me for `m.route.param` to return valid results inside `onmatch`, but I don't know enough about Mithril's internals to know how complex it would be to implement."

Getting set up with ospec is deceptively simple, and adding just a bit
more documentation should help new users from falling into the trap of
overthinking the test config.  (I know that I ended up down a very
strange rabbit hole when pulling ospec into a project).

This also adjusts the bin definition in the package file so that we can
hopefully just use the `ospec` command instead of a folder ref."

This relies on a hack to bypass the `mocha` detection by `grunt-mocha-phantomjs`.
The tests have to run in less than 10 seconds, which is unlikely to be problematic on current

Alternatively, adding the following to tests/index.html also makes the old test suite compatible
with the mocha runner, but it entails loading `mocha`:

    <script src=""../node_modules/mocha/mocha.js""></script>
    <script>

When a controller calls preventDefault on its onunload method, it prevents the current root element from being unmounted via a route change. But it does not prevent it from being unmounted via m.mount(root, null). In that case, the root element is unmounted, but any unloaders that it had keep hanging on the `unloaders` array, and that prevented any future m.mount(root, component) calls from succeeding. This is what was happening on the pending route() tests.

The fix is pretty simple: just reset the `unloaders` array when removing the root element, just like it's done when no unloader calls preventDefault.

Also, 2 of the 4 pending tests were removed because they were identical to the other 2."

`MithrilVirtualElement` was recently converted to be generic over `<T extends
MithrilController>`. The element's `children` may then contain other
`MithrilVirtualElement<T>` or `MithrilComponent<T>` elements.

Unfortunately, in common usage of 'm()' this can cause problems with Mithril's type
inference system. If a type is not explicitly provided to `m()`, the ""T"" of the
returned MithrilVirtualElement<T> will be inferred from its children. The
candidates for T will be the concrete types of the child MithrilComponent<T>; however, if no
candidate type is a subset of *every* candidate type, then TypeScript will be
unable to infer a valid type, and the call to `m()` will not compile.

To improve this behavior, this commit makes MithrilVirtualElement non-generic;
it's child collection can now contain MithrilComponent<MithrilController>, which
matches all valid MithrilComponent. This the same underlying issue as the
previous commit, which made MithrilRoutes non-generic.

The motivation for fixing this is threefold:

1. Because `m()` has so many overloads, in the case where a call to `m()` will
not compile due to the above issue, the syntax error provided by TypeScript is
not helpful.
2. In many cases, users will be calling `m<MithrilController>()` in their code
simply to get it to compile, which provides no additional utility over a
non-generic type and adds significant boilerplate.
3. Explicitly specifying subtypes to `m()` calls provides little utility; at
best, it can check that contained components implement some common interface.
However, type assertions like that can be provided in other places without
having to attach the information to the MithrilVirtualElement."

The previous definition of MithrilRoutes was generic over <T extends
MithrilController>, with the MithrilRoutes containing a collection of
MithrilComponent<T>.

However, this presents problems with TypeScript's type inference in many common
situations.  For example, consider this usage of m.route():

```
m.route(document.body, ""/a"", {
    ""/a"": ComponentA,
    ""/b"": ComponentB,
})
```
Both `ComponentA` and `ComponentB` implement `MithrilComponent<T extends
MithrilController>`, with each component having a different concrete controller
type (`ControllerA` and `ControllerB`).

However, unless ControllerA's type is a subset of ControllerB's type (or
vice-versa), TypeScript will be unable to infer the type of the MitrilRoutes<T>
returned by m.route(). To get this to compile, a third type which *is* a
subset of both ControllerA and ControllerB would need to be explicity provided:

```
// Both ControllerA and ControllerB implement MithrilController
m.route<MithrilController>(document.body, ""/a"", {
  ""/a"": ComponentA,
  ""/b"": ComponentB,
})
```

This commit makes MithrilRoute non-generic, and instead of containing
MithrilComponent<T extends MithrilRoute>, it contains
MithrilComponent<MithrilController>, which will match all valid
MithrilComponents.

The motivation for this change is twofold:

1. In the case where m.route() does not compile due to type-inference failure,
the resulting syntax error from Typescript is very unhelpful because m.route()
has a number of overloads. Leaving this as is will result in confusion for
downstream users.
2. An assumption that vanishingly little utility is provided by defining
`MithrilRoutes<T extends MithrilController>` over a type more specific than
MithrilController. At most, it could be used to assert that all of your routed
Components meet a more specialized interface, but that same type check could be
accomplished without having to augment MithrilRoutes with that information."

Previously, the Typescript definition file did not support parameterized
components. The `component()` function did accept additional arguments, but the
`MithrilComponent<T>` interface did not allow components to have any additional
arguments in either their `controller()` or `view()` methods.

Properly supporting flexible variadic parameters in typescript is somewhat
challenging. Tuple types are close, but would only work if the signature of
`controller` and `view` accepted arrays of arguments:
```
interface MithrilStatic {
  component<TController extend controller, TRest extends any[]>(
    component: ParameterizedMithrilComponent<TController, TRest>,
    ...args:TRest
  ) : TController
}

interface ParameterizedMithrilComponent<TController extend controller, TRest
extends any[]> {
  // Doesn't match mithril's component interface; we want to unpack the contents
  // of TRest
  controller: (args: TRest) => TController,
  view: (ctrl: TController, args: TRest)
}
```

Therefore, I have gone with a more traditional method of defining several
overloads of m.component(), each with a different number of extra parameters.
Because of this, the first four parameters to m.component() will be correctly
type checked (i.e. if the Component's controller defines the parameter, it must
be supplied to m.component). Additional parameters beyond the first four are
allowed, but are caught via an `...args:any[]` and thus are not type checked."

Background:

In ES6 we now have `Object.setPrototypeOf` which makes prototype delegation an alternative to *sugary*, fake class coding patterns. This can be accomplished in ES5, but ES6 is much more elegant. Here is a basic example. `new` is never used and `this` is very easy to follow.

Working example with changes to mithril.js on lines 854, 858, 859 *only*.

It's a common question on Gitter: How do I unmount a component?
Presently this Google Search: `unmount site:http://lhorie.github.io/`
returns one result: `mithril.route.html` -- I have no idea why, there's no ""unmount"" on the page.

Adding the words unmounting and unmount to this doc page will make them discoverable directly and through Google."

@ArthurClemens pointed out in this gitter comment:
https://gitter.im/lhorie/mithril.js?at=55664ba1d21e5ed02ff06e54
that the Classic MVC example is broken:
https://lhorie.github.io/mithril/components.html#classic-mvc

I wanted to show a working jsfiddle with these changes applied, but I couldn't figure out how to get a POST request working. I do, however, have a jsbin that is working, although there are significant changes in the code to allow for GET and POST.
http://jsbin.com/cokesu/2/edit?js,output

A redraw is called for every character entered in the jsbin but AFAICT, not in this PR. I don't know why. It's as though `oninput` is really `onchange`. It's possible to limit the redraw to once when the ""save"" button is clicked, but this requires a change in logic:

var ContactForm = {
    controller: function(args) {
        this.contact = m.prop(new Contact())
        this.save = function(contact) {
           Observable.trigger(""saveContact"", {contact: contact})
        }
    },
    view: function(ctrl, args) {
        var contact = ctrl.contact()

        return m(""form"", [
            m(""label"", ""Name""),
            m(""input[name=name]""),

            m(""label"", ""Email""),
            m(""input[name=email]""),

            m(""button[type=button]"", {onclick: function(){
              contact = {
                name: m.prop(this.parentNode.elements.name.value),
                email: m.prop(this.parentNode.elements.email.value)
              }
              ctrl.save(contact)
            
            }}, ""Save"")
        ])
    }

These changes make the the text clearer to me. I did not want to change the voice of the text, but I tried to clear out some verbosity and improve consistency. I did my best not to interfere with the logic of the prose.

This document seems written to stand on its own, so I recommend the following changes:

- a general explanation of the args param as in `controller: function(args) {` and `view: function(ctrl, args) { ...` (when first used, well before the signature)
- a specific explanation of {data: args} in m.request() (mithril.request.md could use the same treatment)
- an explanation of the extras param as in `controller: function(args, extras) {` and `view: function(ctrl, args, extras) { ...`
- the term *rollback* should be explained or replaced
- caveat #3/#4: Should *root element* be changed to *top-most element* so as not to be confused with the element the component is mounted on ?
- in testing, explain why the first param to view is `null`

I hope you can find some of this useful."

I added a simple check to see if this.attrs exists before calling in
.href. Fixed it like a charm. I tried to follow the current coding
style, but let me know if there is something amiss in my change.

I ran both grunt test and grunt testall and everything seemed to run
perfect."

I have noticed that one of the initial examples gives a error in my browser debugger (Safari). 
According to this page: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp, ""You should also avoid using the name of JavaScript built-in objects, properties, and method"" (and name is listed).
In my case, if I change name to something else, I no longer get the error.
