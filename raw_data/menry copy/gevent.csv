* Fix tests with TLS1.3

There were hidden assumptions about the order in which greenlets would run.

TLS1.3 changed the handshake in a way that broke those assumptions.

* Attempting to fix the appveyor backdoor test timeouts.

Suspect a buffering issue. Trying to fix by disabling Nagle's algorithm.

Also a cleaner separation of concerns in the backdoor server.

* Brute-force debugging.

* Tweak the backlog and simultaneous accept settings, and drop the extra event listeners we don't need.

* max_accept=1 and dropping the events fixed test__backdoor on windows.

probably it was just the events. test that.

* Brute force debugging for the SSL issues.

* Some of the windows ssl issues may be due to fileno reuse and hence incorrectly multiplexed watchers?

* Even more care with socket lifetimes.

On Python 3.7, use the newer wrapping form that the stdlib uses to create the _sslobj.

* More debugging.

* The preferred method of unwrapping differs on 3.6 and 3.7+

* Checking ordering.

* Partial success, hopefully.

* Lots of progress. Try again.

* More Windows work.

* D'oh. Test cases from 3.7.4 handle some of these issues more gracefully so we will just use them.

* Tweaks.

* Having a hard time getting 3.7 updated on Travis. Try to force the issue.

* Yet another weird error from appveyor."

This should eliminate cache thrashing when we upgrade python versions. And also eventually might do more caching here.

Also simplify the paths at which pythons are installed, so we only have to change one place to update a version.

The cache is only shared between stages that match things like environment variables.

Ah, we need CFFI at runtime; build isolation means pyproject.toml doesn't deliver it to us. We must have had it cached.

A DNSPython test we didn't run before sometimes fails. Must be multiple answers.

Tweak test coverage and test_ssl for PyPy3

Refactoring the testrunner; more needed, but this gets us simple travis folding.

Reorganize the test matrix for clarity, and shrink it back to what we used to test.

If those aren't available, use the old brute-force approach. This is
closer to what CPython does in its C implementation, and is much
faster.

We don't have to worry about the async signal safe stuff the C code
does because, guess what, we're running Python code here already
anyway, so much of it could wind up doing something that's not
actually safe anyway. Oh well.

Since we depend on Python 3.4 and above now, we can rely on the
CLOEXEC flag being set by default and not have to manually check
everything.

This speeds up 2.7 (close_fds defaults to *false* there, so the
default case doesn't change):

| Benchmark                 | 27_bench_subprocess | 27_bench_subprocess_dirfd     |
+---------------------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+
| spawn native no close_fds | 1.81 ms             | 1.79 ms: 1.01x faster (-1%)   |
| spawn gevent no close_fds | 2.11 ms             | 2.20 ms: 1.04x slower (+4%)   |
| spawn native close_fds    | 31.0 ms             | 30.2 ms: 1.03x faster (-3%)   |
| spawn gevent close_fds    | 31.6 ms             | 2.56 ms: 12.31x faster (-92%) |

And it really speeds up 3.7 (close_fds defaults to *true* there, so
the default case is much faster, and the non-default case is even better):

| Benchmark                 | 37_bench_subprocess | 37_bench_subprocess_dirfd     |
+---------------------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+
| spawn native no close_fds | 1.34 ms             | 1.27 ms: 1.06x faster (-6%)   |
| spawn gevent no close_fds | 117 ms              | 3.05 ms: 38.27x faster (-97%) |
| spawn native close_fds    | 1.36 ms             | 1.30 ms: 1.04x faster (-4%)   |
| spawn gevent close_fds    | 32.5 ms             | 3.34 ms: 9.75x faster (-90%)  |

In response to #1172

The following numbers are for my machine on macOS 10.13.3 with MAXFD
of 50000.

Python 2.7:

.....................
spawn native no close_fds: Mean +- std dev: 1.81 ms +- 0.04 ms
.....................
spawn gevent no close_fds: Mean +- std dev: 2.11 ms +- 0.08 ms
.....................
spawn native close_fds: Mean +- std dev: 31.0 ms +- 0.7 ms
.....................
spawn gevent close_fds: Mean +- std dev: 31.6 ms +- 0.6 ms

Notice that the times when close_fd=True (not the default on 2.7) are
about the same. 2.7 uses the same Python loop we do to close all the
fds.

Now 3.7:

.....................
spawn native no close_fds: Mean +- std dev: 1.34 ms +- 0.04 ms
.....................
spawn gevent no close_fds: Mean +- std dev: 117 ms +- 2 ms
.....................
spawn native close_fds: Mean +- std dev: 1.36 ms +- 0.03 ms
.....................
spawn gevent close_fds: Mean +- std dev: 32.5 ms +- 0.4 ms

Notice that gevent is *much* slower when we *don't* close the fds.
This is because, starting in Python 3.4, close_fds defaults to true,
and when it's false we have to check os.get_inheritable() for each fd
before we close it. gevent performs the same as it did on Python 2.7
when closing fds, but the native implementation is much faster due to
the C optimizations outlined in #1172---it turns out they apply to BSD
and Apple platforms in addition to Linux, although they're not async
safe.

Now, the C code does the opposite for inheritable handles: it
explicitly calls make_inheritable() for the ones it wants to keep and
lets the OS close the others with CLOEXEC. We could probably do that
too; the slow down for this case counts as a regression, I think."

The good news is that current master is about 10-15% faster for
sendall than 1.2.2 was (e.g., 301ws vs 256ms in Python 3.6). udp
sendto is roughly unaffected (within the margins, based on the native
performance). Moving the chunking implementation of sendall to Cython
doesn't show any improvements (so that's not a bottleneck, at least in
these benchmarks).

The ""bad"" news is that both UDP and (especially) sendall perform much
worse than native (native does about 47ms for sendall). This is
probably related to the fact that we're doing everything in one
process and one thread, and it is CPU bound; the native process can
use 150% CPU or so, but the gevent version cannot. So the comparison
is not directly meaningful.

As a performance optimization for applications where spawning
greenlets is critical. Plus some other optimizations to speed up
spawning in the general case.

CPython 3.6 with 1.2.2 vs these changes with tracking disabled:

| geventraw spawn kwarg  | 3.87 us            | 4.20 us: 1.08x slower (+8%)   |

The differences compared to master are hard to quantify because the
standard deviation ends up being more than 10% of the mean in many
cases---and about a 10% improvement is what we typically see, so it
goes back and forth."

The eventlet, sleep, join and raw tests serve as controls, so we can see
that there's up to ~10% variance between most runs anyway.

CPython 3.6 shows the least variance so those 10-20% improvement
numbers are probably fairly close.

PyPy sadly gets *slower* with this change for reasons that are utterly
unclear.

Compared to 1.3a1 (last benchmark) we're still up to 2-3x slower.

Creation of a raw greenlet shows 2.66us on CPython 3.6.4 vs the 3.65us
I reported in #755."

Do this with some cython tricks and some caching of type attributes.
Cython 0.28 compiles this code to be quite a bit faster than Cython
0.27 does (the below uses 0.28), but it's still a win on both.

The type caching could potentially be a compatibility issue, but in
practice I suspect it won't be.

Based on #755.

A comment in the code goes into detail about the timing. Here it is
again:

 Timings taken Feb 21 2018 prior to integration of #755
 python -m perf timeit -s 'import gevent' 'gevent.Greenlet()'
 3.6.4       : Mean +- std dev: 1.08 us +- 0.05 us
 2.7.14      : Mean +- std dev: 1.44 us +- 0.06 us
 PyPy2 5.10.0: Mean +- std dev: 2.14 ns +- 0.08 ns

 After the integration of spawning_stack, spawning_greenlet,
 and spawn_tree_locals on that same date:
 3.6.4       : Mean +- std dev: 8.92 us +- 0.36 us ->  8.2x
 2.7.14      : Mean +- std dev: 14.8 us +- 0.5 us  -> 10.2x
 PyPy2 5.10.0: Mean +- std dev: 3.24 us +- 0.17 us ->  1.5x

We're approximately the speed of eventlet now.

This should result in the loop getting serviced more often when there
are many callbacks to run. This is hooked up to `getswitchinterval` to
allow control.

We check the interval every 50 callbacks. That's hardcoded, which I
don't like, but the 1000 callback number was hardcoded before, so it's
not really much of a change. A future extension would be to calculate
the check number dynamically based on dividing the switch interval.

I don't have a specific test case for this change because I'm a little
fried, but all the other tests pass. I did manually verify that the
example in #1071 matches expectations---that could probably be turned
into a test case with some work.

cython ignores the preprocessor directives we previously had in
libev.pxd, so that was doing nothing, and it was treating vfd_socket_t
just as something it had to turn into an int.

The function it used to do this was the same function it used to turn
a generic PyObject into an int, once all the typedefs were substituted
in (which does use the c preprocessor from libev_vfd.h). So it should
be functionally equivalent.

The vfd_* functions are no-op macros on POSIX, so there shouldn't be a
performance difference. The minor exception is that __dealloc__ is
always defined, and although it's a static function suitable to
inline, there is an extra Python API call to PyErr_Fetch and
PyErr_Restore. But if that makes a difference, I didn't spot it."

CFFI (e.g., PyPy) and specifically it's needed for libuv; libev
doesn't really do much with it.

```

The main problem turned out to be the way in which libuv reports
signals at random times, much worse than the way libev does. This led
to callback functions unexpectedly returning 0, because that's the
default for an unhandled exception or an onerror handler that returns
None. That in turn led to calls to python_stop that we weren't
expecting using a handle that had already been deallocated.

The fix is to both be defensive about what handles we try to use, and
to be more explicit about our error returns."

It runs locally for me on Win10/Py3.6 with both libev and libuv.

It had been sometimes failing since 2016-02 for 2.7 and 2016-04 for
3.5.

Here's the comment in the code indicating what I tracked down. Note
that the changes are more of a workaround than a true fix:

XXX: On Windows (at least with libev), if we have a cleanup/tearDown
method that does 'del self.listener' AND we haven't sometime
previously closed the listener (while the test body was executing) we
tend to sometimes see hangs when tests run in succession; notably
test_empty_send followed by test_makefile produces a hang in
test_makefile when it tries to read from the client_file, because the
accept() call in accept_once has not yet returned a new socket to
write to.

The cause *seems* to be that the listener socket in both tests gets
the same fileno(); or, at least, if we don't del the listener object,
we get a different fileno, and that scenario works.

Perhaps our logic is wrong in libev_vfd in the way we use

Previously this was done when :mod:`gevent.threading` was imported.
That module is documented to be used as a helper for monkey patching,
so this should generally functionally be the same, but some
applications ignore the directly import that module anyway.

A positive consequence is that ``import gevent.threading, threading;
threading.current_thread()`` will no longer return a DummyThread
before monkey-patching. Another positive consequence is that PyPy will
no longer print a ``KeyError`` on exit if :mod:`gevent.threading` was

selectors test, and remove the devpoll selector under 3.5. also update
the monkey documentation."" Introduced a regression by moving the exec of
scripts into a main() function. If the script being run with exec has
import statements those are now locally scoped to the main() function
which can break the script.

It does not appear that this local scoping was intentional so the fix is
to exec the script in the global scope, returning the previous behavior.
This also requires setting __package__ = None otherwise the script
appears to be run in the gevent __package__"

* another blackballed test due to performance issues.

* missing revocation.crl for test_ssl.py

* Fix test_urllib2_localnet. We had to resort to a patch.

Sadly this exposes the fact that libuv doesn't allow multiple handles
for a given poll fd. Nor does it raise clear errors until you try to
close them in an order different from the inverse of the one they were
created in. Doing so simply aborts the process when libuv realises that
the watcher it has registered is not the watcher you're closing.

This further means that multiple watchers wont' get the right set of
events delivered, I think (though most of the tests were passing until I
discovered this crash)."

failing because threading._after_fork is getting called.

Now, threading._after_fork is *supposed to always be called*. This is
handled directly by os.fork(). But instrumentation shows that it doesn't
get called when we use the C library (and if we do call it, the test

Make it available to all Python versions, not just 3.5. It is
cooperative on all versions.

This requires some minor updates to the Popen API (being a context
manager and having the args attribute on Python 2) and works best when
the TimeoutExpired exception is also defined in Python 2 (as a subclass
of Timeout, for BWC).

This prompts me to wonder if some of the duplicated Py2/Py3
methods (like check_call) can be combined now. I think I'm generally OK
with API extensions so long as there are no BWC concerns, and the
context-management, in particular, is nice for those methods.

Actually it wasn't quite as dire as described there. Instead, there were
just extra copies of each chunk of data the application yielded.

This commit removes the copies, sending the data directly to the socket.
This should be most noticeable on larger chunks.

Also re-organize the call to close() the app iter closer to where the
app iter gets assigned, making it easier to spot. Add a test for
this---turns out the validator was closing the iterator for us!"

the base of gevent._ssl2.SSLSocket to be gevent._socket3.socket).

AsyncResult now behaves more like Event, meaning that:

The main stated reason for untraceable locks was a bug in Python 2.5,

duplicating the thread-safety inherent in Cython's compiled methods.

'pypy -m timeit -s ""import g.l.Semaphore; s=Semaphore()""' 's.acquire();s.releas()':

With Cython compiled semaphore: 5usec

Also clean up usage of hub._threadlocal, eliminating many try/except cases.

The particular crash seems to be in a corner-case usage (generally,
destroying a hub and/or loop seems to be advanced or rare usage), so I
feel pretty safe merging it into a release-track branch. The lifetime
management of the loop may not be totally ideal, but it solves the
issue. loop objects may now live longer (until the death of their
thread) if the hub was destroyed but the loop wasn't."

Also, this comes on the heels of adding back __weakref__ to Semaphore.
This becomes a field in the struct and the field is cleared in
tp_dealloc. It seems like this would trigger the memory leak bug when
taking references to a subclass, but testing seems to show that
doesn't happen. I guess PyPy handles that specially:

Resolves #477.

In Python 2.7.9, we have new SSL interfaces, that are not quite
the old Python 2 interfaces, nor the same as the Python 3 interfaces.

This creates a new SSL module, _sslgte279.py, for Python 2 versions
greater than or equal 2.7.9, ported from Python 2.7.9's ssl.py:
https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/648dcafa7e5f/Lib/ssl.py.

The process of porting was done by starting with gevent's ssl3.py and
backporting Python 2.7.9's ssl.py.

Fixes these tests under Python 2.7.9:

 - /usr/local/bin/python -u -m monkey_test --Event test_urllib2net.py
 - /usr/local/bin/python -u -m monkey_test test_urllib2net.py
 - /usr/local/bin/python -u test__ssl.py

No new test failures. Still failing since 72119c8:

 - /usr/local/bin/python -u -m monkey_test --Event test_ssl.py
 - /usr/local/bin/python -u -m monkey_test test_ssl.py

The `bufsize` option of the subprocess.Popen module wasn't used (at

subprocess.Popen module

Note that this change the default behavior of the class (buffered
becomes unbuffered in most cases)"

The stdlib tests are now included in the repository. since ubuntu
does not ships them in any package.

The testrunner is completely rewritten. When testrunner.py was originally written
a lot of tests were failing and some of them were hanging. Thus testrunner.py
was focused on proving good reports and could retry the tests with a particular
test case disabled if it detected time out. Now testrunner is somewhat simpler as
we mostly concerned whether the tests pass or not. It also runs the tests
concurrently, to improve the speed at which we get the results back from travis-ci.
Some tests time execution and assert certain timings, this can fail, especially when
the number of workers is bigger than cpu count. The new testrunner will re-try
tests that failed in a sequential run, when nothing else is run. If this fixes
the problem, the test is reported as ""succeeded, but only on the second try"" and does
reports the whole suite as failed.

.travis.yml is fixed to download binary packages for all dependencies and use system python.

rename test__benchmarks.py to xtest__benchmarks.py to exclude it form testrunner.py.

Exclude test__count from test_thread.py, because it uses function thread._count() we don't implement

For non-network requests, like ""localhost"", it seems to be quite hard
to make gevent.ares to do the right (=compatible with stdlib) thing.

So we check if host does not have '.' and if that's the case,
we fallback to using threadpool.

This covers requests like ""localhost"", ""ip6-localhost"" and Python-specific
things, like ""<broadcast>""

It's possible to disable this by passing use_threadpool=False to ResolverAres
or by settings resolver.pool = None."

- BaseServer now implements ""termporarily stop accepting"" strategy
- BaseServer now has _do_read method which does everything except for actually calling accept()/recvfrom()
- pre_start() method is renamed to init_socket()
- renamed _stopped_event to _stop_event
- 'started' is now a read-only property (which actually reports state of _stop_event)
- post_stop() method is removed
- close() now sets _stop_event(), thus setting 'started' to False, thus causing serve_forever() to exit

Avoid copying list of links by maintaining a 'dirty' flag that causes
_notify_links to restart iteration. This makes sure that we don't miss
a recently added link because notification is already in progress.

It is possible to notify the same links (that did not remove themselvers)
more than once, but it's better than not notifying some links at all.

rawlink() no longer schedules notification immediatelly if needed, because
there seem to be utility in such behaviour."

xcode is based on llvm-gcc, which btw is deprecated. The compilation
of libev bails out with:

We work around it by undefining __llvm__ which makes ev.c trust
gcc-llvm's advertised gcc version.

- getaddrinfo now handles integer ports of type string, e.g ""25"". Thanks to kconor.
- getaddrinfo now converts UnicodeEncodeError into error('Int or String expected')
- getaddrinfo now uses the lowest 16 bits of passed port integer, to mimic socketmodule.c
- getnameinfo calls getaddrinfo to process arguments, similar to socketmodule.c
- gethostbyaddr also uses getaddrinfo to process arguments

ares.pyx:

all watchers now behave like they did in 0.13: the incref themselves while in use by the event loop (that is, _ref versions are kept but without _ref in the name)

one reason for that is that doing ev_watcher_stop in watcher's __dealloc__ crashes: loop attribute is no longer a valid reference in __dealloc__; (although this could probably be worked around)

another reason is to make it simpler, having 2 sets of watchers is complex to explain.

third reason is: using watchers that automatically stopped themselves on __dealloc__ introduced a lot
of incompatibilities and potentially unexpected behaviour compared to gevent-0.13. it is also not recommended in general to depend on CPython's refcounting for resource management."

- core module gets a completely new interface, incompatible with gevent-0.13
- SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit are now re-raised in the main greenlet
- Python's signal module works

__init__.py:
  - add get_hub to __all__
  - remove shutdown()

get_hub() now accepts arguments to pass the loop (e.g. get_hub('select'))

Hub class:

  - new methods: handle_error, wait, cancel_wait, join
  - removed method: shutdown (replaced by join())

Timeout class:

  - allow passing string as exception

coros, event, greenlet:

  - use hub's handle_error to report_error rather than traceback module
  - save hub as an attribute rather than calling get_hub() all the time

With this change server.started always returns True after start() before stop() (or kill()).

Previously it could be False occassionally, because StreamServer could stop accepting for a while in presence of errors and StreamServer.started was defined as ""whether the server is currently accepting"".

Also, in StreamServer.kill remove link installed on pool's semaphore to avoid a GC cycle."

If the --libevent directory does not contain a .libs directory (that
is if make hasn't been run), setup.py will now run configure and make
in order to link statically against libevent.

It also contains some workarounds to correctly build on OS X:
  - it does build a ""fat"" gevent.core
  - it adapts linker flags and uses the statically linked libevent
    even if a dynamic one is on the search path"
