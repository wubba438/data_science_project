Previously only a space "" "" was considered a term separator when lexing

what was considered a token separator. This lead to issues where it was
not possible to search for some terms within an index. Specifically a
document containing a hyphenated token, e.g. ""foo-bar"" could not be
searched for as the query parser would convert this to two separate
terms ""foo"" and ""bar"" where as in the index this would be a single term
""foo-bar"".

This commit adds a property on the lunr.QueryLexer for the correct
separator to use, it currently points to lunr.tokenizer.separator so
that if a user changes the global separator for tokenising it will be
reflected when parsing queries. It may be required to make this more
configurable in the future, but for now this should suffice."

TokenSet#toString is used to identify candidates during minimisation.
Previously this was a recursive function that incorporated the finality
of a TokenSet, its edges and the toString of all its children.

This lead to a bug where TokenSets were minimised incorrectly, leading
to extraneous entries in the TokenSet. When these were looked up in the
inverted index, there was no corresponding entry, leading to no method
errors.

By giving each token set an auto incrementing id we can be sure when we
are referring to the same TokenSet during minimsation.

The token set object contains an object `edges` that is being used as a
hash. This prevents V8 from optimising the function [1]. Knowing that
the `edges` object is always 'hash like' we get all its keys using
Object.keys and iterate this list using a regular for loop.

Some quick benchmarks showed a small increase in performance from this,
but the function is now being optimised, which means that we should be
able to get 'free' performance improvements from V8, and possibly other
JavaScript engines, in the future.

Sadly this mispelling was in the public API for customising the

keeping the misspelt property, but preferring the correctly spelt
separator property.

Integrations that make use of the old property will still work, but this
property is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major version
release. Customising the tokenizer should be done by setting the new
property - lunr.tokenizer.separator.

On the plus side maybe this will help me remember to spell separator
correctly from now on!"

Before this change the tokenizer was a global property of lunr, every
index would use the same tokenizer. It was possible to change the
tokenizer but not on a per index basis.

This change gives each instance of lunr.Index its own tokenzier,
defaulting to the existing lunr.tokenizer implementation. Each index can
change the tokenizer it uses without affecting any other index instance.

de-serialised custom tokenizers can be regsitered in much the same way
as a custom text processing function is registered in lunr.Pipeline."

The pipeline should ensure that the index gets clean data to work with,
in this case clean data means that no token should be empty. The
pipeline already included logic to filter out tokens that are undefined.
The pipeline function lunr.trimmer contained logic to exclude empty
strings.

The implementation of trimmer is not generic enough to be used with all
languages, specifically non latin character languages are not well
handled by the current implementation, and therefore in some cases users
choose to omit the trimmer from their pipeline. This can lead to issues
where empty tokens are introduced into the index.

This change moves the logic for filtering out empty tokens from the
trimmer to the pipeline itself, in the same way that the pipeline
removes undefined tokens, it now also removes empty tokens. With this
change the pipeline will guarantee that the index sees clean data,
regardless of whether the trimmer is part of the pipeline, it also
allows the trimmer function to be more focused on just trimming
whitespace."
