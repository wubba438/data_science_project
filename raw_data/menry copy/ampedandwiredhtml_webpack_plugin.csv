Since it creates too much email notification noise, and the reason
for locking should be clear enough on its own (its performed by a
username of `lockbot` and the status of the issue/PR is set to

I decided against adding a label, since it will only end up adding
noise to the labels list and issue/PR search results that adds little
value other than as a workaround for inability to set a custom GitHub
lock reason.

Previously minification was disabled by default. Now, if `minify`
is `undefined` and `mode` is `'production'`, then it is enabled using
the following options:

```
{
  collapseWhitespace: true,
  removeComments: true,
  removeRedundantAttributes: true,
  removeScriptTypeAttributes: true,
  removeStyleLinkTypeAttributes: true,
  useShortDoctype: true
}
```

These options were based on the settings used by create-react-app,
Neutrino and vue-cli, and are hopefully fairly conservative. See:
https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/1036#issuecomment-421408841
https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier#options-quick-reference

These same defaults can enabled regardless of `mode`, by setting
`minify` to `true` (which previously passed an empty object to
html-minifier, meaning most minification features were disabled).
Similarly, minification can be disabled even in production, by setting
`minify` to `false`.

This change has no effect on users who pass an object to `minify`.

Fixes #1036."

webpack-dev-server@2.0.0-beta seems to be emitting hot update bundles separately from the full bundle. This makes HtmlWebpackPlugin mistake it for the real bundle, and generates a HTML file that looks like this:

```html
<script src=""0.8f9c33574d86dd9eab0d.hot-update.js""></scriptt>
```

This commit uses quite a hack to check if the emitted bundle is a hot-update bundle, and skip emitting `index.html` file."

As far as I know, getting the file size within the template is not possible.

                x.setRequestHeader('Content-type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
                x.onreadystatechange = function() {
                    x.readyState > 3 && callback && callback(x.responseText, x);
                };
                x.addEventListener(""progress"", onProgress, false);
                x.send(data)
            } catch (e) {
                window.console && console.log(e);
            }
        };

        function onLoad(responseText) {
            var script = document.createElement('script');
            script.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');
            if (script.text) {
                script.text = content; // IE
            } else {
                script.appendChild(document.createTextNode(responseText));
            }
            document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);
            document.getElementById('appLoader').className = 'finished';
        }

        function onProgress(e) {
            var progress = Math.floor((e.loaded / {%=o.htmlWebpackPlugin.files.chunks.main.size %} || 0) * 100);
            document.getElementById('appLoader').setAttribute(""value"", progress);
            document.getElementById('appLoaderPercent').innerText = document.createTextNode(progress).textContent;
