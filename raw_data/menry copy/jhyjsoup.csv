Introduced the ability to chose between HTML and XML output, and made
HTML the default. This means img tags are
output as <img>, not <img />. XML is the default when using the
XmlTreeBuilder. Control this with the
Document.OutputSettings.syntax() method.

Tightened the scope of what characters are escaped in attributes and
textnodes, to align with the spec. Also, when
using the extended escape entities map, only escape a character if the
current output charset does not support it.
This produces smaller, more legible HTML, with greated control over the
output (by setting charset and escape mode).

The FormElement extends Element to provide ready access to a form's
controls, and to allow the form to be submitted. It also connects forms

the form element be a parent of the control, like when the form tag is
in a TR but the control in a TD. In that case the form tag gets
reparented."

The former method is a little faster, and creates less garbage. However when the input is large,
and apps retain data pulled from the DOM, the app may perceive a memory leak, as even a small string
is actually as large as the original input (although multiple strings are all backed by the one
original input).

So, this implementation is a little less performant, but has a potential for greater safety,
depending on how the library is used."
