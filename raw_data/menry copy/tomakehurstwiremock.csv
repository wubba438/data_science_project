The RAML spec has been superseded by OpenAPI 3.0. While we could

it's unlikely anyone is relying on the RAML spec since it's of limited
usefulness, and maintaining both specs would be time-consuming."

This adds an OpenAPI 3.0 spec and uses it to generate the swagger.json
file, instead of converting the RAML spec to Swagger 2.0 with
`api-spec-converter`. OpenAPI is more flexible and solves conversion
issues involving the `$ref` elements.  This new spec is much more
complete than the RAML spec, which will be removed entirely in a
subsequent commit."

This updates Swagger UI to the latest version, since the current
version doesn't support OpenAPI 3.0. Although I could've extracted the
new version in place, I figured it'd be better to handle it in
package.json by adding `swagger-ui-dist` as a dependency and copying it
over the necessary files during build time. This will make upgrades
easier in the future."

This makes a couple minor backwards-compatible fixes for OpenAPI 3.0
compatibility:
1. Remove the ""id"" properties in scenario.schema.json, which aren't
present in any of the other schema files, and cause validation errors.
2. Define the baseUri to be ""/__admin"". Besides simplifying all the
other URLs, this gets translated to the server object URL by
api-spec-converter, which is required in OpenAPI 3.0:

common parameters, and adds separate schemas that extend it with the
endpoint-specific parameters."

This fixes a few mistakes in the docs and API specs:
1. The recording API takes a 'persist' parameter, not 'persistent'
2. The stub-mapping.schema.json spec used 'descrption' instead of 'description'
3. The scenario.schema.json spec used 'examples' instead of 'example'.
While 'examples' is valid JSON Schema, everything else uses 'example',
and this is what api-spec-converter looks for."

Sometimes, when writing a StubMappingTransformer extension, you want to
change a single field in the RequestPattern (e.g. the URL). This is
difficult because RequestPattern is immutable and RequestPatternBuilder
can't build off an existing object the way ResponseDefinitionBuilder
can.

This adds two new methods to RequestPatternBuilder, like() and but(),
that do the same thing as the corresponding methods in
ResponseDefinitionBuilder."

The ""JsonFileMappingsSource.loadingMappingsInfo()"" method looks for JSON
files in the mappings directory recursively, which is useful since it
allows organizing stubs in a directory hierachy. However, the ""remove()""

because the path components are stripped out of the filename.

This was introduced in 7f93b5eb996722c1919a6e1e627d550f7929ac39, which
changed the ""getFileName()"" to strip out all path compontents. I updated
that method to only do so for non-file URLs."

While working on the snapshot feature, I discovered that binary response
bodies were getting corrupted. This is happening because the
LoggedResponse.from() method sets the body by calling
Response.getBodyAsString(), which encodes the body in the charset for
the content type header (or UTF-8, if that's absent). Any invalid
characters in the string get silently replaced with the default
replacement character (U+FFFD for Unicode).

I fixed this by just copying what LoggedRequest is doing: instantiate
the body using a Base64-encoded string and have a ""getBodyAsString()""
method that does necessary encoding.

I moved the Response.encodingFromContentTypeHeaderOrUtf8() method to
ContentTypeHeader.encodingOrUtf8() so both Response and LoggedResponse
could use it."

This adds a new API endpoint, ""/__admin/snapshot"", for recording stub
mappings from the request journal. It's an alternative to the
""Record & Playback"" feature that does not require restarting the
server, and has additional customization options.

The ""/__admin/snapshot"" endpoint accepts POST requests with the
following options as a JSON object:

* ""filters"" - Request patterns to use for determining which requests
  for which to create stub mappings.
  * Possible values: Identical to ""/__admin/requests/find"". See the
  Request Matching docs for details.
  * Default: no filtering.

* ""persist"" - If set to true, persist stub mappings to disk. Otherwise,
  just output stub mappings.
  * Possible values: true, false
  * Default: true

* ""sortFields"" - Array of fields in the request to use for sorting stub
  mappings, mainly for output.
  * Possible values: ""url"", ""method"", or a header name (e.g. ""Accept"")
  * Default: no sorting.

* ""captureHeaders"" - Header matchers for including headers in the
  stub mapping. The request is matched against each matcher, and the
  associated header is added to the stub mapping if there's a match.
  * Possible values: Request matchers for headers.
  * Default: none

* ""outputFormat"" - Determines response body.
  * Possible values: ""ids"" to return array of stub mapping IDs, ""full""
  to return array of stub mapping objects
  * Default: ""ids"""

This expands on the existing fixed delay functionality by providing a
more general feature to draw values from a random distribution.

This allows teams to simulate long tails in delays from downstream
systems, a common scenario in load and resiliency tests.

I've provided a log normal implementation out of the box, which gives a
pretty good long tail distribution for modeling delays. It also has the
nice benefit of being able to specify the 50th percentile which is a
commonly tracked metric.

Here is an example priming using the log normal delay:

{
    ""request"": {
            ""method"": ""GET"",
            ""url"": ""/some/thing""
    },
    ""response"": {
            ""status"": 200,
            ""body"": ""Hello world!"",
            ""headers"": {
                    ""Content-Type"": ""text/plain""
            },
            ""delayDistribution"": {
                    ""type"": ""lognormal"",
                    ""median"": 80,
                    ""sigma"": 0.4
            }

    }
}

This example can be viewed visually at wolfram alpha:
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=lognormaldistribution%28log%2890%29%2C+0.4%29

New distributions can be added by implementing `DelayDistribution` and
adding it to the @JsonTypeInfo in the interface."

My apps have very large Headers which were overflowing Jetty's
Request Header Buffer, this resulted in response: 413 FULL head

This patch adds the ability to specify a Jetty Header Buffer
Size as a CLI flag when starting standalone Wiremock.

To recreate the problem do any GET with a single header larger
than 9k or so.  I added an acceptance test that demonstrates the
problem.

Also added console output confirmation when Jetty related command
line flags are specified (there are 3 now total). They previously
weren't output even when applied which leads to confusion."
