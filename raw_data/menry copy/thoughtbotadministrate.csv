If we add:

    COLLECTION_FILTERS = {
      inactive: ->(resources) { resources.where(""login_at < ?"", 1.week.ago) }
    }

to a dashboard, we can query the resources of that dashboard with

    bob inactive:

to find users named ""bob"" who hasn't logged in the last week.

If you already had the `inactive` scope you could define the filter like so to
take advantage of existing ActiveRecord scopes (and other class methods on the
resource class).

    COLLECTION_FILTERS = {
      inactive: ->(resources) { resources.inactive }
    }

While the chosen hash-based syntax is a bit more verbose than simply exposing
already defined scopes like so:

    # app/dashboards/customer_dashboard.rb
    COLLECTION_FILTERS = [:inactive]

it allows us to define filters for use in Administrate without having to clutter
the resource classes with scopes.

It still allows us to add the simpler syntax in a backwards compatible way at
some point down the line if we feel the need. For example it could end up
looking like:

    COLLECTION_FILTERS = {
      vip: :vip, # This could call the method `vip` on resources
      inactive: ->(resources) { resources.where(""login_at < ?"", 1.week.ago) }
    }

* Allow search_spec to be run on its own,
* Introduce the concept of a search query
  - adding collection scopes/filters means we need to add more involved
    search query parsing; this gives us a place for that,"

rspec-rails 4.0 is not compatible with older versions of rails.

I also removed the pessimistic version constraints for the Rails

upgrade, and it is something Rails itself is moving away from."

After merging https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/pull/945, a problem surfaced with plugins that provide new types of association fields, such as https://github.com/pablobm/administrate-field-nested_has_many.

`Administrate::BaseDashboard` hard-codes the possible types of association fields in a list that is later used to determined the permitted params. This means that new types of fields cannot make permitted params and things break.

My proposed solution (see `lib/administrate/base_dashboard.rb`) does a programmatic search for field classes that inherit from `Administrate::Field::Associative`. This allows plugin authors not to worry about adding their new type to a list or any other sort of setup.

A potential problem with this approach is that it includes `Administrate::Field::Polymorphic` on the list. I don't know if this can cause problems down the line or not."

Fixes #1105. As described in #1105, there are some inconsistencies in
the way Administrate handles labels for `HasMany`/`BelongsTo`/`HasOne`
associations.

* `HasMany` (eg: `Order#line_items`)
  - Gives ""line_items"" as the label
  - No i18n.

* `BelongsTo` (eg:  `Customer#country`)
  - Defaults to ""Country code"" (similar to ""Country id"" in this case).
  - Allows i18n as `helpers.label.customer.country_code`.

* `HasOne` (eg:  `Product#product_meta_tag`)
  - Gives ""Product Meta Tag"".
  - No i18n.

The behavior of the `BelongsTo` field is most correct, and is preserved
in this commit.

The behavior of `HasMany` and `HasOne` has been improved as follows:

* `HasMany` (eg: `Order#line_items`) now no longer overrides the text
  given to the `label` helper, and passes the attribute name. This results
  in a default label of ""Line items"" and one that can be overridden with
  i18n with a key at the standard location (`helpers.label.order.line_items`)
* `HasOne` (eg:  `Product#product_meta_tag`) now can be overriden with
  the key `helpers.label.order.line_items`.

The `HasOne` is rendered into a nested form, inside of a fieldset and
with a legend. The text of the ""label"" in this nested form is actually
in a legend tag. I considered the fact that this was not using the
`label` helper, whether it should be switch to a label from a legend, or
whether we should have a non-standard i18n key. In the end, I decided
that the least surprising behavior would be to customize the ""label"" for
that attribute at the expected label's i18n key."

A recent issue (#1010) highlighted a deprecation under certain Ruby
versions that we should be aware of. So far, we've been using CircleCI
for running tests and previously they didn't support multiple builds.

With Circle CI 2.0, Workflows allows for something like this to be setup. This
uses YAML inheritance to share a job definition across multiple build
types (defined as different Docker configurations).

This introduces Ruby 2.3 and 2.4.3 in addition to 2.5.0 and using Postgres 9.5.

Notable caveat to this approach is that you must set different databases
for each environment (here named like the Ruby versions) to avoid test
state-based errors."

This adds support for editing polymorphic fields. Props go to @pedantic-git, on whose work this is based. This PR supersedes https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/pull/984.

An important aspect of this PR is how it handles the polymorphic value. At heart, polymorphic values are split in two: an id and a type. Using [the `globalid` gem](https://github.com/rails/globalid) we can obtain a string that represents both. However, we still need to tell that this string is indeed a globalid and not a literal value when we get to `Administrate::ApplicationController#resource_params`. I handle this by splitting the field in two:

  * `my_field[value]`: the global id, which includes both type and instance id.
  * `my_field[type]`: literally `""Administrate::Field::Polymorphic""`

Then `#resource_params` can look at the param values and treat them appropriately. If it's a simple value such a string, it does nothing special. However, if it comes in this value/type form, we treat it as polymorphic, reading the global id."

`aria-labelledby` accepts `id`s of other elements which act as an
accessible label(s). It's great for providing a label to tables, which
are large amounts of content; it helps people understand what the table
content actually is.

We're currently using `aria-labelledby` on tables in Administrate,
pointing to the `id` of the `h1` on index pages. However, this breaks
when tables are shown as attribute data on show pages, because the `id`
of `page-title` does not exist, and it also is not the proper label for
the table (the attribute name is). You can see an example of this here:
https://administrate-prototype.herokuapp.com/admin/customers/9849

This PR allows an `id` of an element to be passed into the partial
which displays the collection table, so that it can used as the value
for the table's `aria-labelledby` attribute."

Problem: When default scopes with joins are used, the generated

impossible to decide which table to use.

Solution: Add `resource_class`'s `table_name` to the generated search

`table_name.id` instead of `id` in the where clause generated for the

The sidebar uses the resource for both the *name* of the link, and the
inferred path that we're linking to. The problem with this comes when
the resource/model/dashboard is namespaced. It will break when it runs
into something that ends up looking like:

```
link_to ""logged customer"", [:admin, ""logged/customer""]
```

... which will break. Instead, it should turn out to look something like:

```
link_to ""logged customer"", [:admin, ""logged_customer""]

This commit fixes this by updating the resources being looped through
from strings (for the name), to an object exposing both a name and a
path, (and corresponding strings and symbols)."

If a name-spaced model and corresponding dashboard exists we will run
into a problem. When we do something like link to a resource's `new`
page, we currently use `page.resource_name` to infer what the path to
that page should be. This probably works 90+ percent of the time because
most models are not name-spaced. That is until you get into apps that
either mount engines containing their own models (and are appropriately
name-spaced), or larger apps that namespace conceptually related
resources.

For purposes of this example, and the most recent issue that I've run
into, I have a `Logged` namespace for both a model and a dashboard.
Let's say we have a ""Logged::Order"" model/dashboard. What happens?

```
link_to(""New Logged Order"", [:new, namespace, page.resource_name])
=> 'admin_logged/order_path'
```

That path won't fly. Instead, we want to see `'admin_logged_order_path'`.

As a result, I've added a `resource_path` method to the base page class
that will handle this responsibility, and backed the original and new
method with some tests to make sure they are behaving as expected.

using glob imports with sass-rails you simply see an application error:

error, which provides helpful messaging (""Invalid CSS after…""), and

Let's say an `Author` has_many `Book`s.

`Field::HasMany` loads each Book record and calls `display_resource` on each
one. If the `Book` dashboard defines `display_resource` to call
`book.author.name`, N `Author` records will be loaded, one for each book.

This can significantly slow down load time.

To fix this, Administrate users can now tell Administrate to preload associated
records using Rails' `includes` option. Example usage:

Problem:

When developing a plugin for Administrate,
there is not a good way to define custom javascripts or stylesheets
to be included on admin pages.

Existing solutions either use `content_for` at the field level,
or require the end user to override Administrate's javascript partial.

Solution:

Add methods to `Administrate::Engine` to keep track of the assets
that need to be loaded on each admin page.

Plugin developers can now use these helpers in their engine definition:

```ruby
Administrate::Engine.add_javascript ""my_plugin/script""
Administrate::Engine.add_stylesheet ""my_plugin/styles""
```"

Problem:

This repository contains both the administrate gem

The demo application uses the image field,
which means that its Gemfile will be dependent on the new

In turn, the administrate-field-image gem
is dependent on the administrate gem in this repository.
This creates a little bit of a chicken-and-egg problem
for publishing both of those gems.

Solution:

Our release plan is as follows:

- Release this branch as a new version of the administrate gem,
  as version `0.2.0.rc1`
- Make administrate-field-image dependent on
  `""administrate"", ""0.2.0.rc1"", ""~> 0.2.0""`
- Release administrate-field-image v `0.0.1`
- Make the demo app's Gemfile dependent on
  `""administrate-field-image"", ""~> 0.0""`
- Re-push this branch to Github to run CircleCI suite. All of the gems
  would be available on rubygems.org, so the suite should pass.

Fixes #310

Problem:

Rails provides a way to undo the effects of generators,
by running the command `rails destroy GENERATOR_NAME`.

With the way that we had set up our hierarchy of generators,
Rails did not know how to undo the effects of sub-generators.

For example, with the `administrate:views` generator,
we were calling `Rails::Generators.invoke(""administrate:views:index"")`.

Whether the generator was run with the `generate` or `destroy` command
did not make a difference -
the index generator would always be invoked
as if it were run with `generate`.

Solution:

Rails generators use the `@behavior` instance variable to keep track of
how the generator was run.
This variable can be either `:invoke` or `:revoke`.

Pass this variable as an option to the sub-generators
to ensure they have the same behavior as the parent.

Minor changes:

Extract `Administrate::GeneratorHelpers` to store common
generator-related methods."

`inline_svg` gem is currently broken to work with Sprockets 3 and the
Rails application environment set to production.
So this has broken `administrate` as well.
Normally, a fix should be implemented in broken gem but after looking at
why `administrate` requires `inline_svg` gem I realize that it is easy
to replace it with a helper method.

`ApplicationHelper#svg_tag` method was added to substitute the work of
`inline_svg`. This method creates a svg tag that will look like:

    <svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""
    xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><use
    xlink:href=""http://localhost:3000/assets/administrate/search-360c782d91a21edd53f5754c3fd8f8984ec5d9b36389f6df1fe618a4e50405b6.svg#search"" width=""16"" height=""16""></use></svg>

This will allow to resize the svg image and to use css to change
properties like color.

But there are a couple of differences with `inline_svg`.
First the svg file should have an id property,
for my previous example it is `search`.

The second difference is that `use` tag needs to have
`height` and `width` properties set as attributes of the tag, css
properties will not affect the svg size.

`ApplicationHelper#svg_tag` used to generate html above looks like:

  <%= svg_tag ""administrate/search.svg"",
    svg_id: ""search"", width: ""16"", height: ""16"" %>

This solution will play nice with Sprockets and with modern browsers."

Closes #202

Problem:

The documentation states that views will be generated
in the `app/views/administrate/` directory,
but they are actually generated in `app/views/admin/`.

Solution:

In fact, both paths work correctly for overriding views.

Rails looks up views based on the inheritance tree of your controllers.
In this case, our inheritance tree looks like:

```
Administrate::ApplicationController
Admin::ApplicationController
Admin::CustomersController # base level
```

... so Rails will look for views in:

`app/views/admin/customers`,
THEN `app/views/admin/application`,
THEN `app/views/administrate/application`.

In the future,
we'd like to support multiple admin dashboards in the same application,
by nesting them under different namespaces
(e.g. `app/views/admin` and `app/views/super_admin`).
In that case, views under `app/views/administrate`
would apply to *all* of the admin dashboards.
Views under `app/views/admin` would only apply
to the dashboard at the `/admin` route,
and wouldn't affect the dashboard at `/super_admin`.

Because of this, we'd prefer to keep the generated views in `/admin`.
We'll keep the current implementation, and update the documentation."

Problem:

Administrate requires that its dashboards be mounted at `/admin`.

In applications with an `Admin` model,
Administrate will cause an error
because it will try to define `Admin` as a module
when it's already been defined as a class.

The hard-coded namespace limits users' freedom
in defining their own URL schema,
and prevents users from mounting
multiple Administrate dashboards at once.

Solution:

Dynamically evaluate Administrate's namespace from the request's URL.
This dynamically calculated value is used for all links and redirects
in Administrate dashboards.

The namespace is now only set by generators.
If a user wants to change their namespace
away from the default of `admin`,
they must run the generators and manually change `admin`
to the namespace of their choice.

Next Steps:

Change generators to accept
(or read from some configuration file)
an optional namespace argument
instead of always using the `admin` namespace."

Solution:

When generating a dashboard class for an ActiveRecord model,
inspect the class to see if it has defined enums

If the column in question is an Enum,
by default interpret it as a String field that is not searchable.

As a follow-up task, we can define a custom field

Problem:

When the title of the page is unusually long,
it can wrap onto multiple lines.
Because the action button is aligned to the bottom of the header,
the action button is then shifted downwards.
This creates an awkward whitespace on the page,
and ruins the alignment.

Solution:

Align the button and header by their baseline,
so the button stays in the same place regardless of whether the header
wraps lines.

Also, add a margin to the left of the header action buttons,
so they can keep a bit of distance from the page header
even when the header is unusually long."

They ran `bundle update nokogiri`

Problem:

Developers are unable to display their ActiveRecord classes in the UI
by any other name than the titleized class name.

For example,
if a team is building an admin dashboard that will be used in Russian,
they may have ActiveRecord models with English names, that need to be
translated before they're displayed in the UI.

Solution:

Rails has support for [translating ActiveRecord Models][1],
which relies on defining I18n translations
under the `activerecord.models` namespace.

Rails expects translations in the form:

```yaml
en:
  activerecord:
    models:
      user:
        one: Customer
        other: Customers
```

The separate `one` and `other` keys allow Rails to display
the correct plural or singular form of the word,
depending on the context.

We've used Rails' built-in `Foo.model_name.human` method
to correctly pull the translations out of I18n,
with sane fallbacks if the translation is not defined.

Fixes #145 and #219

Problem:

When the install generator tries to populate the `DashboardManifest`
with all of the `ActiveRecord` models,
it trips up on unnamed models,
and generates a manifest with invalid syntax.

Offending unnamed subclasses show up like this:

```ruby
> ActiveRecord::Base.descendants.last
 #<Class:0x007fddea1bdf08> (call '#<Class:0x007fddea1bdf08>.connection' to establish a connection)
```

When users have one of these unnamed subclasses in their application,
they receive a `NameError`
when they run the `administrate:install` generator:

```
/gems/administrate-0.1.0/lib/generators/administrate/dashboard/dashboard_generator.rb:87:
in `const_get': wrong constant name #<class:0x007fcf52bfe248> (NameError)
```

Explanation:

This bug has shown up in a few users' applications
when they are using the `spring` gem
and have `has_and_belongs_to_many` relationships defined.
The problem is two-fold:

1. There's a quirk in Rails,
  where if you define the same `has_and_belongs_to_many` relationship
  multiple times,
  Rails generates an unnamed subclass of `ActiveRecord::Base`.
2. There's a bug in Spring,
  where the generated classes for `HABTM` relationships
  don't get cleaned up correctly.
  When Spring reloads the HABTM relationship,
  it has the same effect as defining the relationship a second time.

Solution:

- In the install generator, ignore any models that are not constants.
  We determine constants by checking that the model's `#name`
  matches its `#to_s`.
- Print a warning for the ignored models."

Problem:

Administrate relies on `#to_s`

In order to get Administrate working correctly,
developers must define `#to_s` on all models

This process is not documented,
can be confusing,
and gets in the way of a zero-configuration dashboard.

Solution:

Add `Administrate::BaseDashboard#display_resource`,
which takes a resource and returns a sensible string representation.
Devs can overwrite this method on a per-dashboard basis
to customize how their resources are displayed.

Add generated comment for `display_resource`, that looks like:

```
  # Overwrite this method to customize how line items are displayed
  # across all pages of the admin dashboard.
  #
  # def display_resource(line_item)
  #   ""LineItem ##{line_item.id}""

Problem:

When a user edits a resource
with a `Date`, `Time`, or `DateTime` attribute,
and the attribute already has a value,
the date-time picker clears out the value.

Unless the user re-fills the field,
the value will be reset and will cause an error
when they hit ""submit"".

Solution:

Update the `datetimepicker` date format
to match the Rails default.

This solution introduced a secondary problem:

With the datetimepicker format change,
tests fail intermittently in `spec/features/orders_form_spec.rb`.

It looks like somehow, DatabaseCleaner is running early
after the `update` action redirects or renders a new view.
It is difficult to track down the exact failure, however.

Solution:

Switch to poltergeist as a js test runner.
Not sure why this stops the tests from failing, but it does."

Problem:

Administrate assumes that all subclasses of `ActiveRecord::Base` are

the installation generator sees an error:

Problem:
--------

With the git subtree strategy adopted in #144,
there are several unconventional things
surrounding the heroku deploy process:

- Pushing to heroku requires a `git subtree` command
- We need special logic in the Gemfile in order to run the demo app
  locally with our local version of Administrate.
- `rake` and `rails` commands need to be run from the
  `spec/example_app` subdirectory.

In addition, there is a dependency problem between the example app
and the master branch of administrate on github.
The example app needs to pull the master branch
as a dependency on heroku,
but the `Gemfile.lock` locks it in to a specific version.

It is impossible to point the `Gemfile.lock`
at the repo's current commit,
because that would require a new commit
before we could deploy to Heroku.

The result would be that the branch on Heroku would always differ
from the branch on GitHub by at least one commit,
and we would need to develop special tooling around pushing to heroku.

Solution:
---------

Make the `rails`, `rake`, and `bundle exec` commands work
from the root directory of the repository.
This involved:

- Move the `config.ru` script to the root of the repo
- Update `rake` and `rails` binstubs to reference nested rails app
- Move `unicorn.rb` (required by Procfile) to top-level `config` dir
- Combine both Gemfiles into a single one, at the root of the repo
- Remove spring for simplicity
- Remove unused rake tasks

I tested the following tasks.
All work from the root directory of the repo:

- deploy to heroku: `git push heroku master`
- run server locally: `rails server` or `foreman start`
- seed demo database: `rake db:seed`
- migrate demo database: `rake db:migrate`
- reset demo database: `rake db:drop db:create`
- run rails generators:
  - `rails generate administrate:field FooBar`
  - I was pleasantly surprised that this placed the files
    in the correct `spec/example_app` subdirectory
- access demo app console:: `rails console`
- view demo app routes: `rake routes`
- appraisal test suite: `bundle exec appraisal rake`

Problem:

Because `administrate.gemspec` was not at the root of the repository,
users could not install the gem by pointing their Gemfile at Github.

Solution:

Move the gem to the root directory and moves the example app to a
directory within the `/spec` directory. This makes it possible to refer
to the gem directly from git or Github.

The example app is stored as a [git subtree], which means it can be
deployed separately to Heroku or other hosting services.

[git subtree]: https://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/05/alternatives-to-git-submodule-git-subtree/

Change notes:

- The `translate` method defined in the controller was causing i18n-tasks
to get confused about the missing keys in the locale file. Renamed it to
`translate_with_resource`.

- Fix Capybara Webkit deprecation warning
- Load schema before running specs
- Update the example apps Gemfile to point at Github, so the example app
  can be deployed to Heroku. For local development, the local copy of
  `administrate` takes precedence over the example app's Gemfile, and
  tests still run as expected.
- Add rake task to deploy example app. This uses
  more-complex-than-normal git subtree commands, so it's good to have a
  shortcut."

Inspiration: http://thepugautomatic.com/2013/05/locals/

Problem:

It is idiomatic in Rails
to use instance variables
to pass data from controllers to views.

However, there are a number of disadvantages to this approach:

- If you mistype an instance variable in a view,
  the application quietly swallows the error
  and returns `nil`.
- Instance variables can be set from anywhere in a controller,
  which can lead to spaghetti code
  and confusion about which variables
  are available for use in the view.

Solution:

By passing local variables explicitly to views,
we can be more confident about the API
between controllers and views."

Problem:

A common use case for admin dashboards is sorting by a column,
and it feels restrictive to not have access to controls

Solution:

- Add column-based ordering

Users can click on a column heading to order by that column,
and they can click a second time to reverse the order.

The column that is currently being ordered by
displays an arrow representing the direction the data is ordered in.

Sorting does not interfere with the user's current search

Most of the ordering logic lives in `Administrate::Order`,
including knowledge of the currently ordered attribute
and the HTTP parameters for each sorting link.

If a user tries to order by any column that doesn't exist on the model,
it will quietly ignore the request and not sort the data at all."

This reverts commit 267edf27a79e85ac226c0f281e33eeee2eef5715.

There are two ways to handle the controller layer for Administrate:

1. Generate a single controller, `Admin::ApplicationController`, and
  route the RESTful actions for all resource types through it.
  Let users subclass the controller
  to create resource-specific behavior.
2. Generate `Admin::ApplicationController`, which contains all of the
  default `RESTful` logic, as well as empty subclasses for each resource
  type. If users want to customize controller actions in the future,
  this saves them a generator step.

We originally went with option 2,
before switching to option 1 in 267edf2.

That switch came in the wake of adding Administrate to Hound.
We decided to change to a single controller to reduce the diff noise
from the administrate:install generator.

Recently, we've started adding Administrate to Upcase.
Upcase is a more complex application,
and needs more customization off the bat.
After attempting several customizations,
it's clear that it would be much cleaner/easier to customize
if the relevant controller subclasses had been pre-generated.

Some examples of customizations we've needed to make are:

- defining custom resource finders (e.g. to look up a product by a slug)
- overriding a view for a single resource type (Rails needs the subclass
  chain to look up the correct view to render)

This change also makes routing significantly cleaner,
letting us use the `resources` method without additional arguments.

Many of these problems could be solved by taking option 1,
and writing very good documentation & controller/view generators,
but as an MVP I believe it's cleaner and clearer for developers to
explicitly define the controller subclasses up front.

- Document `find_resource`

Until now, polymorphic relationships were being treated as standard
belongs_to relationships. When Administrate inferred the incorrect class
name for models, it resulted in a 500 error. This was most commonly seen
on the form page.

In addition, when a polymorphic relationship has a non-existant class,
the dashboard was throwing errors. This was the case on Upcase, where
there are several dangling references from the `Classification` model to
the removed `Article` model.

When a model overrides `#to_param` to have more meaningful URLs,
Administrate was still trying to look the objects up by their `id`s
instead of by whatever attribute the `param` was representing.

Solution:
- Extract a `find_resource` method in dashboard controllers
- Devs can override the method to look up resources using custom logic

Side Effects:
- Add a custom to_param to Product model for testing

Why?

When we ran the generators on Hound, there was a lot of feedback that
people didn't want the extra generated controller files. We didn't
need to customize the controllers, and we ended up changing the
routing so all dashboards were served by a single controller.

This change makes a single controller the default. As demonstrated with
the still-present `Admin::CustomersController`, users can still override
the controllers themselves.

We left the `Admin::CustomersController` in place because there are
tests that exercise `Administrate::ApplicationController` through it.

When running the engine against a demo app I received an error stating
the following: `uninitialized constant Administrate::Page`. Looking
through the source I noticed that there was no explicit definition of
that module. This commit adds that file and defines `Administrate::Page`
explicitly.

Through the process of adding that file and module I also noticed that
the directory structure containing all classes related to pages were
placed under `administrate/pages` but were defined as
`Administrate::Page`. The convention for structuring ruby libraries is
to match modules with their directory structures and vice versa. This
commit also makes that update to follow said conventions."

`title_attribute` was being used to display a link to each resource
throughout the dashboards.

It was acting as a kind of unique identifier, but was restrictive in
several ways:

- The title_attribute had to correspond with a method on the model.
  It couldn't be computed from several methods.
- Only the current dashboard could look up the correct method for
  displaying a resource. This causes problems for relationships like the
  BelongsToAdapter and HasManyAdapter, which need to know how to display
  other objects.

Moving to #to_s is good in several ways:

- It makes representing an object super easy, with a single consistent
  method to call on each object.
- It encourages developers to write good `#to_s` methods on each of
  their objects.

And bad in several ways:

- If `#to_s` is not defined on a model, it defaults to the object's ID.
  This is not tied in any way to the database, so an object's identifier
  wouldn't be consistent throughout the dashboard.
- If the user hasn't defined `#to_s` on a model, it doesn't noisily fail
  by default. If we wanted to noisily fail, we'd have to check against
  the default `#to_s` string and raise an error.

To fix the bad effects, there's room for a separate gem that generates
better default `#to_s` methods for objects, by trying for attributes
like `name` or `title`, and defaulting to `id` if those are not present."
