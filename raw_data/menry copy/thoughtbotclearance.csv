where the controllers can still call sign_in to get current_user working
correctly and to leave the session in a state where rack will notice the user
has been signed in and set the cookie."

Recently, to prevent password reset token via HTTP, there was
an update to store the reset token in session and then redirect
to the same edit page without token in the params, this works
great but the way we find user introduced a new issue like 749

If the user request a password reset and click on that link and
for some reason that reset was unsuccessful and then the user
request another link then it does not work and it keep sending
the user to the `password/new` page again and again.

Why is that happening?

The password `#edit`, and `#update` actions has before filter
to ensure the token is valid for an existing user, and in the
underneath the `ensure_existing_user` is trying to find a user
by the session token / parameter token.

But it gives precedence to the session token first and in above
scenario, although the user has a new token in the URL but the
session still holds the old token which is not valid anymore
and that creates the indefinite loop.

This commit adds a little tweaks by switching the order and
when a URL contains the `token` parameter then it updates the
session reset token and then redirect to the same edit page.
This way it updates the session &everything else stays same

By rotating this token, we can prevent session fixation attacks. This is
the simplest explanation of session fixation that I've found, and I do
not want to recreate it here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_fixation

By rotating the CSRF token on sign in, the attacker will be unable to
make authenticated requests using the known session ID as they will not
have access to the new CSRF token without an additional security
vulnerability.

While I believe this should cause most Clearance users no harm if
enabled by default, there's a chance that it may, particularly if sign
in is done via AJAX, as additional form submissions after sign in will
not have the updated CSRF token.

For that reason, this feature is behind a configuration setting. The
configuration is `nil` by default, which will generate a warning that
encourages the user to set it to `true`, but the warning can be silenced
by setting the configuration to any value."

The password reset token is included in the URL emailed to users who
request a password reset. When the user clicks the link, they are
brought to the password reset form. If instead of completing the form
the user clicks a link to another HTTPS resource that may be in the site
navigation, then the password reset token will be leaked to that
external site via HTTP referer (sic).

Taking advantage of this would require an attack to:

1. Control a site that is linked to on the password reset token
2. Capture any HTTP referers that contain the token
3. Use the referer URL to complete the password reset before the user
does so themselves.

This is a rather involved exploit, but something we should close
nonetheless. We address it in this change by requiring that the token be
present in the session rather than in the URL before the page is
displayed to the user. If the user hits the edit action with a token in
the URL, the token will be stored in the session and the user will be
redirected to the same URL minus the token.

This is a bit more complicated the another change I considered where we
simply rotate the token before the form is displayed. While this change
is more involved and less localized, it has the advantage of maintaining
the side-effect-free `get` (kind of - we do mutate the session)."

cleaned up the `password=` method. These private helper functions end up
getting mixed into the end application's `User` class because password
strategies are implemented as mixins. This causes issues if the user
class has `encrypt` or `cost` methods already. `attr_encrypted`, for
instance, mixes in its own `encrypt` method.

I considered renaming the helper functions, prefacing them with
`clearance_` or something similar. I also considered nesting the helpers
in a module and calling them as such. In the end, I felt inlining the
helpers made the code marginally less readable but fixed the conflict
problem without the added ceremony of a module."

Password validations only run when `skip_password_validation?` returns
false. The idea of that method is that it returns true whenever the user
requires a password and a change to their password was attempted.
Previously, we relied on the developer explicitly having set
`password_changing = true` on the instance to detect an attempt to
change the password.

This worked fine when the developer used `update_password` to change an
existing users password. However, using other methods to update a
password or even creating a new user (like in the `users#create` action)
did not set this attribute.

This was okay for our built-in validations (just presence) because of
the way `password=` was implemented. However, users that added their own
validations (like validating password length) and properly added the
`unless: :skip_password_validation?` modifier to their validation found
that their validations were not running for new users.

To fix this, we rely on ActiveRecord/ActiveModel's built-in dirty
tracking to check if encrypted password has changed rather than using a
manual attribute. We further tell the user model that calling
`password=` at all will automatically mark the encrypted_password as
dirty, regardless of what the password strategy ultimately does.

Making the change in `User` and calling `super` means that all password
strategies -- even custom strategies -- get this improved behavior.

Now that we're using dirty tracking properly, we can deprecate the
`password_changing` attribute, as it is no longer used.

This brings versions of the controller spec helpers `sign_in` and
`sign_in_as` to view and helper specs and does so in a way that avoids
people getting [errors from verified partial doubles][1]. The downside
of this approach is that it changes the subject under test (the view) by
introducing these helper methods directly on it. I don't think that's
much different than controller helper methods, though.

There is potential for confusion among users that might expect calling
`sign_in` or `sign_in_as` would come with all of the same side effects
that calling these methods from a controller or controller spec would.
In reality, they are just fancy ways to set the `current_user` local
variable and have no side effects. I feel that the potential confusion
from this has less impact than having to remember different helper
method names depending on whether you are in a controller spec or a view
spec.

As part of this change, I moved the existing
`Clearance::Testing::Helpers` module to
`Clearance::Testing::ControllerHelpers` and deprecated the old name.
This is a more accurate name and allows us to isolate the `ViewHelpers`
which are not useful in test_unit.

To get the test suite to run in under 2.2, I:

* Excluded Rails 3.2 under Ruby 2.2 from appraisals as it is not

run there.

option was on the users remember token would be completely wiped out
when they hit an HTTP page. Even returning to HTTPS would not restore
the user's token. With this change in place, the HTTP response would
simply not set a remember token cookie, but switching back to HTTPS
would allow the client to send its previously existing cookie.

There was an existing test for this, but it was passing incorrectly. The

automatically use the queue configured with Active Job in order to
background the sending of email. With no queue configured, it will be
delivered synchronously. The old `#deliver` method still works, but
generates deprecation warnings.

The rest of the changes were related to the test suite:
* Add a Rails 4.2 appraisal
* Update cucumber steps to remove unnecessary gems from generated apps.
* Simplify appraisal dependencies thanks to the above.
* Fixed `forgeries_controller_spec`. This is still a brittle way to test
  this functionality but at least it works across Rails versions.
* Removed deprecation related to test suite ordering in the test app
  that is loaded.

There remains a single (repeated) deprecation when running specs on 4.2
which comes from RSpec and will be addressed by upgrading to
`rspec-rails` 3.1 (see [`rspec-rails` issue]. That work will be in a
separate pull-request.

Running `rails generate clearance:specs` in an `rspec-rails` 3 project
resulted in broken tests due to the different `spec_helper` files
generated between versions 2 and 3.

In RSpec 3, feature specs should require `rails_helper` rather than
`spec_helper`. Additionally, neither default helper recursively requires
files in `spec/support` as `spec_helper` did under RSpec 2.

To remedy these problems, several changes were made:

1. The specs are now generated from template files which require the
correct helper based on your rspec-rails version.

2. Instead of configuring RSpec globally so we can use FactoryGirl
syntax methods we now explicitly call `FactoryGirl.create` where needed.

3. Instead of relying on Clearance feature spec helpers to be mixed in
to all features we now only do this when the Clearance feature helpers
are explicitly required.

4. Instead of a global `before` to empty ActionMailer deliveries, we now
do this explicitly in the specs that require it.

We're trying to make fewer assumptions about how a user sets up their
test suite, how they use Factory Girl, etc. The result is that if you
use RSpec and Factory Girl, generated specs should just work and should
not screw up any other tests."

There is a configuration option that allows for sign up to easily be
disabled. With this enabled, the `sign_up_path` route helper is not
defined. This causes a 500 when a user login fails because the default
I18n message uses `sign_up_path` for interpolation.

I opted to remove the interpolation, and thus the sign up link, from the
default sign in failure message. This is perhaps somewhat less helpful,
but it makes for a working out of the box experience for people who
disable sign up.

An alternative would be to add another flash message specifically for
this case and add conditionals to `DefaultSignInGuard` (or a helper
object) to handle it. I felt that the increased complexity of that
solution wasn't worth it."

There has been confusion about the `authorize` method residing in the
`Authentication` module:

* The `authorize` method performs authorization - it denies access to
  unauthenticated users.
* It is assumed that controllers would override `authorize` for
  controllers that require specific authentication.
* It's sort of strange that `Clearance::Authentication` contains a bunch
  of authorization logic.

So, we:

* Split `Clearance::Controller` into `Clearance::Authentication` and
  `Clearance::Authorization`, both of which get mixed into
  `Clearance::Controller`.
* Mix `Clearance::Controller` into `ApplicationController` in the install
  generator.

As reported on:

https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/issues/250

By default, the text on the password reset page read:

> We will email you a link to reset your password.

This implies that the system is already in the process of sending an
email,
and that no further action is required by the user. We have had multiple
users of our application fail to complete the password reset flow
because of
this confusion.

Here's how these users got stuck:

* Visit the login page.
* Enter their email address and an incorrect password.
* The application denies login with ""Bad email or password"" error.
* User gives up and clicks ""Forgot password?"" link.
* Reset password page loads with the text ""We will email you a link to
 reset your password."". User thinks they are done. (After all, they
 already provided their email address on the login page.)
* User never completes the reset password form. Telephones support
 complaining their password is not being reset.

Our fix was to change the password reset text to:

> To be emailed a link to reset your password, please enter your email
> address."
