By adding `pointer-events: none` to the img element, the browser pushes pointer events to the element below the img. That is, when you right click on the image, you're no longer able to download it.

As a result, we need to push the drag-data to a parent element so that you can still drag the image into Composer, InDesign etc."

It is more common to ask ""what images can I use (under-quota)"" rather than ""what images can I not use (over-quota)"".

Whilst the former could be expressed as not(over-quota), it is by far the more common query so should be the default; to get over-quota we now do not(under-quota)."

12 minutes was a slightly arbitrary number taken from another prout config. As it turns out, it's slightly too short for Grid; this is perhaps the result of a long CI queue or it taking too long for the new instances in a deploy to report healthy. In any case, increasing the time to 30 minutes will have the effect of being more tolerant and less chatty whilst still remaining useful."

When performing ES date aggregations, we're using the month as the interval.

Our test images would sometimes span two months and sometimes one month, this is because we were doing:
- Image A uploaded today
- Image B uploaded 25 days ago

Between 26th and 31st of every month, this test would fail because the number of monthly buckets would be one. However from 1st to 25th of every month, there would be two monthly buckets and the tests would pass.

Image B was a fairly recent addition, hence we've never seen this behaviour until now."

Setting the `cropType` query string will set a value in session storage, which is later read to freeze the crop type available. This is useful in embedded Grid when the ratio matters, for example a video thumbnail should be a 16:9 ratio.

Allow session storage to be cleared if `cropType === 'all'`. That is, we're happy to crop to any ratio."

- if we're removing it from a photoshoot, remove its inferred rights
- if we're moving it into a photoshoot, recalculate its inferred rights:
  - if the photoshoot has images with explicit rights, use the latest
  - else remove the inferred rights

Image has explicit rights:
- if the image was in a photoshoot, refresh the inferred rights for images in that photoshoot:
  - use the latest explicit rights in the photoshoot that's not this image. If none, clear inferred rights across the photoshoot
- if we're moving into a photoshoot and this image's rights is the latest, copy the rights across the photoshoot
- if we're moving into a photoshoot and this image's rights is not the latest, do nothing (TODO record these as a metric to know how often it happens)"

When we send an image for syndication, we record a syndication usage.

In order to not send the same image again and again, remove images with a syndication usage from the syndication tier.

This is a slightly hacky solution as it doesn't scale beyond one syndication partner. For example, if partner A takes an image, partner B will no longer see it. However, we only have 1 partner at the moment.

A scalable solution would be to record a syndication key against an usage and filter accordingly. We could do this once we have to support multiple syndication partners."

- Readonly - an Editorial Tool that needs Grid API access, such as Fronts. Can only perform GET actions.
- Syndication - a syndication partner. Can only GET images that are syndicatable, as informed by the RCS feed"

This seems to have been caused by a change in behaviour of the `.asOpt` method in Play. Before the upgrade to 2.6 if the field was missing it deserialised to a fully empty `Edits` object, presumably because everything has a default parameter including `ImageMetadata`. After the upgrade it was correctly returning `None`. Unfortunately the frontend now relies on that field being present (and empty if no userMetadata is present in Elasticsearch)."

* implement DELETE functionality

* delete all leases for media

* return 404 on leases by media when non available

* replace lease store

* use scanamo 0.2

* dont 404 when no leases for image

* no need to specify exception type

* add links to media-api for leases

* leases ui coming along. dates need maj0r werk.

* use latest version of scanamo

* add dynamo table to leases properties template

* add leases to procfile

* make post async

* better seperate responsibilities of lease controller and store

* merging in png changes

* finalizing leases ui

- croppable is correct but doesn't update on change

- tooltips now interpolate their content

- date range directive now has ""show extras"" to specify showing the facets from the main search page

- current lease has borders

- confirm delete on leases

* croppability updates when leases change

* making lease status a bar on top of lease element

* adding notes to display, simplifying text in lease

* js linting, much semi colons!

* renaming leaseService.canUserEdit because linter says it's invalid

* js linting

* ! fixed date selection and display !

* js linting	 again

* js lint

* fixing extra logic in OR for cropping

* PR feedback

- fixed time calculations from seconds to milliseconds
- lease now overrules metadata editor for cropping rights -> metadata editors can't crop images with deny leases
- removed unnecessary call to interpolate for tooltips
 - fixed alert on saving a lease without  ""access"" set

* js-hinting

* revert sneaky png stuff that snuck into my branch some how."

Benefits:
 - With the new `context` directive, the docker-compose.yml file is moved to the more standard project root
 - Docker 1.10 uses an internal DNS, which looks more reliable than injected hosts file; migrate to `depends_on` directive to signify dependancy order
 - No need for a dedicated shared volume container - use the new top level `volumes` directive, mounting `ivy` and `sbt` on the base `sbt` container
 - Initial testing suggests networking in Docker 1.10 is a lot more reliable (likely because of the new internal DNS)

Drawbacks:
 - docker-osx-dev doesn't handle the new top level `volumes` directive. For example, it warns of No such file or directory as it tries to sync grid/configs-vol grid/ivy-vol grid/sbt-vol."

In a selection of images, its not guaranteed that all images have the same metadata fields, e.g. some may not have a title. `allFields` is the set of all unique metadata fields in the selection of images. Now, we loop over `allFields` to find the corresponding value or undefined for an image.

For example, if there are two images selected and one has a title and the other doesn't, the `metadata` object now looks like `{""title"": Set {""title 1"", undefined}` rather then `{""title: Set {""title 1""}`. As we switch on the size of `metadata`, we now correctly display ""Multiple Titles"" rather than ""title 1""."
