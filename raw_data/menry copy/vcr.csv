* Add record_on_error configuration option

When you are TDD'ing an API integration and an error occurs it will
often be caused by an bug in the implementation. In that case no
interactions should be recorded, to avoid having to manually throw away
the cassette every test run until all bugs are solved.

When setting `record_on_error` to false, no interactions will be written
to disk when an error is raised inside the block that uses the cassette.

webmock uses the hashdiff gem, which recently introduced a deprecation
warning regarding the spelling of the `Hashdiff` constant.

```
The HashDiff constant used by this gem conflicts with another gem of a similar name.
As of version 1.0 the HashDiff constant will be completely removed and replaced by Hashdiff.
```

This warning in the output causes one of the vcr cucumber tests to fail.

The fix is to update to the latest version of the hashdiff gem, which is
currently in beta."

One VCR threading issue is that when multiple request come across in separate threads, the list interactions is not synchronized, causing errors due to loss of tracking of the un/used interactions.

This commit places two mutexes in the core sections of contention:

- the first instantiation of HTTPInteractionList, which without mutex, yields to a second instance overwriting the first (reference)
- the transfer of a given request from the unused interactions list to the used one, and other problems

Please note that this commit is not intended to make VCR thread safe in the absolute sense, but it intends to mitigate (possibly not solve) one specific threading problem experienced by multiple users.

Closes #200, depending on the maintaners intention towards VCR thread-safety."

This reverts commit c5e90d06ad8adb0cc066a04cb22fe22c3cc2935c.

Merging that commit caused the build to start failing due to the fact
that it changed where the bundled gems are installed, and our
warnings prevention assumes a warning originated from VCR (and thus is
worthy of failing the build) if it includes a filename that is in the
current working directory.  Previously the bundled gems were
installed outside of the working directory and thus warnings from
dependent gems (like WebMock) would not trigger a failure.

We should re-work the warnings prevention logic, but for now
I'm reverting this to get back to green."

Installing dependencies via Bundler can make up a large portion of
the build duration. Caching the bundle between builds drastically
reduces the time a build takes to run.

Caching does not become effective until this commit is merged
to master. At that point, `bundle install` on travis takes
20-30 seconds instead of several minutes. If a branch modifies
the gemspec, then that branch starts with the cache but still
uses the updated gemspec.

In my experience with travis-ci bundler cache, only the default
branch *writes* the cache. All other branches merely *read*.

When a request was made with the `followlocation: true`

Typhoeus passes this option to libcurl, and the redirect
is followed in native curl code, rather than in rubyland;
as a result we cannot record both the redirect response
and the followed responseâ€¦we just get the final followed
response. We were setting `effective_url` to the request url
but typhoeus internally sets it to the final url (after
all the redirects).  So, to play it back properly we have
to record that value.  I've added `adapter_metadata`

I got this warning from VCR on some tests using fog/excon to download a file from S3 over SSL:

WARNING: VCR could not extract a response from Excon error (#<OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: hostname does not match the server certificate>)

I discovered that the SSL cert verification for a real request w/o VCR was made against
`s3.amazonaws.com`, while the verification for the request being recorded by VCR was made
against `<bucket_name>.s3.amazonaws.com`. The difference is due to the fact that fog
constructs an Excon::Connection instance with a URI of `s3.amazonaws.com`, then makes a
request with a :host param set to the FQDN. Before this commit, VCR made the real
request by constructing a new Excon::Connection instance with the URI set to the full
URI, and it caused the SSL cert verification failure.

This fixes it by ensuring the ""real request"" connection instance is constructed with
the same args as the original connection instance."

When the :redirects option is used with em-http-request,
WebMock's after_request hook gets invoked twice for a
single request. It appears to be doing it one for the original
request and once for the following redirect request. However,
the second time it does not actually have the new URL, and,
furthermore, the globally_stub_request hook is only invoked
once. As a result, the @__typed_vcr_request ivar has already
been removed, and we were getting nil on the second after_request
hook invocation.

Our fix is to make our WebMock library hook tolerant of the
@__typed_vcr_request hook not being present. Some things
(such as filtering an after_http_request hook based on request
type) will not work properly but the main VCR functionality can
work this way.

Closes #171."

For issue #91.

Note that when using Typhoeus or WebMock, it's not guaranteed that the after_request hook will fire for every request; if an error (such as a socket error) occurs before the request completes then the Typhoeus/WebMock after_request hook will not fire, which means VCR will not be able to fire its after_http_request hook in turn.  There's not much I can do about this, unfortunately.

For Excon, Faraday and FakeWeb, I use an ensure block to guarantee that the hook will be invoked.  This is possible because VCR wraps the entire request for these library hooks."

This reverts commit e27202d5b8080314d854fc5d83d8fdaa34a78e31.

Unfortunately, 1.8 and 1.9 blocks have different behavior:

block = Proc.new { |x| puts x.inspect }
block.call(1, 2)

On 1.8, x gets [1, 2]; on 1.9, x gets 1.  So this VariableArgsBlockCaller is more important than I thought to maintain 1.8 compatibility."

- Typhoeus would have a single header value like 'text/html' when recording, but it was in an array on playback ['text/html'].
- Faraday headers are returned with lower case keys, and I was not handling this properly at all.

There are a few adapter/http library combinations that do not work properly when there are multiple values for one header:
- Faraday/Patron
- WebMock/HTTP Client
- WebMock/EM HTTP Request
- WebMock/Curb

I think this is due to a bug in those libraries.  I could change the way I pass headers to Faraday and WebMock, but that would break the other libs used with Faraday and WebMock (i.e. Faraday/Net::HTTP or WebMock/Net::HTTP) so I think it's best for now to just leave these pending.

Syck (the default YAML engine) modifies strings when they are
round-tripped through it: ""1/n /n2"" becomes ""1/n/n2"".  Psych doesn't.

This doesn't usually matter, but can occasionally cause problems when
using an HTTP client that raises errors when the content_length header
does not match the actual content length (as does Mechanize).

To use psych, you may need to reinstall ruby 1.9.2 with psych support.
On OSX with homebrew and rvm, this will do the trick:

brew install libyaml
rvm install ruby-1.9.2 --with-libyaml-dir=/usr/local
