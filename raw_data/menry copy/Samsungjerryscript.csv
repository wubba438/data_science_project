- Remove ecma_gc_get_object_next since it became unnecessary

This PR is a general cleanup for garbage collection and memory
allocation code paths.

Changes:
  * Removed an unnecesary local variable from 'ecma_gc_mark'.
  * Refactored 'ecma_gc_run' to have an implicit list head during
    iteration, which results in one less condition in the loops,
    and changed the loops to use compressed pointers to reduce the
    overall amount of compression/decompression.
  * Renamed 'jmem_free_unused_memory_severity_t' to 'jmem_pressure_t',
    and added additional values.
  * Removed 'jmem_free_unused_memory_callback', instead
    'ecma_free_unused_memory' is now called directly.
  * Reworked 'ecma_free_unused_memory' to handle all code paths related
    to 'jmem_pressure_t', and moved all relevant code paths into this
    function. This simplifies the code paths in other places.
  * Reworked 'jmem_heap_gc_and_alloc_block' to be more streamlined.
  * Changed mem-stats to not report unused pool chunks as allocated
    memory.
  * Created an allocator internal API for allocating/freeing memory blocks
    that are not reported as used memory in mem-stats.
  * Removed iteration statistics for the jerry allocator from mem-stats,
    as they don't provide any actually useful information.

  duplicate symbol errors in command line tools), and add
  `-fsanitize=fuzzer` to the libfuzzer driver only.

- Make ASan optional when building with libfuzzer to allow the user
  to choose freely from available sanitizers (e.g., UBSan, MSan,
  HWASan).

- Stabilize libfuzzer by resetting PRNG seed at every invocation.

The NuttX target has been problematic for some time, due to the fact
that NuttX apps are built with NuttX's own libc implementation, while
the default-port in JerryScript was compiled with the host libc, which
caused a mismatch between the two.

In order to work around this issue, most of the port implementation is already
duplicated in the NuttX target's jerry_main.c.

This PR adds a NuttX specific port implementation by moving the already
implemented port functions from jerry_main into a separate file, adding
implementation for the missing functions, and disabling the default-port
in JerryScript.

This change checks endians in case no toolchain is found and

https://github.com/matedabis/jerryscript/blob/gcov_coverage_tester/tests/gcov-tests/gcovtester.py

While measuring the branch coverage we dont count JERRY_ASSERT s. The results are measured by running all the test scripts, with the modifications in the PRs.

Branch coverage including pando-project#2682 and pando-project#2674:
	-before: 399 / 476
	-after:  472 / 476

There are 28 functions in ecma-builtin-array-prototype.c, we hit 14 from them.
The other 14 functions are either already covered, or we could not improve the coverage of it.

More information about the coverage improvement and the branches not reached:

While improving the coverage we found an unnecessary condition check, which can not be false in any cases.

There are quite a few configuration macros in the project.
As discussed in the #2520 issue there are a few awkward constructs.

Main changes:

* Renamed all CONFIG_DISABLE_<name>_BUILTIN macro to JERRY_BUILTIN_<name> format.
* The special JERRY_BUILTINS macro specifies the basic config for all es5.1 builtins.
* Renamed all CONFIG_DISABLE_ES2015_<name> to JERRY_ES2015_<name> format.
* The special JERRY_ES2015 macro specifies the basic config for all es2015 builtins.
* Renamed UNICODE_CASE_CONVERSION to JERRY_UNICODE_CASE_CONVERSION.
* Renamed ENABLE_REGEXP_STRICT_MODE to JERRY_REGEXP_STRICT_MODE.
* All options (in this change) can have a value of 0 or 1.
* Renamed ENABLE_REGEXP_STRICT_MODE to JERRY_REGEXP_STRICT_MODE.
  JERRY_REGEXP_STRICT_MODE is set to 0 by default.
* Reworked CONFIG_ECMA_NUMBER_TYPE macro to JERRY_NUMBER_TYPE_FLOAT64 name and now
  it uses the value 1 for 64 bit floating point numbers and 0 for 32 bit floating point
  number.
  By default the 64-bit floating point number mode is enabled.
* All new JERRY_ defines can be used wit the `#if ENABLED (JERRY_...)` construct to
  test if the feature is enabled or not.
* Added/replaced a few config.h includes to correctly propagate the macro values.
* Added sanity checks for each macro to avoid incorrectly set values.
* Updated profile documentation.
* The CMake feature names are not updated at this point.

Introduce a new way of building: before any file is compiled
all source files are combined into a single C file and all
header files into a single H file (per subdir).

This new approach makes it possible to quickly integrate JerryScript
into other projects:

```
$ gcc -o demo demo.c jerryscript.c jerryscript-port-default.c -lm
```

To use the source generator run:
```
$ cmake -Bbuild_dir -H. -DENABLE_ALL_IN_ONE_SOURCE=ON
$ make -C build_dir generate-single-source
```

This will create the following files in the `build_dir`:
* jerryscript.c
* jerryscript.h
* jerryscript-config.h
* jerryscript-port-default.c
* jerryscript-port-default.h

Until now, the ESP8266 target used a non-tagged git hash revision
of the RTOS SDK (from Oct 2017). Moreover, the compiler was also a
custom-built gcc.

This commit sets the RTOS SDK version to v2.1.0, released Oct 2018,
which is the latest old-style SDK for ESP. The commit also changes
the used gcc to an Espressif-provided pre-built toolchain, which is
tagged for the (latest) v3.0.1 SDK release.

(The SDK bump is not to the latest SDK version because the new
v3.x line of the SDK is ""ESP-IDF style"", which is incompatible with
the current target code base. On the other hand, the toolchain
comes from the latest SDK release because the v2.x line had no
pre-built toolchain suggestions -- but it builds v2.x sources
correctly.)

The following stucture was highly frequented in the code base:

 - Get a builtin object // This operation increases the reference count of the object
 - Use it for create a new object
 - Deref the builtin object

After a builtin has been instantiated there is always at least one reference to ""keep it alive"",
so increase/decrease the reference count for getting the value only is unnecessary.

TizenRT gives an opportunity to use the C99 standard boolean (that works
well if that is set).

There was an issue in the Promise implementation where properties were accessible from JavaScript.
ie. `Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 0, {})` could modify properties which should've been inaccessible.
The reason behind that is somewhat interesting as 0-7 were the same values as the enum values in the property list of the Promise object.
Changing these properties to internal, makes them inaccessible from JS side.

Also some tests have been changed, namely 2490 and 2465.
The 2490 one got renamed, and all of the testcases from the issue have been added.
2465 got changed as well, since currently our Promise implementation can't display Promise errors, so we should check if an error is correctly returned.

Fixes #2490

There was an issue not checking if recv() set the error value to EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN (both equals 11).
If recv() returns 0 that means the connection was gracefully closed from the other side. However, if you are using non-blocking sockets, and recv() returns 0, but sets the errno to EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN it means the socket operation would block.

Rationale:
- There is no port under targets/ that would use it. All of them
  turn it off when building.
- That's no surprise, as jerry-libc supports no barebone MCUs but
  posix targets with syscalls only. Actually, that's Linux only,
  because macOS builds have turned off the use of jerry-libc a
  while ago.
- And there is no point in maintaining a highly restricted set of
  libc functions: as soon as someone wants to use JerryScript in a
  scenario that needs more functions than jerry-main, they have to
  choose a different libc (most problably the compiler's default
  one).

I think that we should not keep supporting an otherwise unused
library for the purposes of jerry-main on arm/x86/x64-linux  only.

The fix is just an explicit casting of those types to the desired target

The license checker previously assumed that the
lines of the license will always end with \n
characters. However when checking a file
it could happen that other line endings are
returned (should only happen for test files) thus
the checker can incorrectly report invalid license
as the line endings are incorrect.

Additional note #1: in Python when reading a file
in text mode it can happen that the line endings are
converted to the host system's line ending.
However on Travis the conversion did not happen when
using the open built-in method. By switching to the
io.open call the conversion is enforced and
all line endings are converted to '\n' regardless of
the host system's line ending.

Additional note #2: it is possible that there
are input test files which are not utf-8 conformant
(eg.: to test the parser). These files can't be read
as utf-8 strings and an exception would occur.
By ignoring these errors the tool can check
the file's license. In the license text there is no
invalid utf-8 character so the check will work
correctly.

In `tools/build.py`:
- For the sake of readability, group CLI arguments as general build
  options, options to control the building of components, and
  component-specific options.
- To prevent duplications, remove the defaults from those CLI
  arguments that correspond to CMake options and have defaults in
  any of the CMakeLists. Should any of the defaults change, they
  will have to be changed at a single place only. (Those options
  that are not set on the command line of `tools/build.py` are not
  passed as options to `cmake` either.)
- Convert `--unittests` and `--doctests` to ON/OFF options like the
  rest of the component switches.
- Touch on some of the help messages of the CLI arguments.

Other changes:
- The change in `--unittests` and `--doctests` is a slightly CLI-
  breaking change of `tools/build.py`. Thus, follow up on this in
  `tools/run-tests.py`.
- Move `ENABLE_ALL_IN_ONE` into `jerry-core` as it is not a general
  option but specific to that component.
- Remove the forcing of `ENABLE_ALL_IN_ONE` for some compilers/
  platforms as it is still an option, not a hard requirement.

None of the code paths have been tested for long and especially the
Freya code paths have been long abandoned. This patch:
- Merges Valgrind-Freya into Valgrind code path (there should be no
  need to choose between them, Valgrind should work just fine).
- Removes leftover code (`VALGRIND_FREYA_CHECK_MEMPOOL_REQUEST` and
  `valgrind_freya_mempool_request`).
- Adds `JMEM_` prefix to Valgrind-related macros (to correctly
  leave the `VALGRIND_` prefix to Valgrind).
- Moves the definition of the Valgrind-related macros to a common
  header to avoid duplication.

Note: Adding a CI job to perform Valgrind Memchecks is left for
follow-up as it turns out to be excessively slow (>50 mins for a
`--jerry-tests --jerry-test-suite` run, and even a simple
`--jerry-tests` may get terminated prematurely because of timeout
issues).

`JERRY_UNREACHABLE`s often signal code structure that could be
improved: they can usually either be rewritten to `JERRY_ASSERT`s
or eliminated by restructuring loops, `if`s or `#if`s. Roughly,
the only valid occurences are in default cases of `switch`es. And
even they can often be merged into non-default cases.

Moreover, it is dangerous to write meaningful code after
`JERRY_UNREACHABLE` because it pretends as if there was a way to
recover from an impossible situation.

This patch rewrites/eliminates `JERRY_UNREACHABLE`s where possible
and removes misleading code from after them.

In general, public headers should not have compiler-specific
constructs but both the core and the port headers have attributes,
which are non-standard. It's better to factor out such constructs
to a common place (a new header) and hide them behind macros, which
can then be defined on a per-compiler basis.

This patch moves the existing definitions of function attributes and
likely/unlikely builtins to the new header. At the same time, it
unifies the names of these attribute defines and where they are
used. Moreover, it touches on jerry-main and removes the uses of
`__attribute__((unused))` entirely and replaces them with the
elsewhere used `(void) ...` pattern.

This patch adds a new finalize_cb callback to jerry_context_data_manager_t.
The callback is run as the very last thing in jerry_cleanup, after the VM has been torn down entirely.
There was already the deinit_cb, which is run while the VM is still in the process of being torn down.
The reason the deinit_cb is not always sufficient is that there may still be objects alive (because they still being referenced) that have native pointers associated with the context manager that is being deinit'ed.
As a result, the free_cb's for those objects can get called *after* the associated context manager's deinit_cb is run. This makes cleanup of manager state that is depended on by the live objects impossible to do in the deinit_cb. That type of cleanup can only be done when all values have been torn down completely.

In 1.10, Zephyr RTOS switched to CMake as means to generate application
makefiles. Consequently, drop Makefile, and introduce CMakeLists.txt,
and update master Makefile.zephyr accordingly.

With these changes, take a chance to make following ""cosmetic"" changes:

1. Make ""qemu_x86"" board target the default instead of ""arduino_101"".
Arduino 101 is just one of the boards of many supported by Zephyr
(and thus JerryScript port), while qemu_x86 is something everyone has.

2. Zephyr make target to run QEMU switched from ""qemu"" to ""run"".

3. Don't rely that there's zephyr.strip, it's presence is now
board-dependent. The most we can rely on is zephyr.elf.

targets: zephyr: Remove deprecated prj.mdef file.

MDEF files have been deprecated and ignored for few Zephyr releases.

targets: zephyr: Increase main (i.e. interpreter) thread stack size.

qemu_x86 target now has stack guard enabled by default and it trips with
the default stack size. Set it to 2K for now.

targets: zephyr: Makefile.travis: Update for Zephyr 1.10.

Zephyr 1.10 requires SDK 0.9.2 and CMake 3.8.2.

Also, don't hardcode CC path, it depends on a board and choosed
automatically by Zephyr build system.

On Travis the Python (by default) is a bit old
and causes problems when the yotta is being used.

Switching to Python 2.7.13 solves half of the problem.

The other problem is the pyOpenSSL 17.5 and Linux
library incompatibilities. Thus we force the pyOpenSSL
to a pre-17.5 version.

Until now, the engine's feature set was configurable either via
`CONFIG_*` macro guards defined individually on compiler command
line or via profiles (which are text files listing macro guards,
picked up by the cmake build system and turning them into compiler
command line options). And the features under profile control are
all enabled by default (i.e., all macros are `CONFIG_DISABLE_*`).

This causes a maintenance issue when new features are added to the
engine, because the disabling macros have to be added to all
profiles that don't include the new features. This can even cause
""compatibility break"" for applications that embed JerryScript but
don't use the cmake or the python build system, because then
profiles are unavailable and all feature disabling guards have to
be explicitly passed to the compiler. (I.e., if such an application
wants to use the ES5.1 feature set, it must define all the ES2015
disable macros; if the engine is developed further and a new ES2015
feature gets implemented, then the new feature will sneak into the
application's binary unless its own build system is changed to add
the new feature guard.) Even the in-repo example Curie BSP target
seems to have suffered from this maintenance problem.

This patch introduces two new grouping macro guards that enable the
disabling of all ES5.1 builtins and all ES2015 features. As the
grouping logic is in config.h, the maintenance of non-cmake-based
build systems becomes easier (and there is no change for the python
and cmake-based build systems).

The 'external' toolchain file does nothing but transitively sets
some cmake system variables from values received on the command
line, and forcibly sets the C compiler. However, the same cmake
system variables can be directly set via the command line, together
with the C compiler, and specifying a toolchain is not a must.
Thus, this patch drops the superfluous 'external' toolchain file
and updates cmake-based targets to invoke cmake in a simpler form.

Related changes in this commit:
- While updating the cmake invocations, all the command line
  arguments have been reviewed and simplified (removed those, which
  did not change the defaults).
- Removed unnecessary forced C compiler settings from some
  toolchain files (and/or changed them to setting the ""compiler
  works"" flag to true, thus keeping cmake's compiler identification
  logic but disabling some of its overzealous compiler sanity
  checks).

Some benchmark suites contain test cases that have nonreproducible
behaviour. This is mostly caused by relying on ""now"" when dealing
with dates or timestamps, instead of using a fixed moment. (A
notorious example is the crypto-aes.js test case of the sunspider
bechmark suite, where the heap memory consumption can vary between
34K-41K heap because of using `(new Date()).getTime()`.)

This commit renames the jerry-minimal command line tool to
jerry-test (to better reflect its purpose) and adds extra code,
which intercepts some calls to libc (`gettimeofday`, `rand`) and
pins their results to some fixed values. This makes the tool
useless in a general case but ensures stable results when
benchmarking -- for which it is mostly used.

As a side effect, the commit also changes jerry-libc by making all
libc functions weak symbols to allow their override from
application code.

* Replace JERRY_JS_PARSER feature guard with JERRY_DISABLE_JS_PARSER

All feature guards of jerry-core are deciding about the inclusion
or exclusion of a feature based on the state (defined or undefined)
of a macro -- except for the JS parser guard, which requires
`JERRY_JS_PARSER` to be defined with a value of either 0 or 1. This
has some issues:
- The engine cannot be built with a ""clean"" compiler invocation,
  i.e., without any `-D` command line macro definitions. This is
  painful for targets that must use a different build system from
  the project's own python/cmake-based one.
- Some build systems in targets and even some code in jerry-code
  are already confused about the different semantics of
  `JERRY_JS_PARSER`, and simply define it without a value and make
  decisions based on the macro being simply defined or not.

This patch renames the guard to `JERRY_DISABLE_JS_PARSER` and makes
use of it in jerry-core based on its state, not based on its value.
As obvious from the guard name, the default for the JS parser is
that it is included in the build.

The patch also touches those targets in the repository that
explicitly defined the original macro (correctly or incorrectly).

* Make cppcheck verbose

Cppcheck can be quite slow sometimes, especially on Travis CI,
which has a ""10 mins without output means failure"" rule. As the
code base of the project grows, we start to undeterministically
fall over that limit. Thus, this PR makes cppcheck verbose to
ensure that it keeps Travis CI continuously fed with output.

In my opinion it is better to set the function as a property, so it is released automatically.

This extension provides the following facilities:
  - registering modules,
  - module resolvers, and
  - an API for retrieving a module instance given its name.

A module is defined as a global static structure containing a pointer
to a string which is the name of the module, and a pointer to a function
which will be called when an instance of the module is needed.

A module resolver is a function that accepts a string holding the name
of the module and returns a `jerry_value_t` in an out-parameter and
`true` if the module was found, or `false` if it was not. If it returns
`true` and the out-parameter has the error flag set then the API will
pass it through without caching.

This extension provides a built-in module resolver which attempts to
load modules that follow the above module definition.

The API provided by this extension invokes all module resolvers it
receives in sequence to attempt to resolve the name of a single module.
After one resolver returns `true` and a `jerry_value_t` that represents
the module the API stops iterating over the remaining resolvers and
caches the value if its error flag is not set. It then returns the
`jerry_value_t`. The API will return a `jerry_value_t` containing an
error indicating that the module was not found if it reaches the end of
the list of resolvers. The error it returns has an extra property
`""moduleName""` the value of which is a string containing the name of the

- On OSX, `find` is more picky about its arguments than on Linux
  and requires the start directory(-ies) to be explicitly mentioned
  before the expressions (a.k.a. ""primaries""). However, until now,
  the `pylint` runner script called `find` without a start dir,
  which caused an error on OSX.

- Until now, `find` looked for python scripts in all subdirectories
  of the project, causing `pylint` to check scripts under `targets/`
  and `tests/test262` (if `test262` was checked out). However, the
  files under `targets/` are less strictly controlled while
  `test262` is completely beyond the control of the project. This
  caused a lot of superfluous lint warnings.

This patch makes the `pylint` runner script call `find` in the
cross-platform way, and also limits the scope of the lint checks to
the `tools/` and `jerry-debugger/` directories.

This approach has the benefit that it does not require any *a priori*
initialization, and that each context pointer is identified by the way
in which it was created. Additionally, retrieving the context pointer
now requires that the entity responsible for creating/destroying it
(the manager) be given. Since managers are stored in global static
const structures, they should not normally be visible across source
files, and thus there should be no danger that a context item will be
retrieved by the wrong manager and thus cast into the wrong data type.

Since the items are stored in a linked list, their number will be
limited to exactly as many as are needed for a given context, with the
caveat that storing too many on a context will cause slow retrieval.

Thanks @mhdawson for the idea!

Moved all public API headers under the `jerry-core/include`
directory. This makes installing all the public headers easier.
Also, should we have new public headers in the future, their
installation will be automatic, there will be no need to update the
build files. Moreover, this aligns better with the structure of
other libraries in the project (in those cases, public headers
always reside in `<library>/include`).

Moved all public API implementations under the `jerry-core/api`
directory. This cleans up the root directory of `jerry-core`,
moving all implementation code under ""modules"", i.e.,
subdirectories. This also makes the future splitting of the big and
monolithic `jerry.c` along features easier, if needed. (Debugger
and snapshot-related functions are already in separate sources.)

Notes:
* `jerryscript.h` is split up to separate header files along
  feature boundaries. These new headers are included by
  `jerryscript.h`, so this is not a breaking change but header
  modularization only.
* `jerry-snapshot.h` is still under `jerry-core/api`, keeping it as
  a non-public header.
* This commit also adapts all targets to the include path change.

The built-in `print` is removed from jerry-core, but an external
`print` implementation is added to jerry-main. From now on, all
embedders of the engine have to implement their own `print` if they
need such a functionality.

For printing results in REPL mode of jerry-main, the external
`print` handler is called directly instead of looking up the `print`
function registered into the global object. (The two are the same,
but the indirection is not needed anymore.)

Because jerry-core does not contain `print` anymore,
`jerry_port_console` is removed from the port API. The default port
is updated, i.e., the implementation of `jerry_port_console` is
removed. Additionally, all references to `jerry_port_console` in
jerry-main are replaced by `printf`.

Speculatively, `jerry_port_console` is also removed from all
non-default targets. Most targets implemented it for the sake of the
engine only; in those targets the removal was trivial. Where the
function was called from the embedder application as well, the
calls were replaced with equivalents (e.g., `printf`, `printk`).

NOTE 1: This is a breaking change!

NOTE 2: This patch still leaves several targets without a JS `print`
implementation.

PR #1505 added support for TI compiler. It explicitly added a

added a more generic approach to signal such forced settings and
adapted the TI-specific static linking notification to this
approach. However, it turned out that TI forcibly changed another
setting, too: it disabled release binary stripping, but without
notification. This patch fixes this by moving the setting override
to a consistent place and adding a notification.

PR #1505 also added some source code changes, most importantly a
complex struct initialization for a variable in
`ecma-objects-general.c`. However, that initialization was coded
as a macro to trick the style checker. This patch gets rid of that
macro and uses proper C99 struct initializer with designators.

This commit changes the concept of JerryScript port implementations
from a simple directory of C source files (which get injected among
the sources of `jerry-core`) into a proper static library (which
may be linked to an application together with `jerry-core`). As a
consequence, this commit introduces a new library to the
JerryScript component architecture: the sources of the default port
implementation form `jerry-port-default`.

Changes in more detail:

- The sources in `targets/default` are moved to `jerry-port/default`
  and are turned into a proper static library.
  - Actually, the default port implementation has two library
    variants, one that implements the bare minimum only
    (`jerry-port-default-minimal`) and one that has some extra
    functionalities specific to this implementation (the ""full""
    `jerry-port-default`).
  - The new libraries have an interface header in
    `jerry-port/default/include`, which extends the common
    `jerryscript-port.h` API with functions specific to these
    libraries.
  - All non-standard port functions have now the
    `jerry_port_default_` prefix (this affects `jobqueue_init` and
    `jobqueue_run`).
  - The jobqueue implementation functions became config macro
    independent: it is now the responsibility of the linker to pick
    the needed objects from the library, and omit those (e.g.,
    jobqueue-related code) that are not referenced.
  - Build of the libraries can be controlled with the new
    `JERRY_PORT_DEFAULT` cmake option.

- The cmake option `PORT_DIR` is dropped, and `PORT_DIR/*.c` is not
  appended to `jerry-core` sources.
  - Instead, the `jerry` tool of `jerry-main` links to
    `jerry-port-default`, while `jerry-minimal` links to
    `jerry-port-default-minimal`.
  - `tests/unit-core` tests are also linked to
    `jerry-port-default-minimal`.

- Tools adapted.
  - `build.py` has `--jerry-port-default` instead of `--port-dir`.
  - `check-*.sh` have paths updated (`jerry-port/default` instead
    of `targets/default`).

- Miscellaneous.
  - Dropped `#ifndef`s from `jerryscript-port.h`. It is a public
    header of the `jerry-core` library, which means that it must
    not contain configuration-dependent parts (once the library is
    built with some config macros and the archive and the headers
    are installed, there is no way for the header to tell what
    those config macrose were).
  - Added documentation comments to the JobQueue Port API (in
    `jerryscript-port.h`) and to several default port
    implementation functions (in `jerry-port/default`).

The `conversions` and `ranges` files had separate generators, which
shared some functionality through a 3rd python module, and were
quite similar to each other -- but also had some differences.
Moreover, as they were separate scripts, nothing forced to keep the
outputs in sync (to re-generate them at the same time from the same
inputs).

To fix these maintainability issues, this patch
- merges the two python files and part of the 3rd utility module
  into a single script while keeping the existing functionality,
- names the new file `gen-unicode.py` to align better with other
  generator script in `tools`, and
- adds some extra documentation how to retrieve the input files
  (as they are not part of the repository).

The refactoring affected the utility module as well, so this patch
also
- renames `c_source_helper.py` to `gen_c_source.py` (again, for
  naming consistency),
- reorganizes some of its functions not to export module-local
  helper functions, and
- adapts `js2c.py`, as it also uses this utility module.

Additionally, the pyton script encodes the host:port address
information of the debug server in the file url and the HTML client
is extended to retrieve this information. Thus, both the console
and the browser-based debugger client can be started similarly.

All public headers should follow the pattern `jerryscript[-*].h`.
The `jerry-api.h` to `jerryscript.h` renaming has already happened
a while ago, now it's time for the port API header to follow.

This patch
* renames the public header file,
* updates all includes to use the new file name (in `jerry-main`,
  in all the targets, and in the docs), and
* keeps `jerry-port.h` as a deprecated forwarding header to leave
  some time for external users to follow up with this change.

As a related change, the header of the default port implementation
is also changed to `jerryscript-port-default.h`.

Currently, `lit-magic-strings.inc.h` is manually maintained. This
has several drawbacks:

- keeping the list of magic strings sorted first by length then
  alphabetically is error prone,
- it is easy to leave unused magic strings in the list by accident
  (e.g., `LIT_MAGIC_STRING_JERRY_UL` is defined as a magic string
  but not used anywhere in the code) and,
- it is very hard to add `CONFIG_DISABLE_*_BUILTIN` guards to the
  list, even though there are several magic strings, which are used
  in some of the configurations only (e.g, ""setPrototypeOf"" is used
  in ES2015 only).

To ease the maintenance of magic strings, this commit moves the
definition of magic strings to a config file
(`lit-magic-strings.ini`), and adds `tools/gen-magic-strings.py` to
generate the `.inc.h` file from this config file and from the use
cases of the strings in the code.

- The magic strings in the config file can appear in any order, the
  generator will ensure that they are correctly sorted.
- The generator skips those definitions that are not used anywhere
  (and emits a warning to signal that such definitions can be
  removed).
- The generator applies the same guards to the definitions in the
  `.inc.h` file as found in the code around the use of the strings
  to optimize for size.

The commit also changes some builtin-related `.inc.h` files by
adding guards that don't affect functionality but improve the
results of the generator.

To ensure that the invocation of the generator does not get
forgotten, the commit also adds `tools/check-magic-strings.sh` and
binds it into the testing infrastructure.

This modification makes it possible to initialize a context in such a
way that a `void *` pointer is stored inside the context and is made
available via a new `jerry_get_user_context()` API.

The pointer is initialized via a new `jerry_init_with_user_context()`
API, which calls the existing `jerry_init()`, after which it sets the
value of the new `user_context` element in the `jerry_context_t`
structure using the context allocation callback provided as the second
parameter to the new `jerry_init_with_user_context()` API. The location
of the cleanup function responsible for deallocating the pointer created
by the context allocation callback is provided as the third parameter.
This location is stored in the context along with the pointer itself.

When a context is discarded via `jerry_cleanup()`, the user context
cleanup function is called to dispose of the pointer stored within the
context.

The semantics behind the API are such that it is now possible to choose
for each context an agent which manages arbitrary user data keyed to the
given context. The agent must be chosen at context instantiation time
and cannot be changed afterwards, remaining in effect for the lifetime
of the context.

`Object.prototype.__proto__` has been implemented by most JS
engines to give R/W access to prototype chains, well before it made
it into the standard. JerryScript has decided not to implement it,
exactly because it was not part of ES 5.1. The only fully
ES5.1-compatible way of accessing the prototype chain is
`Object.getPrototypeOf` for reading.

However, ES2015 defines `Object.setPrototypeOf` for rewriting the
prototype chain, and JerryScript has now an ES2015 subset profile.
So, this commit adds its implementation to JerryScript.

Note, this commit does _not_ add `Object.prototype.__proto__`,
since that is in the Annex B of ES2015 specification, which is
optional for non-web-browser hosts.

Legacy implementation made incorrect assumptions on how many bits
of useful information is returned by libc's `rand()`. If `RAND_MAX`
had more than 16 useful bits, it assumed that `rand()` could return
32 useful random bits. However, e.g., jerry-libc's `RAND_MAX` is
`0x7fffffff`, which denotes 31 useful bits only. The consequence
was that `Math.random()` covered only the lower half of the
standard-mandated `[0,1)` interval.

This path fixes the error and always uses the exact value of
`RAND_MAX` to compute the random value, which will thus fully cover
`[0,1)`.

Instead of allocating a helper object, argument names are appended right
after the arguments objects. This reduces memory consumption and improve

might increase memory consumption in a few corner cases.

Although both jerry-libc and jerry-libm have configuration options
that enable/disable their build, in practice, only jerry-libc can be
replaced with the system (compiler-default) libc. If jerry-libm is
disabled, the build of jerry-main fails, as there is no way to
instruct the linker to link the system libm to the binary. (The
build system does have a way to pass flags to the linker, but those
flags are listed before the linked objects. For the references to
get resolved correctly, the libraries to be linked have to be
specified _after_ the objects.)

This patch adds the EXTERNAL_LINK_LIBS configuration option to
CMakeLists, which ensures that the specified libraries get
correctly passed to the linker. (E.g, replacing jerry-libm with
system libm becomes possible with
`JERRY_LIBM=OFF EXTERNAL_LINK_LIBS='-lm'`.)

Additionally, the patch also makes the following related changes:

* Removes the COMPILER_DEFAULT_LIBC configuration option, as it is
  (almost) always the opposite of JERRY_LIBC. Moreover, its name is
  misleading: its only role is to add `-nostdlib` to the linker
  flags.

* Makes use of transitive library dependencies: if a library has
  another library as dependency, and it is linked to a binary, its
  dependency is linked as well. Thus, jerry-libc, jerry-libm, and
  any external libraries are added to jerry-core as dependency, and
  then only jerry-core is linked to executables (cmake will take
  care of the rest).

* build.py and run-tests.py follow up the changes, along with some
  minor syntax changes.

* Moves static linking option to global CMakeLists, as unit test
  binaries should be linked the same way as jerry-main.

* Adds EXTERNAL_COMPILER_FLAGS and EXTERNAL_LINKER_FLAGS as last to
  the flag list, to allow user override of (nearly) anything.

The patch speculatively follows up the build system changes in the
mbed, riot-stm32f4, and zephyr targets.

`tools/build.py --help` prints a lot of output, which is sometimes
hard to comprehend, especially since some described options are
useful for developers only.

This patch:
* shortens how options are displayed in the output with the help of
  the ""metavar"" feature of the argparse module (""--option {on, off}""
  becomes ""--option X"" and the choices are listed in the description
  only); and
* hides all developer-specific options from ""--help"", and reveals
  them only for ""--devhelp"".

As a result, help output becomes more readable, especially for
ordinary users, and needs less space.

Some additional changes:
* the options are ordered in a more logical way (although that's
  somewhat subjective);
* help strings start with lowercase letters (it aligns better with
  argparse's overall style); and
* rename ""--cpointer_32_bit"" to ""--cpointer-32bit"" (underscores are
  alien to command line options).

Previously, jerry-core was built with various build identification
info (build date, git commit hash, git branch name), which was both
available from string constants of the library and also exposed by
jerry-main via the `--version` command line option. As of late,
jerry-core identifies itself only with API version number macros,
but sometimes it could be helpful to get access to the git commit
hash as well, even if that info does not become part of the API.

This patch moves the git commit hash retrieval logic from the build
scripts of jerry-core to jerry-main, and changes `--version` handler
to print the hash as well.

OS X build regularly reports some 39 warnings falling in 3 major
categories:

* ""static function '...' is used in an inline function with
  external linkage [-Wstatic-in-inline]"": Some semantics around
  `inline` have changed between C89 and C99, and gcc and clang seem
  to disagree on how strict they should be about them. Solution
  chosen is to use `-Wnostatic-in-inline` command line option for
  clang.

* ""implicit conversion turns floating-point number into integer:
  'double' to 'bool' [-Wfloat-conversion]"": `if (fmod (..., ...))`
  was used at different places, which is not nice anyway, thus the
  return value is compared explicitly against `ECMA_NUMBER_ZERO`.

* ""format string is not a string literal [-Wformat-nonliteral]"":
  Console and log port I/O functions have a printf-like interface,
  and the default implementations actually pass both format string
  and the remaining arguments to a vfprintf. However, clang is
  strict about the format string parameter of vfprintf and expects
  a literal there. By annotating the port I/O functions with
  `__attribute__ ((format (printf, ..., ...)))`, clang will check
  the format string being a literal string earlier, when the port
  functions are called, and will not complain within them when
  vfprintf is called.
  (Actually, this has revealed an incorrect format string, which
  has been fixed as well.)

(There were also some single conversion errors not listed above.)

The patch was tested on OS X (where all warnings disappeared), but
it should help clang compilation on other OS's as well.

The original implementation used shell facility, but it was designed for
a unix shell like input, and automatically tokenized it into
space-separated ""words"", with limit of 10 (i.e. 9 spaces per line). For
JavaScript input, it is quite easy to have more than 9 spaces per line,
and get error:

Too many parameters (max 10)

After consultation with upstream
(https://jira.zephyrproject.org/browse/ZEP-532) it was decided that the
best approach is to skip using shell facility and use Zephyr console
facility. That however requires some Zephyr-specific boilerplate code.
This code was implemented as reusable modules in
https://github.com/pfalcon/zephyr_console_helpers repository, to be
usable for other console-based projects too. zephyr_getline.h/c in this
commits are direct imports from this repository.

Apple does not support staticaly built applications on OSX, and all
dynamically built apps have to be linked against the System lib
(i.e., `-static` should not be used and `-lSystem` is a must).
As System contains all libc and libm functions, building (and
linking) the minimal jerry-libc and jerry-libm libs makes no sense.
Moreover, if JERRY_LIBC is ON, the compiler will use the jerry-libc
headers but will link the libc functions from System, which causes
heavy confusion and segfaults at run time.

Thus, this patch changes the build system to disable the building
of jerry-libc and jerry-libm, and enables the use of system
libraries when building on OSX.

* Ensures that all calls to `jerry_port_log` in jerry-core happen

  pattern that was well aligned with the naming scheme of the log
  level enum, `JERRY_DLOG` and `JERRY_DDLOG` were rewritten to
  `JERRY_DEBUG_MSG` and `JERRY_TRACE_MSG`.
* Ensures that all debug logging code parts of jerry-core (i.e.,
  memory statistics, JS byte-code dumps, and RegExp byte-code
  dumps) are guarded by macros: `JMEM_STATS`,
  `PARSER_DUMP_BYTE_CODE`, and `REGEXP_DUMP_BYTE_CODE`, which in
  turn are controled by cmake build system feature flags
  `FEATURE_MEM_STATS`, `FEATURE_PARSER_DUMP`, and
  `FEATURE_REGEXP_DUMP`.
* Ensures that all debug logging functionalities can be controled
  during run time (provided that they were enabled during build
  time): the engine has `JERRY_INIT_MEM_STATS[_SEPARATE]`,
  `JERRY_INIT_SHOW_OPCODES`, `JERRY_INIT_SHOW_REGEXP_OPCODES` init
  flags, and the default unix/linux command line app has
  corresponding command line switches.`
* Drops `FEATURE_LOG`, `JERRY_ENABLE_LOG`, and
  `JERRY_INIT_ENABLE_LOG`, as their name was misleadingly general,
  even though they mostly controled the regexp engine only. The
  above-mentioned `*REGEXP*` things mostly act as their
  replacements.

The `cmake` directory already contains several toolchain files for
various platforms (operating system + architecture). However,
`tools/build.py` does not define a toolchain file for cmake unless
explicitly specified. This patch changes the script to look into
the `cmake` directory for a file named
`toolchain_$(os)_$(arch).cmake` and, if found, pass that to cmake
by default.

OS and arch are determined by `os.uname()`. As Linux on Raspberry
Pi identifies itself as ""armv7l"", the legacy ""armv7l-hf"" arch name
is shortened to ""armv7l"". This way, building jerry on RPi
(natively, not cross) becomes possible by simply running
`tools/build.py` without any extra options.

Until now, jerry had 3 different assert-like routines:
`jerry_assert_fail`, `jerry_unreachable`, and `jerry_unimplemented`,
and 3 corresponding macros (`JERRY_ASSERT`, `JERRY_UNREACHABLE`,
and `JERRY_UNIMPLEMENTED`). They had some irregularities, namely:

* All of them had a string parameter, although `jerry_unreachable`
  never got anything there but NULL.
* Both `jerry_unreachable` and `jerry_unimplemented` checked its
  string parameter for NULL, although it was always NULL for the
  first one and never NULL for the second.
* `jerry_unreachable` is just a regular assert with a fixed error
  message (i.e., control should not have got here), however, the
  expansion of its corresponding macro in debug and release modes
  differs from the behaviour of `JERRY_ASSERT`: `JERRY_ASSERT` is
  a no-op in release, however, `JERRY_UNREACHABLE` was triggering
  a crash even there.
* Moreover, `JERRY_UNIMPLEMENTED` was almost never used anymore but
  in a few places (where often an `#ifdef` selected between
  `JERRY_UNIMPLEMENTED` and `JERRY_UNREACHABLE`).

Because of the above, this patch makes the following changes:

* Drops `JERRY_UNIMPLEMENTED` completely and whereever it was still
  used, replaces it with `JERRY_UNREACHABLE`. As a consequence, the
  `jerry_unimplemented` function and the `ERR_UNIMPLEMENTED_CASE`
  fatal error code are also removed.
* Makes `JERRY_UNREACHABLE` expand to no-op in release builds.
  (Actually, to `__builtin_unreachable ()` to avoid warnings.) As
  a consequence, makes both `jerry_assert_fail` and
  `jerry_unreachable` be guarded by `#ifndef JERRY_NDEBUG`. Also,
  changes `jerry_unreachable` not to expect a string parameter.
* Rewrites `TEST_ASSERT` not to rely on `jerry_assert_fail` as
  `TEST_ASSERT` has to work in release builds as well. This also
  allows changing the error message not to mention ""ICE"", which
  would misleadingly suggest an assert within the engine, but
  ""TEST"" instead.

As a side-effect of the cleanup, some refactorings happened in
jrt.h:

* Removed the definition of the unnecessary `__extension__` macro.
* Re-used `JERRY_UNUSED` and `unlikely` where possible.
* Moved some parts of the file around.
* Fixed some comments (`/**` should only be used for the docstring
  of a single entity, for groups header comments, the regular `/*`
  should be used).

With this change, REPL works almost the same as a standard JS REPL does
(browser console, Node.js, etc.). A result of each expression is
printed, e.g. ""2+2"" will print ""4"". Result is printed even if its
value is ""undefined"", e.g. ""print(1)"" will print ""1"", and on the next
line ""undefined"" (which is again how ""normal"" JS console work, except
a normal JS way to print to console is console.log()).

If an exception occured, a message ""Error executing statement:"", followed
by external representation of exception object, is printed. Note that
distinctive exception objects are supported only in ""cp"" (compact profile),
not in ""cp_minimal"". In the latter case, there's only exception hierarchy
top-level prototype, so any error message will look like:

(That's the reason why there's error message prefix - so it weren't too
confusing even if used in cp_minimal config. Unfortunately, compile-time
JerryScript configuration isn't available to Zephyr's main.c, so there's
no easy way to implement cp vs cp_minimal distinction).

Allocate a single memory block for strings, rather than a separate string header
and string characters block. In the past strings were split into 8 byte chunks,
and large amount of legacy code is designed for that representation. However the
current allocator allows block allocation so we don't need those complicated
algorithms anymore. This patch is a cleanup rather than an optimization.

Jerry (the command line tool) has been supporting the execution of
multiple script files for long. However, until now, it simply
concatenated all sources into a single source buffer and
parsed/executed them as one unit. Other JS execution tools (e.g.,
jsc, v8) load and execute separate files as separate units -- but
still in the same execution environment. The most significant
effect of this approach is that the `""use strict;""` directive (or
the absence of it) at the beginning of each JS script file takes
effect as expected (i.e., as if the script was executed alone).
Contrarily, the concatenation-based approach forces the strictness
of the first script on all the rest (i.e., if the first script
starts with `""use strict"";` the rest is also executed in a strict
environment even if they did not contain the directive, and vice
versa).

This patch makes the jerry command line tool to load/parse/run one
unit at a time.

Side effects:
- As there is no need for separate file read routines that load one
  file (a snapshot) or concat multiple (JS sources) anymore, those
  routines got merged.
- Both previous read routines used multiple stdio functions
  (`fseek`, `ftell`, and `rewind`). This has been simplified to
  rely on `fread` only to find out the length of the input.
- This simplification made the above mentioned functions
  superfluous in jerry-libc.
- As some error messages had to be touched in this patch, several
  more have been beautified to make them more consistent.
- One small change was needed in `jerry_parse` in jerry-core to
  allow subsequent parsing of multiple sources (without that, an
  assertion was triggered).

* Linux uses `__NR_xxx` mnemonics for syscall numbers, while darwin

* The linux target has a commented out `jrt_set_mem_limits` fuction

Simple preprocessor macros can unify the first three differences.
While for the sake of legacy, we can keep the fourth commented-out
code in the code base; it might turn out to be useful elsewhere in
the future. Since it remains commented out it wont cause any
problems on any OSs.

MEM_HEAP_PTR_64 is duplicating existing information: stdint.h, which
header is already used by the project, defines various _MAX macros
for upper limits of integer types. The comparison of UINTPTR_MAX and
UINT32_MAX can give the same info as encoded in MEM_HEAP_PTR_64.
The stdint.h-based approach has the benefit that jerry can support
any 64-bit architecture without the need for editing the build
system. (With the existing approach, CMakeLists has to know about
every 64-bit architecture to work properly.)

Thus, removing the extraneous macro from the code.

The patch also changes the mem_pools_chunk_t struct, as it turned
out that the struct does not have to be padded to MEM_POOL_CHUNK_SIZE.
(The padding also depended on MEM_HEAP_PTR_64.) It is enough if the
size of the struct is smaller than (or equal to) MEM_POOL_CHUNK_SIZE.

The project is relying on a variant of fdlibm, which has aleady
been edited but never verified for correctness. This patch adds
unit testing of fdlibm by:

* introducing a test generator that uses a trusted libm
  implementation to calculate correct and expected results of math
  functions
  (tools/gen-test-fdlibm.sh and tools/unit-tests/gen-test-fdlibm.c),
* adding tests created with the generator that stress all publicly
  exported functions of jerry's fdlibm
  (tests/unit/test-fdlibm.inc.h), and
* adding a unit test file to drive the generated tests
  (tests/unit/test-fdlibm.c).

Note: The test generator is not expected to be executed often, thus
it is not wired into the build system. If it gets edited, it must
be used locally to re-generate the .inc.h file.

During development, it turned out that tests/unit/test-common.h
included the system header math.h, which was only a bad smell until
now but became a real header conflict issue with the introduction
of the fdlibm unit test. Thus, this patch also changes the include
to fdlibm-math.h.

* Fix ""end of file while inside a group"" doxygen warnings.

* Fix ""unknown command"" doxygen warnings caused by incorrect
  argument references. Instead of `@foo`, `@a foo` is the proper
  format.

* Fix ""unknown command"" doxygen warnings caused by incorrect
  parameter direction specifications. Instead of `@in`, `@out`,
  and `@in-out`, `[in]`, `[out]`, and `[in,out]` are the proper
  formats.

* Wrapping special characters in quotes to avoid doxygen
  confusion. Raw pipe, semicolon, dot, backslash, etc. characters
  can drive doxygen into various misinterpretations and warnings.
  E.g.:
  ```
  End of list marker found without any preceding list items
  Found unknown command
  ```
  Putting quotes around such text snipets eliminates the errors.

* Fix the documentation of `ecma_builtin_global_object_print`. Raw
  <> and \ sequences confused doxygen in various ways (it tried to
  interpret them as XML tags and doxygen commands).

* Fix ""ignoring title that does not match old title"" doxygen
  warnings. At some places, the group titles were out of sync, at
  others, the group names were incorrect.

* Fix ""parameters are not documented"" doxygen warnings. Fixing
  various typos in the inline parameter documentations (`/*`,
  `/**`, `/** <`, and `/**>` are all considered incorrect, the
  right format is `/**<`).

* Updated leading documentation comments (they were somewhat
  stale).
* Tried to keep the target names exactly the same as they were --
  almost succeeded... (some changes are intentional, and are
  subject to personal preferences).
* Simplified console output of `make precommit`
* Unified test runner scripts and their output format
  * Eliminated nothing-to-stdout everything-to-log-file policy:
    info is printed to stdout and it is the caller's
    responsibility to redirect it to a file if needed.
  * Also applied some renaming and coding style unification to
    the scripts.
* Merged the functionality of tools/runners/run-test-suite-jerry*.sh
  into the Makefile
* Merged everything related to a test suite execution in a single
  script.
  * The new script also allows to specify pass and xfail tests in
    a single list file, which was not possible hitherto.

When linking a release-built command line shell on Linux against
default glibc with LTO enabled, a long-open gcc bug causes spurious
warning to be emitted around a call to fread. The `-Werror` flag
turns this into an error and the build process fails.
Unfortunately, there is no way to selectively disable the warning
with pragmas or `-Wno-error=xxx` flags.

Thus, this patch introduces some helper macros and lists all
warnings explicitly with `-Werror=xxx` instead of covering all
warnings with the `-Werror` flag. This way, warnings enabled by
command line flags do cause errors, but those raised by warning
attributes (which cannot be suppressed by any `-Wno-error=xxx`
flags) don't.

The current code base does not contain any ""first JavaScript
program"" for those who build JerryScript for Linux console. It
does contain a LED-blinking example -- blinky.js -- but that's
only useful on an developer board where LEDs-to-be-blinked are
available. And the rest of the tests are just that: tests, giving
passed/failed information but nothing eye candy.

This patch adds a simple JS script that can act as a warm welcome
to anyone after the first successful build trying to run something
proving that Jerry works.

Added declaration and implementations of `void abort (void)` to
jerry-libc. As the linux implementation relies on the `getpid`
syscall - which has no arguments - `syscall_0` implementations
have been added as well.

`libc_fatal` has been adapted to use the new `abort` function
instead of `exit`. This also made the definition of
`LIBC_FATAL_ERROR_EXIT_CODE` unnecessary.

Finally, the syscall fatal error message was fixed.
