though they are executed by the interpreter at compile time as there is
no syntactical difference. It's therefore a little bit different
situation than with preprocessor macros of other languages, which tend
to differ from normal runtime code."

* [Perl] Add array item access

This commit adds support to scope the item access of an array.

Examples:
  $array[0][2]
  $dict{'key1'}{'key2'}

This change is required to properly highlight those expressions in
string interpolations. Otherwise the array index would not be part of
the interpolation.

It turned out an array is initialized with the following expression:

  $array = [ item1, item2, ...];

This commit adds the ""brackets"" contexts with rules to scope the
opening and closing brackets.

Note:

  1. The `groups-nested` is not added everywhere to reduce the risk of
     interfering with HEREDOCs. It is assumed no one decides to define
     a HEREDOC within an array item access expression.
  2. The `groups-nested` was not yet used and contained a therefore
     unrevealed issue, which is fixed as well. It used the wrong match
     patterns. `{` instead of `(`.

Fixes #1941

Issue Description

  A quotation mark found in the arguments of a function-call causes
  the parser to push into the quoted-string context. The region up to
  the next quotation mark is then scoped as quoted string.

  But make interprets single quotation marks in functions like `subst`
  as ordinary characters.

  The following escapes all quotation marks in $1:

    $(subst "",\"", $1)

Solution Proposal

  This commit proposes to just eat escaped quotation marks (\"", \')
  or those followed by the arguments separator.

  They are scoped as whatever the parent context scopes the current
  region. The example posted in issue #1941 causes the quotation marks
  to be scoped as `string.unquoted`."

* [ShellScript] Rename control flow keywords

This commit...

1. renames all control flow keywords to comply with
   https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/issues/1228

2. renames the ""case"" contexts to comply with sematics of
   https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html

   Each case branch consists of a `pattern` and a `clause`, which is
   executed if the `pattern` matches the `word`.

* [ShellScript] Fix case context stacking

This commit fixes a design issue of the case context, which could probably cause the parser to hit a sanity limit if a file with too many case clauses was loaded.

Instead of chaining each case clause via `set` keyword until `esac` is matched, a common `case-body` context is introduced from which each pattern/command-list pair is pushed. This results in at most two contexts to be pushed to the scope stack no matter how many clauses the case statement contains.

* [ShellScript] Fix keyword boundary lookahead

This commit adds a `keyword_boundary_char` and reuses it in the `keyword_boundary_end` variable.

Notes:

- The `_` is removed as it is part of \w
- The negative lookahead `(?!=)` is merged with `[^\w_-]`
  with the assumption that a keyword is not matched as such
  if followed by a `=` or `-`.
- The `$` is removed because `[^-=\w]` seems sufficient to
  match a word boundary

As a result the new variables can be used for the keywords in the recently refactored `case` statement to harden keyword matching.

* [ShellScript] Rename 'keyword_boundary_end' to 'keyword_break'

Inspired by other syntax definitions such as JavaScript this commit renames the 'keyword_boundary_end' to 'keyword_break'.

This change has no functional effects.

* [ShellScript] Fix wrong indention

This commit fixes a lint issue with an under-indented context list by turning it into an array, which was chosen as the number of contexts and the length of the names is short enough to look well.

* [ShellScript] Address requested review changes

1. The `keyword_break` is turned into a negative lookahead to make
   it work properly at the eof without breaking its function in
   other situations.

   Note: Adding `$` would have broken the syntax definition.

2. The keyword `elif` is scoped with the standardized `elseif`
   sub scope.

3. The keyword `done` is scoped as `... loop.end` as it finalizes
   a for loop. This scope now matches the conditional statements,
   which use `keyword.control.conditional.end` already.

* [ShellScript] Fix 'esac' highlighting in incomplete case statement

This commit fixes an issue which caused the the `esac` keyword not to be matched if the `in` keyword is missing.

During fixing the first issue it turned out the `keyword_break` variable can be used in the `case-end-ahead` context as negative lookaheads work well in positive ones.

* [ShellScript] Highlight stray `esac` as keyword like stray `fi`.

If the leading `case` keyword is missing or incomplete, the finalizing `esac` should be scoped as keyword as well.

This commit does not scope it as illegal as it is not yet implemented for `fi` as well. The syntax does not handle many illegals at all, so this commit does not intend to change that.

* [ShellScript] Fix meta.conditional.case boundaries

This commit ensures to add the meta scope to the `esac` keyword only if it finalizes a valid `case` statement.

* [ShellScript] Fix then keyword_break

This commit applies the {{keyword_break}} lookahead to the `then`
keyword in order to not scope `then-` and friends as such.

* [ShellScript] Fix highlighting of ! after logical operator

Fixes #1868
Fixes #1871

* [ShellScript] Simplify cmd-post context

This commit simplifies the `cmd-post` context by:

1. removing the `meta.post-cmd.shell` which seems to have no
   function and is not part of any completion or test
2. removing the initial `set` command which is no longer needed
   due to removing the meta scope
3. removing some once-used variables which seem to create more
   confusion then improve readability
4. removing capture groups to improve parsing performance as ST
   is known to win about 12-15% by not using `caputure:`

* [ShellScript] Fix `!` operator

This commit fixes a regression with not highlighting `!` as operator
at the beginning of a line.

According to http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html#NOTREF

`!` followed by a space => keyword
`!` not followed by a space => triggers shell history function

This rule is applied to ShellScript now.

* [ShellScript] Fix `!` at end of file

This commit applies a requested change from review which fixes
the issue of not matching `!` as keyword.operator.logical, if
it is followed by the end of file.

* [ShellScript] Remove obsolete lookahead

The lookahead in the second `!` match is not needed.

Also add some tests to ensure we don't break with line continuation.

* [ShellScript] Add support for shell history references

According to @FichteFoll's comment and a description at (1)
the shell supports `!!`, `!-<n>` and `!<n>` to access commands
from the shell's history.

This commit scopes these tokens as `variable.language`.

* [XML] Refactor syntax test test case comments

This commit introduces `##` as punctuation for syntax test cases
and adds a prototype context to the XML.sublime-syntax file which
can be commented in or out in order to highlight these comments as
such or ignore them.

The main goal is to introduce a comment style which is independent
from valid XML style comments as those might break otherwise valid
xml code when added in certain places for testing.

Example:

  XML comments are not valid within xml tags. In order to check,
  whether xml tags work perfectly if spanning multiple lines,
  test cases must be added within tags, which would then break them.

The `##` is choosen as it is used by the HTML.sublime-syntax as well.

Note:
  The `protoype` context should be commented out before committing!

* [XML] Resort contexts

This commit adds some gaps between the contexts and moves
the string and entity contexts to the bottom of the file.

* [XML] Use entities from HTML syntax

This commit applies the entities context from HTML.

Remarks:

1. The `entity` section is not renamed to `entities` as
   a) all other xml contexts use singular spelling as well
   b) PackageDev uses the `entity` context.

2. The `;` is scoped as `punctuation.terminator` instead of
   `punctuation.definition`.

* [XML] Rename contexts according to HTML

The contexts are renamed according to HTML but kept in singular form.

It does not provide any functional changes.

* [XML] Create context for DOCTYPE

This commit moves the lexer rule for <!DOCTYPE...> tags into
a separate context.

This is part of the modularization of the whole syntax definition.

It does not provide any functional changes.

* [XML] Create context for CDATA

This commit moves the lexer rule for <![CDATA[...]]> tags into
a separate context.

This is part of the modularization of the whole syntax definition.

It does not provide any functional changes.

* [XML] Create context for preprocessor

This commit moves the lexer rule for <?xml ... ?> tags into
a separate context.

This is part of the modularization of the whole syntax definition.

It does not provide any functional changes.

* [XML] Create context for generic xml tags

This commit moves the lexer rule for <tag> ... </tag> tags into
a separate context.

This is part of the modularization of the whole syntax definition.

It does not provide any functional changes.

* [XML] Refactor preprocessor context

This commit introduces the following functional changes

1. Accept all lowercase <?xml-foo-bar-baz ... ?> as valid prolog tags.
   The currently available prologs are:

        <?xml ...?>
        <?xml-model ...?>
        <?xml-stylesheet ...?>

   This change was made to keep the syntax definition future proof and
   avoid issues with changes or extensions to the xml specification.

2. Highlight mixed- or uppercase tag names invalid, but handle the rest
   of the prolog tag normally instead of breaking their whole syntax
   highlighting because of the none well-formed tag name.

3. Create a dedicated `preprocessor-end` context to avoid duplication.

4. Add a couple of syntax test cases

* [XML] Refactor generic xml tag context

This commit introduces the following functional changes:

1. Opening and closing tags are handled separately in order to
   a) disallow attributes in closing tags
   b) disallow `/>` in closing tags

2. Highlight invalid `namespace` and `localname` parts more
   precisely to match real worlds xml processor behavior.

   In a tag name like `ns:t:ag` the `ns:` is parsed as valid
   namespace, but the the whole `t:ag` is parsed as none
   well-formed localname.

* [XML] Refactor tag attribute context

This commit introduces the following functional changes:

1. Highlight invalid `namespace` and `localname` parts more
   precisely to match real worlds xml processor behavior.

   In an attribute name like `ns:a:ttr` the `ns:` is parsed as valid
   namespace, but the the whole `a:ttr` is parsed as none
   well-formed localname.

2. Incomplete attribute names like `ns:` are not highlighted illegal
   in order to improve writing experience. It is a valid namespace
   part of an attribute name.

3. Enable attributes to span multiple lines, which is valid xml
   syntax but was not yet handled well by the XML.sublime-syntax

* [XML] Move invalid comments tests

As more complex tests result in invalid highlighting tests
to be part of the normal test cases, the illegal comment tests
are moved to the comments section.

* [XML] Fix broken highlighting after incomplete tags/attributes

The main goal of this commit is to improve user experience while
writing XML documents by not breaking the highlighting of content
which follows incomplete tags or attributes.

It adds an `tag-end-missing-pop` context, which is used to pop off
from a tag even though it is not yet closed, as soon as the next
opening tag punctuation `<` is detected.

As a hint the preceding whitespace before `<` is highlighted as
`invalid.illegal` without breaking the rest of the document.

A couple of test cases are added illustrating the new behavior.

* [XML] Refactor CDATA context

This commit introduces the following functional changes:

1. Scope the `<![CDTATA[` and `]]>` as xml tag instead of string.
2. Only the content of the CDATA is scoped as string.
3. Add some test cases.

* [XML] Refactor DOCTYPE context

This comment introduces the following functional changes:

1. Disallow lower case <!doctype .. > tags as they are not well-formed.
2. More accurate highlighting of DOCTYPE attributes according to DTD specs.
   - highlight PUBLIC and SYSTEM keywords
   - enforce order: root-name, type, content
3. Rename all dtd contexts to start with ""dtd-""
4. Introduce an `dtd-end` context to reduce duplicated
   `punctuation.definition.tag.end` definitions
5. Add some test cases

Note:

  In order to make test cases work it is required to comment in
  the `prototype:` context!

  There is no simpler way to create test case comments which do not interfere
  with the syntax itself - especially with tags spanning multiple lines.

* [XML] Rename declaration contexts

This commit renames the declaration contexts to tell the reader they
belong to doctype definitions.

* [XML] Refactor DTD ENTITY definitions

This commit introduces the following functional changes:

1. support multi-line entity definitions
2. qualify entity name
3. be permissive with incomplete definitions/statements
4. follow scope name guidelines
   -> keyword.entity => keyword.declaration.entity
   -> keyword.entitytype => storage.type.external-content
   -> variable.entity => variable.other.entity
5. scope the whole <!ENTITY ... > with `meta.tag.sgml.entity`
6. add a couple of test cases

* [XML] Refactor DTD ELEMENT definitions

This commit introduces the following functional changes:

1. support multi-line element definitions
2. qualify element name
3. be permissive with incomplete definitions/statements
4. follow scope name guidelines
   -> keyword.element => keyword.declaration.element
   -> variable.element => variable.other.element
5. scope the whole <!ELEMENT ... > with `meta.tag.sgml.element`
6. improve content highlighting
7. add a couple of test cases

* [XML] Refactor DTD ATTLIST definitions

This commit introduces the following functional changes:

1. support multi-line attribute list definitions
2. qualify attribute list name
3. include more keywords
4. be permissive with incomplete definitions/statements
5. follow scope name guidelines
   -> keyword.attlist => keyword.declaration.attlist
   -> variable.element => variable.other.element
6. scope the whole <!ATTLIST ... > with `meta.tag.sgml.attlist
7. add a couple of test cases

* [XML] Refactor DTD NOTATION definitions

This commit introduces the following functional changes:

1. support multi-line notation definitions
2. qualify notation name
3. include PUBLIC/SYSTEM keywords
4. be permissive with incomplete definitions/statements
5. follow scope name guidelines
   -> keyword.notation => keyword.declaration.notation
   -> variable.notation => variable.other.notation
6. scope the whole <!NOTATION ... > with `meta.tag.sgml.notation`
7. add a couple of test cases

* [XML] Add DTD subset definition

This commit adds support for recursive internal subsets in DTDs.

The DITA-1.3 standard makes use of such statements for example.

* [XML] Add UNKNOWN declaration context

This context is meant to catch all unknown or illegal declarations
without breaking highlighting of the rest of the document.

* [XML] Fix entity identifier

This commit uses the `identifier` variable to match named entities.
Entities may contain `-`, `_` or `.` which was found by reading through
some valid DTD files of the DITA standard.

It also adds a test to ensure DTD are not matched outside the DOCTYPE.

* [XML] Remove incompatible test cases

Some of the test cases would require the `##` test case comments to be
excluded from tokenizing by commenting in the `prototype` context or by
the core itself.

This commit removes such test cases as they break the CI tests on github.

* [XML] Update snippets

- rename all snippets to start with `xml-`
- fix an issue with invalid tabTriggers for `long-tag` and `short-tag`
- remove comment snippet as it can be added via key binding
- add snippets for some basic xml tags like:

    <xml-model />
    <xml-stylesheet />

- rename the `XML-Processing-Instruction` to `xml-declaration` as the
  first line of the xml document is NOT an processing instruction even
  though it uses the same syntax.

  See Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_Instruction):

  The XML Declaration at the beginning of an XML document (shown below) is not a processing instruction, however its similar syntax has often resulted in it being referred to as a processing instruction.[5]

* [XML] Remove stray CDATA punctuation

see #1786

* [XML] Add .rng file extension

rng files are a kind of xml based scheme."

* [Perl] Distinguish function/variable class members

Issue #1902 was introduced by commit 8726418 and is triggered by not correctly distinguishing function and variable members of classes or objects.

This commit therefore starts with member matching of classes as a first step to fix issue #1902.

* [Perl] Fix predefined sub-routines

This commit moves the keywords `AUTOLOAD` etc. out of the functions context to the `sub` context as these names describe special sub routines a user can define as callback to be called by perl in certain situations.

This step is not crucial to fix issue #1902, but is found worth doing while investigating for further steps to fix the main issue.

* [Perl] Fix user defined sub-routines

The issue #1902 is triggered by recognizing a member value of an object as member function, while user defined functions were assumed to be called with the same syntax as builtins.

But while arguments of builtin functions like `print`, `say`, etc. don't need to be surrounded by parentheses, the ones of user defined sub routines must be.

Examples:

  Valid builtin function call:

    print <Hello World>

  Valid user defined sub routine call:

    sub myprint(@arg) { print @arg; }

    myprint(<Hello World>);

This commit makes sure to match a token as user defined function call only if the identifier is followed by parentheses and adds `meta.function-call` scopes as the parentheses make it easy to find the arguments boundaries.

It does not add `meta.function-call` scopes to builtin function calls. Due to some limitations with regards of pushing into contexts which are required to handle HEREDOCS correctly it is not possible to find the end of an argument list reliably.

* [Perl] Distinguish function/variable object members

This commit is the final step to fix issue #1902.

It changes the `->` token from `keyword.operator` to `keyword.accessor` and introduces distinguishing object variable and function members, because the most recent commit caused a token like `->value` to not be scoped at all anymore.

The Perl syntax now scopes `->value` as `variable.other.member`  and `->func()` as `variable.function.member` as it was introduced for class members a couple of commits before."

* [Perl] Allow any kind of whitespace around accessors

The accessor `::` may be surrounded by spaces and tabs. Not sure whether
someone makes use of tabs in such situations, but it should not fail if
one decides to do so.

HEREDOC indention still accepts normal spaces only at the moment as the
amount of spaces in front of the starting and terminating keyword must be
the same which might be tricky to handle if mixed indention is used.

* [Perl] Remove an isolated regexp flag

Inspired by PR #1640 this commit removes the isolated (?x) from
the `pragma` context.

Even though no related issues were found this style of flag is used
in the `functions` context already. So this change ensures the same
coding style to be used in both contexts."

Fixes #1492

Supersedes PR #1493

This PR is an alternative for #1493 as it seems to be stalled after @wbond's suggestion to handle <script type = ""text/html""> content as ordinary part of the html syntax itself instead of using the `embed` command.

The code suggested by this PR is very much the same as the one of #1493, but

1. replaces the `embed` part by ordinary includes.
2. adds some extra lines of syntax test to verify the correct stacking of scopes."

The ""source"" tag can be used to communicate the implementation of
Structural Elements by presenting their source code, or more typically -
portions of it.

If specified, the starting line MUST be a positive integer. Counting
starts at the line where the Structural Element's body started (i.e. the
line with the opening brace). This line number MAY optionally be
followed by another positive integer, specifying the number of lines to
present from the starting line onwards. If omitted, the Structural
Element's source is presented from the starting line, to its end (i.e.
the line with the closing brace).

If no starting line is specified, the Structural Element's source is
presented in its entirety. If no starting line is specified, the
Structural Element's source is presented in its entirety.

The ""property"" tag is used in the situation where a class contains the
`__get()` and `__set()` magic methods and allows for specific names.

An example of this is a child class whose parent has a `__get()`. The
child knows which properties need to be present but relies on the parent
class to use the `__get()` method to provide it. In this situation, the
child class would have a ""property"" tag for each magic property. The
""property"" tags MUST NOT be used in a PHPDoc that is not associated with
a class or interface.

The ""method"" tag is used in situation where a class contains the
`__call()` magic method and defines some definite uses.

An example of this is a child class whose parent has a `__call()` to
have dynamic getters or setters for predefined properties. The child
knows which getters and setters need to be present but relies on the
parent class to use the `__call()` method to provide it. In this
situation, the child class would have a ""method"" tag for each magic
setter or getter method.

The ""method"" tag allows the author to communicate the type of the
arguments and return value by including those types in the signature.
When the intended method does not have a return value then the return
type MAY be omitted; in which case `void` is implied. The ""method"" tags
MUST NOT be used in a PHPDoc that is not associated with a class or
interface.

The ""ignore"" tag tells phpDocumentor that the Structural Elements

be to prevent duplicate documenting of conditional constants. It is

stating why the associated element is to be ignored.

The ""filesource"" tag tells phpDocumentor to include the current file in
the parsing output. As this only applies to the source code of the
entire file MUST this tag be used in the file-level PHPDoc. Any other
location will be ignored. When this tag is included will phpDocumentor
compress the file contents and encode them using Base64 so that it can
be handled by the transformer. Any template that is able to show the
source code can then read the source sub-element in the associated file
element in the Abstract Syntax Tree.

- Highlight triple quoted strings
- Highlight ""dollar slashy strings""
- Highlight unclosed strings
- Highlight erroneous newlines in single line strings
- Highlight invalid identifiers in interpolated strings
- Highlight interpolation in slashy strings (""regexp"")
- Enable full language highlighting inside interpolation
- Only include the proper unicode ranges in identifiers (variables)
  inside string interpolation.
- Only match valid escape sequences (instead of any character at all);
  note that the different kinds of strings don't share all of the same
  escape sequences.
- Add a whole bunch of tests for strings

Note: Technically ""slashy strings"" (scoped as ""regexp"" here) allow
newlines as well, but I think more work needs to be done before
removing the lookahead expression on the opening '/'.

For instance, the following is already highlighted incorrectly and it
would probably lead to even more troubles if these were set free from
their current single line containment (without additional work).

```groovy
// Current (incorrect) highlighting
def a = 1 / 2 + / 3 /
//      ^ constant.numeric.groovy
//        ^^^^^^^ string.regexp.groovy
//                ^ constant.numeric.groovy
//                  ^ keyword.operator.arithmetic.groovy

// Correct highlighting

Prior to this commit the globally valid keyword @counter-style was
highlighted as `entity.name.tag.custom` if no style-name is provided
between it and the next `{`.

Even though the style-name is required the keyword must/should be
scoped correctly if it is missing in order to avoid confusion.

Therefore this commit marks the style-name as optional to fix scoping
of incomplete counter-style rules."

Most auto-completion packages provide basic information about their
suggestions as hints right next to each item, which distinguishes
auto-completion items very clearly from word-completions.

CSS disables word-completions, but it is not obvious to the end user.

Therefore this commit adds a hint to each returned completion item to
allow the end user to clearly see it is a valid value from a database
but not something ST might have caught from anywhere in the text."

Fixes https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/issues/626
Fixes https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/issues/190
Fixes https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/issues/46

Goodies
-------

* Proper context sensitive command invocations
* Variable expansion as from ShellScriptImproved
* Backtick handling as from ShellScriptImproved
* No with_prototype contexts
* Generic options handling
* Builtin-commands know their valid options
* Renamed Shell-Unix-Generic to bash, as it's really just bash (and dash)

About 1300 syntax tests, tested out in the wild with various bash scripts.

Deficiencies
------------

The heredocs handling is still not perfect, but it gets the job done if you
don't have a function definition, inline if-block or compound command on
the same line as the start of the heredoc token.

* It's easy to bring back the embedded language highlighting for particular
  heredoc tokens, but this is omitted for now.
* It's easy to embed the regex language for regex matching in if-blocks at
  this point.

Acknowledgements
----------------

* @jfcherng for starting ShellScriptImproved and the huge amount of syntax
  tests,
* @okdana for creating syntax tests,
* @fichtefoll for pointing me to the Ruby syntax for heredoc handling,
* @keith-hall, @wbond for their suggestions about scope names."

Some regex engines such as Oniguruma distinguish between `\x..` and
`\x{..}` in that the former matches bytes whereas the latter matches
Unicode code points, see here:

https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/blob/master/doc/RE#L26

The CSS syntax matches e.g. the U+00B7 character. So for that to work in
Oniguruma, it needs to be written as `\x{B7}`. For readability, this
change uses `\x{00B7}` which is closer to how Unicode characters are
commonly denoted."

Objective-C and Objective-C++ support the standard format specifiers
in format strings as well as an additional format code of `%@` which
designates the string representation of an object as determined by one
of its description methods.

This change adds in detection for this format specifier in object
strings and includes two new syntax tests to ensure that the specifier
is allowed in an NXConstantString but not in a standard C string
constant.

In my tests, this change to the Objective-C syntax is also applied to
files of type Objective-C++ with no further changes."

While reading some C++ headers (_cffi_include.h) I recently found some blocks
not being highlighted at all. Everything from the second `__cplusplus` to the
the final `}` keeps unhighlighted.

```C++
#include <Python.h>
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern ""C"" {
#endif

#ifdef __cplusplus       // THE LAST HIGHLIGHTED LINE
# ifndef _Bool
   typedef bool _Bool;   /* semi-hackish: C++ has no _Bool; bool is builtin */
# endif
#endif

#ifdef __cplusplus
}                        // HIGHLIGHTED AGAIN
#endif
```

With `#ifdef __cplusplus` within an `extern ""C"" {` block an empty scope is set
to stack causing this issue. This issue is fixed by removing this block at all.

So the `global` and `global-preprocessor` scopes are used within external C blocks
for highlighting."

""meta.generic-name"".

This change triggers the bug described in
https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1190, where the
most-inner context in a multi-push operation *must* match at least one
character before it can be popped.

Due this, the tests are currently *not* passing."

There remains a small ""issue"" if an unmatched closing brace exists while
in extended mode, where the extended mode state is lost.
This is because I push the base-group-extended scope even when we're in
global scope (i.e. use `(?x)` not within another group) since otherwise
things would become extremely messy.

However, stray closing braces are invalid regexps anyway, so this
shouldn't matter in practice.

A later commit will highlight these stray braces as invalid."

I found this while investigating all the scopes in the repo where order mattered and this was the only one. Turns out it is a mistake and this should match the one in the Ruby syntax file.

So fun fact: in all the default syntaxes order of the scope doesn't matter when checking equality. Not sure if this is true for all prefixes yet though."
