The deleted property previously wasn't defined as a bool, so setting it
to True or False ended up with the strings ""True"" or ""False"" being saved
to the backing CF. This meant that trying to explicitly set a client as
not deleted would only work if you set the value as an empty string (or
completely removed the property), since attempting to set it as False
would save a string that still evaluates as True in a boolean context.

As part of this change, I also ran a backfill script that went through
and converted all existing .deleted values in the database. Anything
with a value of ""True"" was converted to ""1"" (since that's the only value
that something defined in _bool_props will accept as True), and it just
removed the property from anything with empty strings as values.

In addition, this adds .deleted to OAuth2Client._defaults so that it's
not necessary to use getattr() all the time to access it."

If our format_number() and format_percent() wrappers (around the babel
functions) aren't passed a locale argument, they will use c.locale. But
in some cases, c.locale will return an empty string, which will then be
used when calling the babel functions. The locale-parsing in babel is
unable to handle an empty string, and will throw an exception.

This commit changes these wrappers slightly so that if c.locale is also
empty, the wrappers will instead call the babel functions without a
locale argument, which will cause it to default to the LC_NUMERIC
environment variable."

Deleted users are automatically removed from friends lists 90 days after
the account is deleted, but until that happens it's possible that their
posts will still show up in /r/friends. This will only occur if the
viewer has fewer friends than the limit used to build /r/friends, since
that causes a shortcut case that just returns all of their friends. If
they have more friends than the limit, the functions like
get_recently_submitted_friend_ids() will already filter out deleted/spam
users, but the shortcut doesn't do any filtering.

This commit adds similar filtering into the keep_fn() for
ListingController and CommentsController, which will filter out any
remaining posts by deleted/spam users at display-time. This was
preferable to just removing the shortcut and having all users query
for friends, since that query is fairly slow."

The standlone functions provide the tools needed to build the above
operations. They do not have any policy beyond the translation of their
use case to the underlying key-value store operations, so they are
valuable in unusual cases. The new RateLimit uses them to make the
probably-common case of ratelimits pulled from g.live_config simpler. It
provides check() and record_usage() operations.

that the info is being displayed in."

Normally, if a moderator leaves a top-level comment on a post and
distinguishes it, we send an orangered to the author of the post even if
they have ""send replies to my inbox"" disabled for that post. This is
done since a distinguished top-level comment is often used to give important
information to the author (such as why the post was removed).

However, since AutoMod distinguishes its comments ""directly"" by just
setting the attribute, this logic wasn't being checked for its comments,
and it hasn't been sending orangereds in cases where it should be. This
commit fixes that, and ensures that it'll always send one whenever it's

However, when doing this, we were previously calling queries.new_comment
to send the notification. There are multiple other unnecessary updates
done by this, which can result in strange errors like the comment
showing up twice in the subreddit's comments listing.

This commit changes to just call queries.update_comment_notifications

Using background threads causes annoying complications in general (like right
now if the worker thread is backed up but we restart the app we just lose the
work). But the particular problem at hand is that the permacache zlib patch
wants to do compression. That can cost a lot of CPU so we want to know how long
it takes which means that we need timers. But timers work by reading from
g.stats, and g isn't available in the background thread.

We could find some other way to do the timers, but I'd rather just stop using
the AMQP background thread for anything but actual AMQP stuff which will kill
both birds with one stone.

At a glance it looks like this would cost us roughly 25ms per update to these
listings. 99th percentile goes up to 480ms but seems to float nearer to 100ms.

Deletes has a crazier 99th percentile but a similar mean. Way fewer of them
happen."

**Explanation**: compute_time_listings is slow. Really slow. At a quick glance, here are the jobs running right now:

    date: Sun Jan 17 20:04:56 PST 2016
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 ri ri 1.2G Jan 17 12:37 comment-week-data.dump
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 ri ri 683M Jan 17 12:25 comment-week-thing.dump
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 ri ri  53G Jan 16 07:13 comment-year-data.dump
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 ri ri  31G Jan 16 04:37 comment-year-thing.dump
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 ri ri 276M Jan 17 17:04 link-week-data.dump
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 ri ri  70M Jan 17 17:03 link-week-thing.dump

So the currently running top-comments-by-year listing has been running for nearly 37 hours and isn't done. top-comments-by-week has been running for 8 hours. top-links-by-week has been running for 3 hours. And this is just me checking on currently running jobs, not actual completion times.

The slow bit is the actual writing to Cassandra in `write_permacache`. This is mostly because `write_permacache` is extremely naive and blocks waiting for individual writes with no batching or parallelisation. There are a lot of ways to work around this and some of them will become easier when we're not longer writing out to the permacache at all, but until then (and even after that) this approach lets us keep doing the simple-to-understand thing while parallelising some of the work.

**The approach**: `compute_time_listings` is written as a mapreduce job in our `mr_tools` toolkit, with `write_permacache` as the final reducer. In `mr_tools`, you can run multiple reducers as long as a given reducer can be guaranteed to receive all of the keys for the same key. So this patch adds `hashdist.py`, a tool that runs multiple copies of a target job and distributes lines to them from stdin using their first tab-delimited field to meet this promise. (The same script could apply to mappers and sorts too but in my tests for this job the gains were minimal because `write_permacache` is still the bottleneck up to a large number of reducers.)

**Numbers**: A top-links-by-hour listing in prod right now takes 1m46.387s to run. This patch reduces that to 0m43.960s using 2 jobs (a 60% savings). That top-links-by-week job that before I killed after 3 hours completed in 56m47.329s. The top-links-by-year job that I killed last week at over 36 hours finished in 19 hours.

**Downsides**: It costs some additional RAM: roughly 10mb for hashdist.py and 100mb in memory for each additional copy of the job. It multiplies the effective load on Cassandra by the number of jobs (although I have no reason to believe that it's practical to overload Cassandra this way right now; I've tested up to 5 jobs).

**Further work**: with this we could easily do sort|reducer fusion to significantly reduce the work required by the sorter. `hashdist.py` as written is pretty slow and is only acceptable because `write_permcache` is even slower; a non-Python implementation would be straight forward and way faster."

In the permacachezlib patch we want to be able to time how long we're spending
doing the compression and serialisation. There are times that we use the
permacache in the AMQP worker thread, which can't get to g, so it can't get to
g.stats. The solution is probably to just stop using the permacache in this way,
but first we'll want to know what it would cost us to start doing these
operations in the foreground.

Most permacache mutations occur in queue processes where it shouldn't matter,
but there are cases like deletions and inboxes where they occur in-request. So
knowing the costs of foregrounding them is important.

Note that this causes the timers to occur in the worker thread. That has known
to be safe in the past, but it's been a while since the support was used."

By default, Linux's sort(1) uses locale-based sorting. Normally this is what
humans want, but for mapreduce it breaks the guarantee that the same reducer
always sees each instance of the same key. Here's an example:

    user/comment/top/week/1102922   26  1453516098.92   t1_cz8jgq9

According to sort(1) using the default locale, this is already sorted.
Unfortunately, that means that to a reducer this list represents 6 different
listings (each of which will overwrite the previous runs of the same listing).
But that's not what we want. It's actually two listings, like:

    user/comment/top/week/1102922   26  1453516098.92   t1_cz8jgq9

    user/comment/top/week/11029228  1   1453292232.55   t1_cz53uxe

To do this, we need to set the enviroment variable LC_ALL=C when running sort(1)
to indicate that the sorting should operate only on the raw bytes.

It looks like this has been broken since the Trusty Tahr upgrade."

We have our Mako filters set to escape HTML by default. Unfortunately RSS
requires double escaping in some places and not in others, so there isn't a
reasonable default. Here I have done a pass through the `.xml` templates to find
user data that's ending up single-escaped and added double escaping to them.

This requirement is because RSS grew HTML support organically in a way that
clients can't tell if a field actually contains HTML or not. Sometimes it's
double escaped, sometimes it's not. Clients have to take a guess by sniffing for
`&gt;` characters and hoping they get it right. This also means that it's
impossible for servers to reliably tell the clients which data this field
contains.

This is a bit of a ticking time bomb. Users may find ways to sneak in HTML in
the date field, or we may add new templates that forget to do double escaping on
little-used fields. I recommend that we switch these to use Atom which always
indicates whether the fields contain HTML or not. Work has started on this
conversion in another branch.

`VRatelimit` doesn't handle rate-limiting just via the decorator; it requires a
call to its `ratelimit` function in order to record usage (since various errors
or other conditions may prevent the user from ""using"" a resource).  This second
call has been missing from `POST_read_all_messages`, thus making the
ratelimiting useless.

Additionally, any errors set by `VRatelimit` weren't being checked, so if
someone *did* go over the ratelimit, we wouldn't change any behavior.

Now both of those things are fixed.

I considered migrating this to `VImprovedRatelimiter`, but there's really no
reason you'd need to mark all your messages as read multiple times in a short
span; you've marked them *all* as read."

Many of the other validators have a 'fatal' flag that controls whether errors
will be added to some sort of object that the controller can access, or if
they'll just cause a failed request immediately.  This is useful when the
controller doesn't want to do any special behavior and would just abort for
each error case."

After the 'mark all as read' button fires off a POST to request the
marking-of-all-as-read, it polls `/api/me.json` to find out whether or not the
user has any mail, refreshing the page when they no longer do.  As a fail-safe,
if the poll fails 20 times, we just refresh the page anyways, assuming it's
probably a race condition and there's a new message waiting for them.

However, the first call to the polling function was coming directly as a
callback from `r.ajax`, which meant it was passed in the response instead of a
null count (as it expects).  Thanks to Javascript's weak typing, the counter
increment was instead just appending the string ""1"" to the end of the response,
which would never trigger the end condition.

The callback is now a simple little wrapper around the polling function to
prevent any arguments from being initially passed in."

There were a couple of errors with the way the maximum event size was being
limited that this fixes:

* Only the maximum batch size was being accounted for, not the maximum
  size of an individual event (which is 20% of the batch limit).
* When truncation was done, we were adding an is_truncated field to the
  event, but the truncation didn't account for the size of this new
  field.

This commit fixes these issues and moves the truncation-handling into a
new wrapper class called PublishableEvent, instead of doing it inside
the queue-processor itself. It also takes advantage of the
application_headers support on amqp messages to send info about which
field is truncatable separate from the actual event data. This lets us
avoid needing to deserialize the JSON unless truncation is actually
necessary (and supported).

Graphite events are also added so that we can more easily track how
often oversize events need to be truncated or dropped."

When accounts are deleted, we leave almost all of the data related to
them around forever. This results in our builders needing to skip a lot
of items related to long-deleted accounts, and also has various other
unusual effects like causing some subreddits to have shorter (or even
empty) moderator lists in their sidebars because all of the top 10
moderator accounts have been deleted and left in the list.

This commit moves 2 existing pieces of cleanup out of the immediate
tasks that are performed on deletion into the delayed cleanup, removes
the cleanup of oauth app developer permissions (because this code has
never actually worked) and then adds many more new cleanup tasks. The
moved ones are:

1. remove the deleted user from others' friend lists
2. remove the deleted user from others' blocked lists

The new cleanup tasks performed during the delayed cleanup are:

1. Remove the deleted user's email address from their account
2. Unsubscribe the deleted user from all of their subscribed subreddits
3. Remove the deleted user from all moderator positions
4. Cancel any outstanding moderator invites to the deleted user
5. Remove the deleted user from all contributor positions
6. Unban the deleted user from all subreddits they were banned from
7. Unban the deleted user from all subreddit wikis they were banned from
8. Remove the deleted user from all wiki contributor positions
9. Remove all of the user's flair relations in subreddits

A usernote will be added to the deleted account after the cleanup that
lists information about most of these tasks - which subreddits they were
subscribed/demodded/etc. from, so that the information is not lost
completely."

The return value of the __exit__ function of a context manager is only

From PEP-0343:

    is ""swallowed"".

We were noticing an issue with Q&A sort threads where admin-distinguished
non-OP comments were showing up both in the proper place as well as like
top-level comments.  The root of this was that while those comments were
skipped from being auto-collapsed, this didn't affect any of their ancestors.
This caused the comment builder to remove the ancestors from consideration, so
when it came to the distinguished comment, we thought it was a top-level
comment (because we had deleted its parent from the ""in consideration"" set).

There are a couple of ways to handle this, but the easiest was to expand
ancestor-expansion to all comments that are immune from auto-collapse.  It also
makes sense from a product perspective."

When a moderator visits the PM composition page, we change the 'from' field a
bit depending on how a few things.  For a moderator who isn't in timeout,

* /message/compose shows a drop-down of their username and all subreddits they
  moderate
* /r/mod/message/compose shows a drop-down of their username and all subreddits
  they moderate
* /r/example/message/compose shows a read-only field indicating the message is
  coming from /r/example, unless the user doesn't moderate that subreddit (in
  which case they get a 403)

None of this behavior should be altered by this commit.

When a user is in timeout, we only allow them to message /r/reddit.com.  While
there are separate backend restrictions for this, we also have the frontend
force only that option.  However, moderators have been getting one of their
subreddits forced as the sender instead, which causes an error (subreddits
cannot message other subreddits) and doesn't really make much sense, anyways.

I refactored the logic here a bit to make this all a bit more straightforward.
In particular, the only time `from_user` was set to false was in the second
case above, and `mod_srs` was set at the same time to a one-element list, which
lead to some strange length-checking to make sure the one-subreddit case wasn't
because of only moderating one subreddit.

Now a moderator in timeout will no longer have the option to choose who to send
a message as - it will look like the non-mod message compose page, which
defaults to sending a message as the user themselves."

Ever since we added OAuth developers in reddit/reddit@cc40171, we've been
silently filtering out deleted and spammed users in any of the developer
listings.  Recently, we added users in timeout to that list as well.

This can cause some unexpected behavior at times.  One of the most notable is
the check of the developer list when we remove a dev: if there aren't any more
devs, we delete the app.  If a developer of a popular app gets themselves in a
temporary timeout or accidentally gets spammed, this would break the app for
all its users, which is less than ideal.

We discussed this a bit and decided there's not a good reason to tie these
things together.  If a user needs disciplining, that shouldn't affect their
app.  If a user is a spammer, that shouldn't affect their apps (because you
can't do much with that anyways).  And if we actually do want to remove a
user's developer access to an app (say, because they're using it to create
massive amounts of spam), we should do that with a separate tool.

I did leave the filtering out of deleted users in place.  Partly this was
because otherwise a number of other places in the code would need to add
various conditionals to deal with the situation, and I was lazy, but mostly
it's because we shouldn't have any of these, anyways: account deletion removes
the user from all of their apps, and you can't add a deleted user back as a new
developer."

VNotInTimeout checks to see if the user is in timeout. If the user is,
then an event is sent that the user attempted a forbidden action.

The details_text of the event is based off of the action_name. If the
action_name has been passed in, that will override the action_name that
exists in the request object.

Different actions have different targets, so the target chosen is based
off the action_name if the target hasn't been passed in. Additionally,
if the target is not of the type Subreddit, the subreddit that the action
is being performed in will be passed in the event payload."

This is the first step in trying to fix a long-standing annoyance with

""NSFW"" or ""NSFL"" in its title. This is because the title check is
currently done at display-time, instead of just doing the check at
submit-time and have the flag default to enabled if the title matches.

In order to fix this, we'll need to do it in three steps:

1. Start marking NSFW at submit-time if the title matches (this commit)
2. Do a backfill to mark all past posts as NSFW if their title matches
3. Turn off the display-time check"

We maintain a system that (poorly) tries to decide if it should send a
304 for logged-out users on comments pages and userpages. There are a
lot of errors in the logic for this system that's causing us to not send
304s in cases that we should, and send them in cases where we shouldn't.

Instead of trying to fix all the errors in this system, we're just going
to remove it and leave that up to the CDN. I performed a test on
2015-09-14 by completely disabling the system that confirmed that it
could be removed without significant negative impact to the site.

There will be behavior changes to /r/friends as a result of this.
Previously, we were taking advantage of the timestamps stored by this
system to try to figure out which 100 friends (out of the 500 most
recently added to friends list) had most recently interacted with the
site, and pull posts from those users for /r/friends. Since we no
longer have these timestamps, this has been switched to just pick 100
friends at random every half hour, similar to how subreddits are
selected for a user's front page."

As seen here: https://redd.it/3jaoe9

Embed.ly would occasionally cache data before the thumbnail was
available for the page AND reddit's internal cache would also cache the
meta data without the thumbnail, causing that link to appear without a
thumbnail site wide. And when attempting to use the ""retry thumb""
function, it would simply look at the internally cached data without the
thumb and return nothing again.

So 2 problems were fixed here:

1. If the media data does not contain a thumbnail, don't cache it
   internally, fixing the bug that causes the ""retry thumb"" to fail
   every time.
2. If thumbnail cannot be found from Embedly data, do a second attempt
   using the _ThumbnailOnlyScraper to bypass Embedly's cached data.

This could have also been accomplished by passing a ""forced=true""
parameter to the EmbedlyScraper, but since it would have involved quite
a few more changes, I though the simpler course of action would be to
use the _ThumbnailOnlyScraper instead."

There've been a few instances in the past where we poisoned downstream
caches with loggedin responses for several hours before realizing it was
happening. Each time we only realized it once a user reported that they
were being logged in as someone else.

This PR attempts to make it easier to detect upticks in cache poisoning
by adding a cache poisoning canary[0] cookie. The canary cookie is a
random, non-identifying, persistent cookie that is included in every
request and sent back with every loggedin HTML response. If the canary
in the response is different from the one we would have sent, we know
that cache poisoning occurred.

If the client detects it has been served an improperly cached page,
it tries to gather extra data about the page (such as some of the
headers sent with response for the current page.) With those, we can
often figure out _how_ the cache was poisoned (did CF cache it, did
an intermediary proxy mess with the `Cache-Control` headers?) We can
also sometimes find out what was served with the poisoned response,
and if the victim is now likely able to perform actions as the poisoner.)

We also keep track of what cache policy was used, so we can experiment
with incremental rollout of new cache policies and see how they affect
the incidence rate of poisoned caches.

We keep track of the overall cache poisoning report rate in tallier,
and send a more detailed report to event-collector so we can figure
out what's causing all the poisonings and who was affected after the fact.

A huge portion of the queries to the subreddit databases are _by_name
lookups for subreddits that don't exist.  By caching negative lookups,
we can hopefully reduce some portion of these.  This is somewhat of an
experiment though because

1) it assumes that there will be a decent hit
rate on the negative lookups, i.e. that they're not a super long-tail
distribution of crazy names, and

2) that the cached negative lookups won't have worse effects on the
system by filling the caches with negative results which leave less room
for ""real"" data."

Our throttling on the share dialog has been a bit odd.  We didn't allow you to
share more than once every `RL_RESET_MINUTES`, **unless** you have at least
`MIN_RATE_LIMIT_KARMA` in the subreddit you're sharing from.  Why was this tied
to the subreddit?  Who knows!

Rather than having a draconian limit and exempting some users from it, the rate
limits on sharing should now be at a reasonable level for everyone (and
configurable as we go with `RL_SHARE_AVG_PER_SEC`).  In addition, we're now
using the fairly new ratelimit library, which allows for burstable usage, so a
user who wants to share several things in a row but then goes back to normal
browsing is much less likely to get throttled."

This change was intended primarily to address an issue related to
duplicate username mentions - each individual mention was being counted
towards the per-comment limit, instead of it only counting mentions of
different users. So mentioning the same user 4 times in a comment would
cause butler to bail out instead of sending a mention to that user.

So this makes it so that extract_user_mentions now returns the
mentioned usernames as a set instead of a list, and also removes the
support inside the function itself for only returning up to a maximum
number of mentions. It is now up to the caller to worry about handling
the number of mentions returned (which actually simplifies things almost
everywhere this is currently being used)."

The variable that holds the result of attempting to match the search
check was not being reset for each individual check, so if a check was
skipped due to its fields being discarded, it would keep the same value
it had from a previous check.

In practice, this means that a check like this will not match on a link
submission to baddomain.com:

    url+body: ""baddomain.com""
    ~body: ""I'm an exception""

The match from the url check would still be present after the ~body
check was skipped, so this would end up causing the rule to be
considered unsatisfied, since the ~body check would seem to have matched
successfully."

The previous method of determining whether a user had interacted with a
particular subreddit (to decide whether to send them a ""you've been
banned"" message or not) was by checking to see whether they had any
karma (positive or negative) in the subreddit, or if they were currently
subscribed to it. This missed a fair number of cases, most significantly
that making self-posts would not count as having interacted with the
subreddit, since they have no effect on karma.

This commit uses a DenormalizedRelation to track whether a user has
interacted with the subreddit (actually *when* they last interacted with
it, though that data is currently unused). It adds one new type of
action that is considered interaction - sending a modmail to the
subreddit.  It also removes the error/warning from the ban page about
trying to send a ban message to someone that has never interacted with
the subreddit, since that should no longer really be a concern."

We'd like to be able to show some sort of preview for NSFW images, rather than

We went back and forth a bit on whether a NSFW image should have the censored
version in the main image block (with the uncensored version as a variant), or
have the censored version be the variant.  We settled on the latter because an
app that doesn't build in NSFW link support will perhaps just shock a few
users, as opposed to preventing NSFW-seeking users from obtaining the content
they want.  It's also less of a backwards-compatibility change."

This is a minor rearrangement of some of the logic in
check_account_threshold(), which fixes at least 3 bugs:

1. Banned accounts were returning False from this function, even if
   there weren't actually any threshold checks to be performed. This
   means that any sort of rule involving an ""author:"" check could never
   be satisfied by a banned account, since this function would always be
   called and return False, regardless of what was actually in the
   author check.
2. Threshold checks with a value of exactly 0 would have never been
   checked, since that would have been evaluated as False and caused the
   check to be skipped inside the loop. These checks are rare since
   they're for equality instead of the much more common
   less-than/greater-than checks, but still could exist. So for example,
   a rule that was trying to check for brand new users by looking for
   ""comment_karma: 0"" would not have worked correctly.
3. Inadvertently setting satisfy_any_threshold to True without actually
   defining any threshold checks would have caused this function to
   always return False because reaching the bottom of the function
   returns the inverse of satisfy_any_threshold."

If you go to a userpage and sort by top (in either the overview or comments
tabs), and restrict the time range to anything other than ""all time"", no
comments will be shown.

The data in these listings is built from functions in `lib/db/queries.py`
(specifically from `get_comments()` down).  This ends up trying to pull the
query results from permacache (in `CachedResults.fetch_multi()`), defaulting to
an empty list if no cache entry is found.

Now, the cache entry is supposed to be populated periodically by a cronjob that
calls `scripts/compute_time_listings`.  This script (and its Python helpers in
`lib/mr_top.py` and `lib/mr_tools/`) generates a dump of data from Postgresql,
then reads through that and builds up entries to insert into the cache.  As
with many scripts of this sort, it expects to get in some bad data, and so
performs some basic sanity checks.

The problem is that the sanity checks have been throwing out all comments.
With no new comments, there's nothing new to put into the cache!

The root of this was a refactoring in reddit/reddit@3511b08 that combined
several different scripts that were doing similar things.  Unfortunately, we
ended up requiring the `url` field on comments, which doesn't exist because,
well, comments aren't links.

Now we have two sets of fields that we expect to get, one for comments and one
for links, and all is good.

We also now have a one-line summary of processed/skipped entries printed out,
which will help to make a problem like this more obvious in the future."

While investigating one issue I got distracted by another issue with the
newly-written `__eq__` method of `UrlParser`, which in turn got me frustrated
with the `_url_updates` attribute.

You see, after parsing a url into a `UrlParser`, we've been keeping the
original url parameters in `_query_dict`, updates to it in `_url_updates`, and
merging them together on `unparse()`.  At first glance, this seems like a
reasonable thing to do.

However, this was in reality a pretty weak guarantee.  The first time you call
`unparse()`, `_query_dict` was being updated with the contents of
`_url_updates`.  Additionally, it is very easy to accidentally modify the
`_query_dict` object (`unparse()` was probably doing it on accident).

A much better way to have a record of the original query string would be to
keep a separate copy of it in a privatish attribute - as with `_orig_url` and
`_orig_netloc`.  The good news is that I didn't find any place where we do in
fact need that, so I just left it out.  But it would be easy to add in the
future if necessary.

Anyways, now there is just **one** dictionary of query parameters - one place
to look when trying to determine the current state of the parsed url without
turning it back into a string."

We ran the numbers on how many people have set some sort of sorting preference
(this includes *anything* using `VMenu`, since the field is serialized in the
database), and it's much more than I anticipated.  Per some discussion, we
decided we should make a good attempt to migrate over users' sort preferences
so as to not needlessly annoy them.

While we could write a migration script that iterates through all users with
this option set, that would take a long time and probably affect a lot of
long-disused accounts.  Instead we're opting to dual-write the new and old
preferences whenever they're updated through the preferences page (the new
way).  Additionally, we're checking for inconsistencies between those two
preferences on every view of a comments page, and setting the new preference to
the value of the old preference if any difference is found.  That allows us to
ship quickly while still invisibly migrating the preference for active users -
even those who are only viewing comment threads, not changing the sort.

This is likely going to lead to an increase in queries as we start to deploy
it, but it should be ok if we just take it slow.

After we've reached some point at which the number of accounts migrating over
is low enough we no longer care, we can rip out this commit."

Now that we're not saving sort preferences when you select a new sort from the
menu in comment threads, we don't really need to have a `POST` endpoint for
comments; all that did was handle the save and redirect.

Untangling how this menu got created took me some time, so try to hold on while
I explain what's happening here.

`CommentSortMenu`, which handles, as you may guess, the sort menu for comments,
had `button_cls` set to `PostButton`.  That in turn defines its `_style` as
""post"".  And *that* has the effect of `post()`, defined in
`templates/navbutton.html`, being the function used to render the button (which
we do in `templates/navmenu.html`'s `dropdown()`).  And `post()` calls, not
surprisingly, `post_link()`, which builds up a `POST` form.

Ok, we'll pause for a minute to let that call chain seep in a little bit, at
least.  Good?

So now if we no longer set `button_cls`, we default to the parent's
`button_cls`, which is `QueryButton`.  `QueryButton`, as its name implies, is
designed to pass arguments in the query string, and does so through the normal
`plain_link()` (called from the template's `plain()`, which is used because the
`_style` is set to ""plain"").

Aside: we don't want to get rid of `PostButton` entirely because it's still
used by `ControversyTimeMenu`."

For a long time, reddit has had a hidden comment sort preference - when you
changed your sort using the menu, it would stick and stay as the default.  This
has lead to a lot of confusion, as people will change their sort for one
thread, then not realize that's used for all the rest (and so wonder why, say,
all the comments they're viewing have pretty low scores, because they don't
realize they're sorting by `new` now instead of `best`).

Now we're getting rid of that behavior and replacing it with an explicit
preference.

From a user perspective, the ideal way to handle this would be for us to use
the same backend; that would keep any sorts that people have set.  However, all
that logic was genericized into `VMenu` to deal with all sorts of menus called
from all sorts of controllers, and that ended up making the key to query
something rather incidental (`front_sort`).  I'm also not a fan of validators
having side effects like that, so I just gave up detangling `VMenu` and used
the more common `VOneOf` and a preference that fits in with the rest of user
preferences.

Additionally, we suspect many users who have changed their sorts to something
other than best have done so accidentally (that is, intending for it to be
temporary), so starting afresh might actually be a better option, anyways.  If
not, we can write a backfill to make this migration."

caused child comments to share the timestamp of their parent regardless

prequeued_votes is meant to hide the fact that votes are processed
asynchronously when a user refreshes a page right after voting (i.e. the
vote arrow will remain colored even if it wasn't processed fully yet on
the backend.)

Now that LastModified for votes is written in-request rather than in the
queue, we can take advantage of this to reduce the number of items we
have to look up prequeued_votes for.

A new configurable, vote_queue_grace_period, specifies what amount of
queue lag we're willing to paper over.  If the user hasn't voted in that
grace period, we just assume that the vote has been processed, skip
prequeued_votes lookups for it and go straight to Cassandra.
Additionally, if we are going to do lookups, we'll skip lookups for
items that were created since the last time the user voted like we were
already doing at the DenormalizedRelation layer.

This will likely shift some reads to Cassandra so we should keep an eye
on that."

This will allow us to trust LastModified for culling lookups to
prequeued_vote_keys. In a situation of bad queue lag, this could result
in more lookups going to Cassandra, as the LastModified culling in
DenomralizedRelation will be thrown off slightly, but that should be OK
as the bloom filters will catch the negative lookups quickly."

`event_click` is necessary for tracking clicks from users on embeds, which are
served via redditmedia, and therefore are always anonymous. When a user clicks
through, we want to know who they were and redirect them on their way. Because
of the way we're using nginx to store events as an access log right now, this

The ""visibility"" field can now also be set to ""hidden"" via the API. Hidden
multireddits will not be shown on a user's sidebar on reddit.com, but will

The ""copied_from"" field shows the multi's owner which multireddit
they copied from.

A ""weighting_scheme"" of ""fresh"" will favor newer content, rather than
forcing there to be at least 1 post from each subreddit. ""classic""
weighting will use the old format. Note: ""fresh"" weighting will be enabled
in a future commit.

""key_color"" must be an RGB color of the form #AABBCC. API consumers can
choose to set and make use of the key_color field for style purposes.

""icon_url"" may contain a URL to an icon for this multireddit. API
consumers can choose to make use of this icon for style purposes.

""display_name"" is a human-friendly name for this multireddit. API
consumers can choose to make use of this field to set/display friendlier
names for this multireddit.

Description fields are now included in the base multireddit object, and
""description_md"" can be updated directly on the multireddit object.
The separate description endpoint is still available.

All of the above fields can be modified via the existing endpoint,
PUT /api/multi/<multipath>, except for fields marked read only.

Due to the number of new fields and the absence of an existing PATCH
endpoint for /api/multi/<multipath>, the existing PUT endpoint
has been updated to NOT clobber fields that aren't included in the
multi JSON, and to accept ""partial"" multireddit objects. This is to
prevent fields from getting clobbered by clients that haven't been
updated to send all the new data."

While in the process of rolling out comment embeds, we'd like to have restrict
our beta a bit - because by their nature, once embeds are out, we lose control
over them, making it extremely difficult to make changes.  So we're restricting
the embed generation modal to a certain subset of users (for now), but a savvy
user could simply modify an existing public embed to plug in another comment
id, which would defeat the point of restricting it.  Enter hmac.

We know generate a unique token for each comment, and only by using the
appropriate token will your embed work.  This will be transparent to users, as
its just another piece of the html that they copy and paste onto their website.

Performance-wise, we're generating tokens for every comment that can be
embedded.  However, for now that's a limited set, and the operation is pretty
fast (roughly 5ms for 1000 tokens on my dev VM); if that becomes a problem, we
can easily take this code out after we no longer need the restriction."

`add_sr()` has had, since reddit/reddit@b57dff70, a special-case when the
requested page was on https, where it would ignore whatever domain it would
normally set and use the current one instead.  As best as we can tell, this was
to prevent issues with a lack of https support on all reddit domains, eg links
on `https://pay.reddit.com` pointing to `https://www.reddit.com`.  This should
no longer be an issue.

Additionally, it has caused problems with the comment embeds, which are served
from `redditmedia.com` but need to have links pointing to `www.reddit.com`.

Now that this special-case doesn't exist, the function should act more
intuitively.  And hopefully that doesn't break anything too badly. :p

The request from the comment embed javascript to get the actual embed has been
going through `g.media_domain`.  This in turn meant that sometimes (namely,
when the embed was placed on an https page) the link to the comment was also
heading through the media domain.  While this works, we'd rather have users go
through the standard `www.reddit.com` domain for brand, caching, and probably
other infrastructure reasons."

At the bottom of the comment embeds is a link to the subreddit from which the
comment was extracted.  This link has had an extra domain appended, so we'd end
up with URLs like `http://www.redditmedia.com/www.reddit.com/r/worldnews`.

The problem stemmed from the fact that `get_domain()` returns a protocol-less
URL (`www.reddit.com/r/worldnews`).  Thus, `add_sr()` (which it ends up being
passed into) assumes it has been handed a relative URL and appends a domain.

Instead of getting the entire domain, we now just get the subreddit path and
let `add_sr()` handle the domain (and protocol) later."

The goal here is to reduce network traffic to the main cache nodes.
This will also affect the size of the objects in the cache which could
make things better by fitting more things in cache, or make things worse
by oversubscribing specific slabs. We should watch network traffic on
the cache nodes, hit rates, and eviction rates in the period after
rolling this out. Additionally, this will increase the amount of
gzipping app servers deal with, so response times and CPU should be
monitored as well.

I chose 1400 bytes to be a fudge-factor smaller than the MTU; since the
goal here is network efficiency and not cache memory space, going
smaller than a single packet isn't terribly important."

The goal of a login ratelimit system is to prevent brute force attacks
on passwords.

The current login ratelimit system is based on VDelay which uses
exponential backoff based on IP address after failed login attempts.
This is not ideal because of corporate proxies and LSN causing the
number of false positives to be very high resulting in users getting
the dreaded ""you've been doing that too much"".

This new system uses a factored out version of the core ratelimiting
system which uses fixed ratelimits per period (allowing some burstiness)
and is per-account. To help mitigate the effects of a denial of service
attack on a specific user, different ratelimit buckets are used
depending on whether or not the user has used the IP the login request
is coming from before.

As an escape hatch, successfully resetting an account's password adds
the current IP to that account's recent IPs allowing it into the safer
ratelimit bucket.

The ratelimit never applies if you are currently logged in as the user,
allowing account deletion to happen regardless of ongoing brute force /
denial of service attacks."

[Reported by][0] /u/josh64.

When the message RSS feeds were created, they erroneously had an extra timezone
appended to the `dc:date` element, which causes validation errors.

In most of the feeds we rely only upon `pubDate`; it's not clear to me why we
additionally use `dc:date` in the few places we do, but I suppose it doesn't
hurt anything.  The other two places using it are `subreddit.xml`, which never
had the extra timezone, and `comment.xml`, in which it was removed three years
ago (reddit/reddit@5675398).  This fixes the last incorrect instance.

Note: Although the reporter says they got an error in the W3C validator and the
format is clearly wrong, in my tests the validator passed the previous,
incorrect feed. *shrug*

Commit 8f1ab15 addressed an issue we were seeing where some subreddit had
huge font sizes with the new markdown styles applied.  The solution was to
structure the styles such that <p> elements had a default font-size of 1em,
which worked well.  Unfortunately, because of the way that the sidebar styles
are structured (and because I kind of forgot about them in that solution),
this caused the opposite problem for some subreddits' sidebars: tiny text.
This applies the same solution to the sidebar text, and does a little bit
of refactoring along the way.

This replaces most references to absolute numbers with variable references.
A scale of font sizes, line heights, and margins used are defined at the top
of the file, and pretty much everything references those (except for small
stuff like borders.). I thought this was slightly easier to reason about than
doing `font-size: @base + 2;` kind of stuff, but it might be a little
overboard."

Inbox messages display with a tiny font size when viewing with the new markdown
styles.  This is due to a change introduced in e8d0ce7.

<longwindedexplaination>
    The idea behind that change was to make the default font-size for `.md`
    elements `14px` while still using relative font sizes (using `ems` and
    keywords).  This lets us continue to respect browser preferences _and_
    makes the styles a _little_ harder to break via custom css (before this,
    increasing the font size of `.md` could drastically increase a subreddit's
    font size).

    In order to do this, you actually have to use two elements, because
    browsers only provide a limited set of absolute font sizes that respect
    user preferences (via keywords). The outer element uses a keyword font size
    to reset the base font size to the nearest keyword value `small (13px)`,
    and the inner `.md` element scales that up to the desired default font size
    using `ems`.  I thought that using `.wiki-page-content` for wiki pages and
    `usertext-body` for everything else covered it, but it turns out that
    message pages don't wrap message with `UserText`, so the `.md` text there
    is getting scaled up from the site default size of `x-small (10px)`.

    The end result is that we can use `p { font-size: 1em; }`, so if some
    stylesheet author decides they want to set
    `.md { font-size: <whatever>px }`, that's what they'll get.
</longwindedexplaination>

Rather than adding _another_ css rule trying to target the messages page (which
I don't think is possible without side effects anyway), I did two things:
first, I added an extra css class _specifically_ for this purpose
(`.md-container`) and applied to both the `wiki-page-content` and
`usertext-body` elements; and second, wrapped the offending markdown on the
inbox page with an element of that class."

Thanks to Hamid Ashraf (/u/hamihax) for the report! A lot of
user-agents allow windows and tabs to navigate their openers through
`window.opener.location`.

This creates a potential phishing risk where a victim with the
""open links in a new window"" pref clicks a link submitted by an
attacker. The attacker's page may then navigate the reddit page that
opened it. When the user closes the tab with the attacker's submitted
content, they'll be greeted with an attacker controlled page, and
they would be less likely to notice since the tab previously contained
a page served by reddit.

IMO this is really a flaw in same-origin policy, but the behaviour is
present in a number of browsers."

When a user reports a message, we've been checking to make sure it's actually
sent to them.  However, when a message is sent to a subreddit's moderation
team, any member of the mod team should be able to report the message, despite
it not being sent to *them*, directly.

We now extend the check to also check for moderator status if necessary.

""register an account"" and friends to ""create an account"".

The purpose of these changes is to verify that a situation is not occurring.
Currently, a situation could theoretically arise where a lock expires for
one thread, a new thread gets a new lock on the same key, and the old thread
then completes. The out of order deletion of the lock would cause a cascade
effect, and the lock would then be entirely ineffective for all threads

thrown."

cases for votes: day-based data dumps: the about page shows a count of
votes day-to-day, and some awards use yesterday's votes to determine
winners.

reddit uses Google Analytics[0] as a tool to track events on the reddit.com
website, which allows for gathering page load and user event data while
keeping users anonymized. However, with the high volume[1] of traffic
that reddit recieves, the data collection limit[2]-- even with a premium
account-- is often surpassed by a large volume.

Wikpedia states[3] ""... sampling is concerned with the selection of a
subset of individuals from within a statistical population to estimate
characteristics of the whole population."" We can, using this principle,
send a small portion of user events to Google Analytics collection
endpoints rather than sending the entire data set and achieve a
reasonable approximation of global user behavior without exceeding
reasonable data usage limits as defined by Google Analaytics.

In order to achieve this, the Google Analytics javascript library
provides a method to set a sampling rate[4], a percentage from 1-100.
By calling:

```
_gaq.push(['_setSampleRate', '80']);
```

One can set the sample rate to 80% of users. In reddit's case, I suggest
a default sampling rate of 50%. Here, I have added the `_setSampleRate`
properties to the `_gaq` object created within `utils.html`. It gets its
value from the config, which allows for easy value changes and avoids
using a 'magic value' set multiple places in the code.

In general, non-power users tend to not open links in new tabs.  This provides
problems for sites like ours, since we end up with a very high bounce rate -
people click on a submission link, end up on some other interesting site, and
forget all about how they got there.  If that link instead opens in a new
window (tab), that problem is solved.

This is a pretty common behavior on link-aggregation sites, eg Google News.

We definitely don't want to change this for existing users, because that
creates a very confusing change.  Additionally, we're not sure if we will want
to keep this around for everyone, so rather than change the default and

I noticed that in Chrome, some of our buttons had no padding at all, which made
them look terrible.  Others, however, were fine.  This turned out to be a
different between `<input type=""submit"">` and `<button>` elements.  The easiest
place to see this was comparing the save buttons on `/prefs` (ugly) and any of
the other preferences tabs (pretty).

In `reddit.less`, we reset the margin and padding of a whole bunch of elements
to be 0.  `<input>`s are in this list, although `<button>`s are not.\*  Thus,
no padding.

Now we set the padding `<button>`s and select types of `<input>`s.  I chose the
rules from what Chrome automatically applies, since that seemed like a
reasonable default.

Firefox notably ignored the `padding: 0` before, and continues to ignore
whatever I set, with the result that it looked good before and still looks
good now.  Whatever.

\* I decided not to add a reset of button margin and padding.  Padding we now
set again to something useful, per this commit, but margin could have effects
across the site that I didn't want to track down."

We got [a bug report][0] that attempting to submit a link to a text-only
subreddit (or vice versa) was failing silently.  This turns out to have been an
unintended consequence of 5da814b.

Somewhat unintuitively, `JsonResponse`'s `has_errors()` method modifies state
in the response object; if one of the errors you tell it to check for is found
in the global `c.errors`, it caches that determination in an instance variable.
This variable is then what's looked at in `make_response()`, which is called by
the `validatedForm()` decorator we put on the endpoint.

So, when we return early from a controller without making the appropriate
`has_errors()` call, the error doesn't make its way to the end user, and that's
exactly what was happening.

This change addresses the immediate issue by ditching the `sr` check entirely
and instead relying on `VSubmitSR` (and checking for all the errors it can
add).  However, the larger problem of flow and unexpected state mutation is
still there - mostly because I'm not sure how to go about dealing with it.

Adding a search submit button affected the tabbing behavior in the search box -
namely, it now began to take two tabs, rather than one, to get to the ""limit my
search to /r/whatever"" when on a subreddit page.

This changes add an explicit ordering: search text -> limit my search -> submit
button.  While this adds an extra tab to get to the submit button, that's not
really necessary, as pressing enter anywhere on the form also submits it.

There are many elements on the page with tabindices defined.  However, with the
exception of the ""jump to content"" link, they seem fairly random, so I'm not
terribly concerned about adjusted the overall index of the search form (that
is, how many tabs it takes to get to it from a freshly-loaded page).  It is
roughly in the same place as before - far enough down no one will want to tab
all the way to it. :)"

When browsers first introduce support for new CSS features, they often do so
with a *vendor prefix* - `-moz-` for Firefox, `-webkit-` for Chrome and Safari,
`-ms-` for IE.  It's annoying to deal with all of these, so we've written a few
Less functions to help.

Unfortunately, we haven't consistently used them.  This is most evident in how
the search box looks wonky to people using older versions of Firefox, because I
didn't use the `-moz-` prefix to `box-sizing`.

From a quick search, it looks like the only two functions we didn't use all the
time are `.transition` and `.box-sizing`; this should change all un-functioned
instances over.  This shouldn't affect a huge percentage of users, but it's
easy enough to do.

Although subreddits can have fairly large names (20-something characters), most
of them don't, so in practice we shouldn't be cutting off much of the title.

This makes it so that instead of seeing text like this:

we'll get

    This is a long...

when truncating ""This is a long title"".  Usually this is just a minor
improvement, but occasionally odd truncation can [lead to hilarious
results][0].  And, y'know, I don't like hilarity.

We currently only use `trunc_string` in a few places, all related to the
displayed titles or descriptions in Facebook OpenGraph notes or Twitter Cards,
so the impact isn't too terribly great.  We are now including the suffix in the
length count, so that might actually fix a bug.

We don't use the `length` parameter by keyword anywhere, so changing it isn't a
problem.

[Twitter Cards][0] are little snippets of information that get displayed in

While there is [a Twitter Cards validator][1], it requires pulling the page
itself, which makes this difficult to test.  We also have to make sure to run
it through the validator to get approval before it goes live; it's unclear if
this acceptance process is automated.  The code that adds the Card is protected
by a feature flag to help with this.

There are [some restrictions][2] on filesize for images, but I don't
think we want to deal with that one, at least not yet.

For some reason, Twitter's image server will sometimes gzip the main
profile picture found on a tweet page. Since we don't properly deflate
this gzipped image in _fetch_image_size(), we end up tossing out the
main account's profile image as a possible thumbnail. Since this
behaviour only happens sometimes, our scraper eventually finds a
non-gzipped image it can use, meaning we sometimes snag some random
person's profile image erroneously.

Example: http://redd.it/2gh3mu

Images generally don't benefit from gzip compression. We also chunk
image fetching so it is unlikely we'll grab much more than 1k. Instead
of trying to deflate these oddly gzipped images, I've made
_initialize_request() not fetch gzipped objects by default, and have

however ""32 hours ago"" would be displayed instead. This is because the

I've received multiple requests from people to confirm why their site
isn't scraping properly despite being set up with embedly. The reason is
the scraper_q wasn't restarted recently and therefore it was still using
an old service list.

Since the service list is memoized, it doesn't really matter if we
""fetch"" it on every iteration. This also allows the lookup to be moved
out of the higher layers of the queue which shouldn't have knowledge of
embedly down to the correct place."

This change allows you to pass a list of srid36s and get back recommendations
for all of them at once, which is useful for multireddit suggestions.

A function that accepted a single subreddit id as an argument and memoized the
results was removed and its functionality replaced by sgm caching, which sets
multiple items in memcache at once.

A source prefix is added to the row key so multiple sets of recs can be stored
in the same column family.

Adult items are filtered unless one of the original subreddits was over_18.

Recommendations for a set of subreddits are merged and sorted by the number of
items matched. (User feedback showed that people perceive recommendations as
incorrect if they don't match the ""theme"" of a large multi, and recs that
match several srs in the multi instead of just one are more likely to fit the
theme, so we show those first.)"

This does several things to subreddit stylesheets:
- stores them on the thumbs buckets rather than the main static bucket.
  (this was not desirable before on reddit.com due to CDN configuration)
- enforces a new restriction of custom (%%style%%) images only in
  stylesheets to make secure urls easier to resolve. existing subreddits
  are grandfathered in for now.
- writes, if possible as above, a second stylesheet that references
  subreddit images over https.

At some point in the future, the thumbs buckets should be directly accessible
on HTTPS via the same URLs which would remove the need for the second
stylesheet to be created and uploaded. The custom image rules and other changes
would still be good."

significantly faster than the current condition (~25 second runtime

The first time we tried to move /r/all/comments to the new query cache,
the row quickly grew to be massive because tombstones were piling up in
the row cache. The row started taking seconds to retrieve after only 12
hours.

We reverted.

We took gc_grace_seconds down to 30 minutes which is relatively safe in
the query cache (prunes can be re-executed without issue and lost
deletes of non-pruned things will be covered by keep_fns).
Additionally, we switched to the leveled compaction strategy for the
relevant column families.

Then we tried this again. This time, things ran fine for three days
before we started seeing out-of-memory issues on the nodes responsible
for this key.  The row size was rather large again.

We reverted.

Now, we're trying again with three more changes, working on the
hypothesis that runaway growth of a hot query can happen because prunes
start failing after a small bad spike.

* tdb_cassandra.max_column_count has been drastically reduced in favor
  of xget for the models that actually need to fetch hugely wide rows.
  This saves memory pressure via materialized thrift buffers in general
  and when the row grows large for whatever reason.

* The pruning behaviour has been tweaked to only prune a portion of the
  extraneous columns if there are a large number.  This should reduce
  the likelihood that prunes will fail after a row has grown too much.

* This query is now in its own column family that is designed to have
  its rowcache disabled.

Why bother shoehorning this query into this data model, you say? It's a
canary for extreme scaling of other queries.  If we can't fix this
problem for this query, we should re-evaluate the whole data model."

Previously, setting data props on a thing would result in a SELECT to
determine which data properties already existed, and then a sequence of
INSERTs and UPDATEs (with some batching) to get the database in the
right state.

The account master wasn't too happy with those extra selects, so we
made it so that the app would optimistically UPDATE and if no rows were
changed do INSERTs instead (with appropriate batching as above).

Unfortunately, this greatly increases the number of operations done when
adding new data props, such as at thing creation time, and on some
tables that's almost entirely all of the workload.

This patch takes advantage of the fact that we know no data attributes
will exist at thing creation time and therefore we can blindly INSERT
without doing UPDATEs or SELECTs first to try and reduce the number of
extraneous operations we do."

DenormalizedRelation instead puts all of the relationships into a single row
per thing1 and only fetches the desired columns on read. This means that most
of the time, we'll do a single-row lookup to determine what we want and the
majority of the time we will get a very fast response from the row-level bloom

on the node to be notified, by ZooKeeper, of changes. This means that
running the writer script with new data will automatically propagate the
changes to every app very quickly, without restart.

The writer script relies on a human-entered password to authenticate
with ZooKeeper. The reddit app uses a different set of credentials
(specified in the INI file) to obtain read-only access to the
configuration data.

Fixes the following bug:
A user was unable to authorize campaign because clicking Pay raised
an exception.

Cause:
The user's record was missing from the authorize_account_id table. Our code
has some logic to parse the customer id from the authorize error response when
this happens and rewrite the record, but the regexp was out of date.

This change updates the regexp to match the current authorize.net error msg
format and logs some info to make it easier to catch the problem if the format
changes again in the future.

Note:
- Why would a user record be missing in the first place? Should be looked into."

PG9 doesn't like the query from _load_link_comments
in comment_tree.py.

thing.py will automatically filter deleted and spam items
out of thing queries if no rules are specified for those
columns. To get around this, some queries, including the
_load_link_comments one, will specify a rule
like _spam == (True, False). This rule was left in the ruleset,
despite the fact that it's completely unnecessary from the
SQL's standpoint. Its presence then triggered the need of a
join against the thing table when only the data table was
truly necessary. The query planner in PG9 doesn't like this
particular query when it requires a join and will force a
full table scan as a result.

This patch notes the special case of _spam/_deleted ==
(True,False) and turns off the default filtering but removes
the rules from the query. This saves some WHERE clauses
and more importantly removes the need for a JOIN in queries
like this one."

* up in your inbox, with all fields replaced with the text ""[blocked]"".

* You may not PM or make a comment reply to a user that you've blocked.
* This is to prevent abuse of the system by pre-emptively blocking a
* user and then sending them a series of harassment messages.

At present, the only way to block a user is from your inbox; if they PM
you or make a comment reply. There is a new ""block user"" button.
Unblocking a user can be done via /prefs/friends. This is to keep
'blocks' from being used commonly; in general, we prefer to encourage
the use of the downvote arrow for bad comments, and leave user-blocking
for true harassment scenarios."

Since updating jQuery, the library has new behavior for deep serializing
objects and arrays. This old code accidentally passed in an array, which
triggered the new serialization code. The old code was taking advantage
of the older shallow jQuery parameter serialization, which calls
toString(), combined with the fact that singleton Arrays in JS stringify
into their first item stringified."

====
   * Uninstall the python Cassandra package that we previously depended on (it has a namespace conflict with the new package we depend on).  To find it:

     $ python -c ""import cassandra; print cassandra.__file__""

    and rm -r the .egg directory after ""site-packages/""

   * This version relies on cython, so if ""make"" fails, you may have to install cython via your distro's package manager.

     $ cd reddit/r2
     $ python setup.py develop # possibly with ""sudo"" depending on your install
     $ make

   * Cassandra is now required for the caching layer.  An example storage-conf.xml can be found in reddit/srv/cassandra.  Make sure that the additional <Keyspace> items are included in your conf file.

   * remove the query_queue_reader services if they are running.  add new gen_time_listings.sh instead.  Suggested cron:

    0    */2 *   *   *   $SCRIPTS/gen_time_listings.sh year '(""month"",""year"")'
    */5  *   *   *   *   $SCRIPTS/gen_time_listings.sh week '(""day"",""week"")'
    *    *   *   *   *   $SCRIPTS/gen_time_listings.sh hour '(""hour"",)'

   where $SCRIPTS is the location of this script directory

Features and Bugfixes
====
 * Mobile reddit:
   * templates are in r2/templates of the form *.compact
   * css is r2/public/static/css/compact.css
     * beginning of a sass-based (http://sass-lang.com/) compact.scss
   * reachable via .compact extension or from the ""i"" subdomain.
 * Cassandra is now *required*, and votes are currently written out to both cassandra and postgres (part of an eventual migration).
 * attempt to make the db connection code a little smarter.
   * A dropped DB connection will mark the connection dead and randomly attempt to reconnect.
