https://github.com/tildeio/htmlbars/pull/450 initially intended to fix
this, but while adding more examples to the test scenarios I zeroed in
on another bug (that was ultimately wider spread than this one).

When a closing block tag is followed by a newline, that newline is
stripped. We were properly handling the line being stripped, but not
resetting the column when we incremented the line.

This ensures that the column is reset to 0 if the lines are incremented."

    Single error here!
  {{else if errors}}
    Multiple errors here!
  {{else}}
    No errors found!
  {{/if}}

```

The `ElementNode` for the `<div>` was indicating that its
`loc.end.column` was 12. This is ultimately due to how Handlebars
handles trailing newlines after the `{{/if}}`. We were properly detecting
that the node was `rightStripped` and adding the number of stripped
newlines to the `tokenizer.line` number, but we did not reset the
`tokenizer.column` also.

The fix is to utilize the `ContentStatement`'s `loc` information to
reset the tokenizer's current position."

with dot syntax.

(either `params` and `attrs`) it gets compiled to `inline`. But when called
without any of them (`{{contextual.my-component}}`), it gets compiled to
a `range`.

The `range` calls to `handleRedirect` but sets `params` to be `[value]` instead
of an empty array, causing `positionalParams` to receive the wrong value."

When running in the browser, we rely on the browser’s built-in HTML
parsing for cases when users provide unescaped HTML content as dynamic
values in their templates (i.e., `{{{unsafeHTML}}}`). Because the final
output is a DOM tree, we ask the browser to parse the HTML and turn it
into a document fragment, then insert into the appropriate location in
the rendered element.

However, for server-side rendering, the final output is serialized HTML,
not a DOM tree. In the case of raw HTML provided by the user, we’d be
doing extra work to go from raw HTML -> parsed DOM -> serialized HTML.
(That we’d need an HTML parser also adds complexity.)

This patch allows us to detect an extension to the DOM API we’ve added
to SimpleDOM that allows us to insert a node in the DOM tree that means
“raw HTML” (similar to CDATA). When we go to serialize the DOM tree, any
raw HTML nodes are written as the HTML that was provided when created."

The current implementation of the DOM helper’s `protocolForURL` relies
on the implicit parsing and normalization that the browser’s DOM does
when setting the A element’s `href` property.

However, the DOM helper is often used with subset DOM implementations
like simple-dom. In those cases, we cannot rely on this normalization.

This commit detects when URL parsing doesn’t happen when setting the
`href` property on an `A` element and falls back to using Node’s
`URL` package."

`visitChildren` is used internally to visit all `Morph`'s and call a
callback on each one found.  The most common usage of `visitChildren` in
HTMLBars itself is for clearing morphs before rendering a new template.

Prior to this change, if we encounter a node with `morphList` we:

* add the `morphList` to the list of nodes to traverse
* call the provided callback
* traverse the `MorphList` and add all morphs found there to the list of
  morphs to call the callback on

In general that is fine, except when the callback itself (in step 2
above) is mutating the `morph` and preventing the `MorphList` from being
traversed. This is the case when changing an `{{if}}` with a `{{each}}`
from the template to the inverse block, in that case the callback is
calling `MorphList#clear()` which nullifies the `MorphList` but does not
call the various hooks (`didDestroyNode` specifically) so any morphs
would be leaked.

This change tweaks `visitChildren` to unroll a `MorphList` upon
encountering it (instead of waiting util after the callback has been
called on it). The included test demonstrates the memory leak that was
occurring in Ember and that it is properly fixed."

We are using `renderState.handledMorphs` as a way to know if a given
key is duplicated or not (if it is duplicated we use a binning strategy
to prevent errors), but we were setting `handleMorphs[key]`
to `null` when the given morph was the last item in the list.

The fix is to keep `renderAndCleanup` and `yieldItem` using the same
mechanism to know of the handled morphs (both should check via `key in
handledMorphs`)."

When an unsafe morph has HTML set on it, it parses that HTML and uses
the resulting nodes as its content.

This approach does not work in FastBoot, where there is no HTML parser
available at runtime. (In the browser, an element’s `innerHTML` is
used).

This commit adds a hook to the DOM helper, so an alternative strategy
can be swapped in in non-browser environments. This avoids the need to
swap out morph implementations in non-browser environments. In the
browser, this method just delegates to the morph’s own setHTML method."

This refactor cleans up and documents several aspects of the cleanup of
morphs between renders.

Importantly, it also addresses a bug when helpers switch from yielding
items (via yieldItem) to rendering a single template (via
yieldTemplate). In that case, the lazy cleanup was leaving the morphs
in an ambiguous state that was causing the parentNode hierarchy to be
lost.

Now, when we determine that a helper has switched from yieldItem to
yieldTemplate, we immediately clear the MorphList so that rendering
the new template into the morph ends up with the right delimiter nodes."

The yieldItem API is used for helpers like `{{#each}}` that yield zero
or more templates at render time.

On subsequent renders, it is HTMLBars’ responsibility to update the DOM,
moving around items that have changed position, removing items that have
been removed, and adding items that have not been seen before.

Previously, this algorithm would touch the DOM more often than necessary
for cases where the the list was largely the same but one or more items
were removed in the old list.

It operated by comparing the new yielded items in order with the
previous items, moving previously rendered items into the current
position or creating new items at that position for newly yielded keys.
At the end of the algorithm, items that had not been seen this rendering
pass were still in DOM but at the end of the list (because any rendered
values had been moved to the front of the list).

For example, imagine that we yield ABCD. On the subsequent render, we
yield BCD. Rather than simply deleting the “A” element, the old
algorithm would execute three “move” operations, moving B, C and D in
front of A, then finally deleting A once it got to the end.

In our new algorithm, deleted elements are left in place and the cursor
is incremented with the deleted element still in the DOM. As the
algorithm proceeds, it will only move items that have legitimately
changed position relative to their neighbors. Only once the entire
process has completed are the deleted elements finally removed from DOM.

In the example above, given that we yield ABCD, the subsequent render of
BCD would result in a single “delete” operation from the DOM.

Note that while this algorithm works well for lists that have large
common subsequences in roughly the same order, it works less well for
completely reordered lists. Future work to improve the reordering
case would be helpful. That said, note that the worst case of the
current algorithm is *still* better than a complete re-render from
scratch."

Previously, keywords could optionally implement a `childEnv` hook that
returned a new `env` that would be merged into the parent environment.
This environment was saved on the morph so that, on the next render, the
correct child env would be passed to child nodes even if that node was
not dirty (and thus the keyword will never be looked up and invoked).

One downside of this approach is that the “shape” of the env changes and
can lead to JIT deoptimizations. To solve this, we change the semantics
of the `childEnv` keyword hook to return the new child env, instead of
returning a “diff” that gets merged on top of the parent env. By moving
the logic of how child envs are derived out of HTMLBars, we can give
environments like Ember control over how envs and child envs are
created, and thus the ability to preserve JIT shape.

Because merging semantics are no longer built-in to HTMLBars, we cannot
rely on merging the last known child env for a keyword into the current 
env on re-renders where the keyword producing the child env is not
dirty. (It is not sufficient to just cache the last-used env; the parent
env may have changed between renders and those changes may need to be
reflected in the child env as well.)

To avoid having to go through a whole keyword-lookup procedure even for
non-dirty nodes, we simply cache the childEnv builder on the morph and
invoke it if the node is not dirty, allowing it to create the same env
as before but without the associated cost."

In some cases, a block helper will not always yield a template. For
example, imagine the `{{#if}}` helper if the condition is falsy and
there is no inverse.

In those cases, on re-render, the morph was being cleared every time
because htmlbars assumed that the template was going from template -> no template, when really it was going from no template -> no template.

This commit changes the logic to only clear a morph when going from
template -> no template, and avoids the performance penalty of always
touching the DOM even when nothing had changed."

Adds `buildMeta` callback to `compile` options.

If a `buildMeta` function is present in the options passed to `compile` or
`compileSpec`, the return value will be used for the `meta` key in the template
output.

This allows the host frameworks compiler to add metadata details (moduleName,
revision, etc) as needed.

```javascript
var template = compile('Hi, {{name}}!', {
  buildMeta: function(program) {
    return {
      isHTMLBars: true,
      revision: 'WAT@LOL.1234',
      loc: program.loc
    };
  }
});

template.meta.revision; // => 'WAT@LOL.1234'
```

---

Sample template output (no buildMeta callback):

```javascript
(function() {
  return {
    meta: {},
    arity: 0,
    cachedFragment: null,
    hasRendered: false,
    buildFragment: function buildFragment(dom) {
      var el0 = dom.createDocumentFragment();
      var el1 = dom.createTextNode(""Howdy "");
      dom.appendChild(el0, el1);
      var el1 = dom.createComment("""");
      dom.appendChild(el0, el1);
      return el0;
    },
    buildRenderNodes: function buildRenderNodes(dom, fragment, contextualElement) {
      var morphs = new Array(1);
      morphs[0] = dom.createMorphAt(fragment,1,1,contextualElement);
      dom.insertBoundary(fragment, null);
      return morphs;
    },
    statements: [
      [""content"",""name""]
    ],
    locals: [],
    templates: []
  };
}())
```

Sample output with a general `buildMeta` as Ember might use it:

```javascript
(function() {
  return {
    meta: {
      ""isHTMLBars"": true,
      ""revision"": ""SOME@REVISION"",
      ""moduleName"": ""my-app-name/templates/foo"",
      ""loc"": {""source"":null,""start"":{""line"":1,""column"":0},""end"":{""line"":1,""column"":14}}
    },
    arity: 0,
    cachedFragment: null,
    hasRendered: false,
    buildFragment: function buildFragment(dom) {
      var el0 = dom.createDocumentFragment();
      var el1 = dom.createTextNode(""Howdy "");
      dom.appendChild(el0, el1);
      var el1 = dom.createComment("""");
      dom.appendChild(el0, el1);
      return el0;
    },
    buildRenderNodes: function buildRenderNodes(dom, fragment, contextualElement) {
      var morphs = new Array(1);
      morphs[0] = dom.createMorphAt(fragment,1,1,contextualElement);
      dom.insertBoundary(fragment, null);
      return morphs;
    },
    statements: [

This commit looks up the attribute value from the AttrNode. This
achieves two things:

1. It uses the same normalization rules as setting, which handles props

2. It updates the `lastValue` on the AttrNode.

(2) is important because it provides a way for applications to read from
the DOM even though the normal HTMLBars model is write-only. This allows
applications to update state from the DOM, instead of vice versa, and
not cause an unnecessary write to the DOM."

```js
var layout = compile(""<p>{{yield attrs.title}}</p>"");
var template = compile(
  ""{{#component title={{title}} as |t|}}<span>{{t}}</span>{{/component}}""
);

registerHelper('component', function(params, hash) {
  this.yieldWithLayout(layout, { attrs: hash });
});

// Produces <p><span>Hello world</span></p>
template.render({ title: ""Hello world"" });
```

The functionality works for block helpers and components, and the
default hooks delegate to overridable scope management hooks to hide
the nitty gritty machinery.

Notably, this also supports idempotent re-rendering as long as the
layout itself is stable."

This commit refactors the internal scope handling of templates so that
the concept of a scope, including block parameters, is rigorous. It also
stops leaking the caller's scope into a helper call.

This commit has two primary changes:

* The internal ""scope"" is now broken up into `self` and `locals`. Block
  helpers now receive `options.template.yield`, which is used like
  `options.template.yield([ optional, block, params ])`. If block
  parameters are supplied, HTMLBars will ask the host to create a new
  scope frame, and the `locals` hash will be populated with the yielded
  parameters. It is still possible to shift the `self` by using
  `options.template.render(newSelf, [ optional, block, params ])`,
  which will always create a new scope frame. Since self-shifting
  helpers are intended to be rare, `yield` is the new path, and
  encapsulates all of the scoping details.
* Helpers and block helpers no longer receive the `self` as `this`,
  because they are intended to be analogous to functions. Functions
  do not have access to the scope of the caller O_o. Note that hooks,
  which are used by the host to implement the scoping semantics,
  of course still have access to the scope."

Now that the template is largely just a data structure that describes
its statements and expressions, the `render` function is no longer
necessary.

Instead, the runtime `render` function uses the data structure to decide
what to do. At the moment, it simply delegates to the hooks that were
already there, but the plan is to allow runtimes to completely swap out
the expression visitor to do more exotic things like building and
caching streams."

This commit makes all tests pass with the new visitor structure,
significantly shrinking the size of compiled templates and making it
possible to do re-renders without having to execute a render function.

This also means that, in theory, hooks like `inline` can know the
structure of what they're invoking before actually invoking it, allowing
implementation to do smarter caching at the ""statement"" level.

This change is honestly mostly a wonky improvement, but it does help us
avoid making as many decisions in the compiled template, deferring them
to the runtime.

There is still a decent amount of cruft left as of this commit, which we
will remove momentarily."

This change is an important step towards our efforts to offer
rerendering of an existing element, rather than creating a new
document fragment each time a template’s context changes.

In the old compiled templates, the monolithic render method did all of
the following:

1. Decide whether to use a cached fragment or build a new one from the
   build method.
2. Clone the fragment if possible / necessary
3. Create variables pointing at the fragment’s children (element0, etc.)
4. Create a bunch of pointers (morphs) with those element variables
5. Fill in the pointers (“populate”)

Because all of the “pointers” necessary to update the DOM in the future
were created as variables in the function scope, access to them was lost
as soon as the function exited.

This change is designed to make it possible to run step (4) above over
and over again on the same piece of DOM. In order to make that possible,
we changed the first few steps so that the pointers into the fragment
are returned as an array, where they can be passed into a standalone
“populate” function.

For future readers, the “pointers” into the DOM are now called
“render nodes”. These render nodes can point at either elements,
attributes, or ranges. Expect these nodes to gain more responsibilities
in the future.

We also extracted the cached fragment logic into a hook, rather than
repeating the completely static content in every template, significantly
shrinking the size of compiled templates.

The next step is to break up the `render` method into multiple pieces,
so that the part that fills in the render nodes is completely
standalone, and can be called by passing in the previous render nodes.

(We wrote down our original design that we are still more-or-less
iterating towards at https://gist.github.com/wycats/fc53be32abee6c5ca0f4.)"

This implementation entirely removes the dependency on an element’s
`childNodes` live collection. This is beneficial because:

1. IE8 required a bounds check that relied on childNodes.length, which
   in turn meant we had to
2. Implement an array-backed live collection of childNodes in simple-dom
   which is slow and error-prone, and
3. The browser just uses a linked list anyway and we were forcing *it*
   to materialize and keep updated a live collection until GC time.

This implementation just does what the browser would do anyway, while
making our simple-dom implementation actually, well, simple, and
includes notes about all of this for future fearless adventurers who
find themselves in this area of the code."

This reverts commit 8fe849220fd4c50201bd09948550ce9c110adadb.

We are reverting this change due to the potential for a performance
regression now that we loop over the children instead of accessing them
directly via the `childNodes` array.

Instead of this abstraction, we will switch to using the `NodeList#item`
API, which retains the performance benefits of `childNodes[idx]` while
being easier to implement in cases where the real DOM is not available."

Previously, child nodes were being looked up directly via an element’s

performance and our future ability to do things like diffing if we have
to precisely simulate the behavior of `childNodes`.

This commit introduces a new `childAtIndex` abstraction that allows us
to create an alternate implementation that walks a linked list instead
of assuming an array implementation."

tomdale,2014-12-24 00:37:43,https://api.github.com/repos/tildeio/htmlbars/git/commits/42371fdeff719dec8630711171cc817fb3b6564d,42371fdeff719dec8630711171cc817fb3b6564d,"Abstraction child node lookup into `childAt`

Currently, opcodes that look up child nodes are hard-coded to generate
a chain of `childNodes[idx]` lookups.

This change abstracts that lookup by adding a `childAt` method to the
DOM helper, which takes an element and an array of indices to look up.

For example, the old code:

```js
fragment.childNodes[0].childNodes[1].childNodes[0];
```

is replaced by:

```js
dom.childAt(fragment, [0, 1, 0]);
```

This change allows us to abstract child node lookup so that the elements

AST plugins allow consumers to preprocess and manipulate the AST. This
allows more efficiency in final compiled output and helps downstream

{{/each}}

Can be preprocessed and transformed into:

The HTML spec allows for ""omitted start tags"". These tags are optional
when their intended child is the first thing in the parent tag. For
example, this is a tbody start tag:

```
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
```

The tbody may be omitted, and the browser will accept and render:

```
<table>
  <tr>
```

However, the omitted start tag will still be added to the DOM. We now
test the string and context to see if the browser is about to
perform this cleanup.

http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#optional-tags
describes which tags are omittable. The spec for tbody and colgroup
explains this behavior:

http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tables.html#the-tbody-element
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tables.html#the-colgroup-element

  - Removed notion of 'sharedParent' hydration opcode in favor of the 'element' opcode
  - ConsumeParent opcode is now always added when an element is opened.
  - If the element contains more than two morphs, or if it has a handlebar embedded in the node itself, and element opcode is pushed to the hydration ast
  - When the element opcode is called, the last parent value is added to the declairations array to be cached just like morph elements before any hooks are called
  - This cached value is used when creating any morphs inside the element (like parent used to be used for) or in any element hook calls
  - By using cached elements in hook calls helpers may modify the dom all they want without messing up program execution
  - Cached elements are now stored as 'element(n)' rather than 'parent(n)'"

Template execution now requires both hooks and the dom to be passed in.
For example:

    template(context, {hooks: hooks, dom: new DOMHelper()});

Optionally, you can provide a contextualElement to the DOMHelper. This
will allow it to resolve un-escaped HTML rendering issues:

    var template = compile('{{{html}}}');
    var tableElement = document.createElement('table');
    template({html: '<tr><td>Yo</td></tr>', {
      hooks: hooks,
      dom: new DOMHelper(tableElement)
    });

When block or component hooks are called in hydration, they are passed a
DOMHelper instance with the current contextual element. This allows
templates like:

    var template = compile('<table>{{#test}}{{{html}}}{{/if}}');
    template({html: '<tr><td>Yo</td></tr>', {
      hooks: hooks,
      dom: new DOMHelper(null, document)
    });

To run properly. The `test` helper just needs to pass the env (which
contains the proper contextual element) through to the inner render.

This code also prepares htmlbars for changing namespaces based on the
AST."

This commit introduces a new hydration hook that allows HTMLBars to integrate
with web components. The hooks has the signature

   WEB_COMPONENT(placeholder, tagName, context, options, helpers)

and is generated along with a placeholder whenever the compiler encounters an
HTML element with a hyphenated tag.

Compiler changes:

- a new ComponentNode which is a mix of ElementNode and BlockNode. It has the
  signature `ComponentNode(tag, attributes, program)`.

- a new hydration opcode `component` similar to the `helper` opcode."

Attribute values are no longer represented as arrays in the AST. Instead
an attribute value is either a TextNode or MustacheNode. If the
attribute contains both text and mustache parts, they are concatenated
via the CONCAT helper. Examples:

- class=""btn-large"" parses as `text(""btn-large"")`
- class=""{{status}}"" parses as `mustache(""status"")`
- class=""btn-large {{status}}"" parses as
  `mustache(""CONCAT"", params: [string(""btn-large ""), id(""status"")])`

Consequently, the ATTRIBUTE hook no longer accepts arrays and instead
expects a value."
