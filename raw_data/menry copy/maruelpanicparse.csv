Zap out arguments expectation on go1.11 and later

Where arguments used to be listed explicitly, they are now listed as
""(...)"". This broke the unit tests.

For example with ""panic slice_str"", go1.10.8 prints:
  GOTRACEBACK=all
  panic: ([]string) (0x499cc0,0xc42000a0e0)

  goroutine 1 [running]:
  main.panicslicestr(0xc42000a0c0, 0x1, 0x2)
  (...)

whereas on go1.11beta1 the last line is:
  main.panicslicestr(...)

So I bisected Go. In this example, Go is checked out as ~/src/golang,
~/src/golang/bin is in PATH and there's a Go installation at ~/go1.4 for
bootstrapping.

  # Testing script:
  $ cat > ~/test_golang.sh <<EOF
  #!/bin/bash
  set -eu
  cd ~/src/golang/src
  ./make.bash
  go install github.com/maruel/panicparse/cmd/panic
  panic slice_str |& egrep 'main.panicslicestr\(0x'
  EOF
  $ chmod +x ~/test_golang.sh

  # Bad commit

  $ git bisect run ~/test_golang.sh

Also fix travis on go1.8.x, lock it to go1.8.7. This is because pcg
tries to install goimports, which cannot be built on go1.8.7 anymore.
