- Remove `@semantic-release/condition-travis` from the default plugins
- Verify the current branch in the core
- Verify the build is not triggered by a PR in the core
- Run in dry-run mode if not triggered on CI
- Dry-run mode runs the `verifyConditions` plugins, allowing to detect configuration error locally
- Return without error when no version has to be released due to no changes
- Return without error if the build is triggered from a PR
- Return without error if the current branch is not the configured branch
- CLI return with exit code 1 if there is a `semanticReleaseError`, allowing to fail builds in case of config error, missing token etc...

BREAKING CHANGE: `semantic-release` doesn't make sure it runs only on one Travis job anymore.
The CI configuration has to be done such that `semantic-release`
- runs only once per build
- runs only after all tests are successful on every jobs of the build
- runs on Node >=8

This can easily be done with [travis-deploy-once](https://github.com/semantic-release/travis-deploy-once).

Migration Guide

Modify your `.travis.yml` to use `travis-deploy-once`.
Replace:
```yaml
after_success:
  - npm run semantic-release
```
by:
Replace
```yaml
after_success:
  - npm install -g travis-deploy-once@4
  - travis-deploy-once ""npm run semantic-release""

Add a _Node Support Policy_ section to the project's `README.md` file

Establishing a support policy provides reassurance to the community that

providing guidance to the core maintainers, and everyone else that
contributes, the level of support they should espire to.

When the test are run npm read the ~/.npmrc and ./.npmrc files and set some environment variables starting with `npm_`.
When the test create temporary folders and created a `.npmrc` the values there are ignored as the environment variables take precedence.
This commit remove this environment variable (from the local `process.env`) before starting the integrations test and restore them after. This way the `./.npmrc` files created in temp directory for the test are correctly used."

- Do not rely on `package.json` anymore
- Use `cosmiconfig` to load the configation. `semantic-release` can be configured:
  - via CLI options (including plugin names but not plugin options)
  - in the `release` property of `package.json` (as before)
  - in a `.releaserc.yml` or `.releaserc.js` or `.releaserc.js` or `release.config.js` file
  - in a `.releaserc` file containing `json`, `yaml` or `javascript` module
- Add the `repositoryUrl` options (used across `semantic-release` and plugins). The value is determined from CLi option, or option configuration, or package.json or the git remote url
- Verifies that `semantic-release` runs from a git repository
- `pkg` and `env` are not passed to plugin anymore
- `semantic-release` can be run both locally and globally. If ran globally with non default plugins, the plugins can be installed both globally or locally.

BREAKING CHANGE: `pkg` and `env` are not passed to plugin anymore.
Plugins relying on a `package.json` must verify the presence of a valid `package.json` and load it.
Plugins can use `process.env` instead of `env`."

- `semantic-release` now verifies the plugin configuration (in the `release` property of `package.json`) and throws an error if it's invalid
- `semantic-release` now verifies each plugin output and will throw an error if a plugin returns an unexpected value.

- Run with one command and do not rely on error exit codes to stop the process when a release is not necessary
- Break `index.js` in smaller modules in order to improve testability and simplify the code
- Add several missing unit and integration tests to reach 100% coverage
- Integration tests now test end to end, including publishing to Github (with http://www.mock-server.com on Docker)
- Use `tj/commander.js` to print an help message, verify and parse CLI arguments
- Semantic-release can now be called via Javascript API: `require('semantic-release')(options)`
- Remove npmlog dependency and add more log messages
- Logger is now passed to plugins
- Add debug logs with `visionmedia/debug`. `debug` is enabled for both semantic-release and plugins with `--debug`
- Use `kevva/npm-conf` in place of the deprecated `npm/npmconf`
- Pass lastRelease, nextRelease and commits to generate-notes plugin
- In dry-run mode, print the release note instead of publishing it to Github as draft, and skip the CI verifications
- The dry-run mode does not require npm and Github TOKEN to be set anymore and can be run locally

BREAKING CHANGE: Semantic-Release must now be executed with `semantic-release` instead of `semantic-release pre && npm publish && semantic-release post`.
BREAKING CHANGE: The `semantic-release` command now returns with exit code 0 on expected exception (no release has to be done, running on a PR, gitHead not found, other CI job failed etc...). It only returns with 1 when there is an unexpected error (code error in a plugin, plugin not found, git command cannot be run etc..).
BREAKING CHANGE: Calling the `semantic-release` command with unexpected argument(s) now exit with 1 and print an help message.
BREAKING CHANGE: Semantic-Release does not rely on `npmlog` anymore and the log level cannot be configured. Debug logs can be activated with CLI option `--debug` or with environment variable `DEBUG=semantic-release:*`
BREAKING CHANGE: The CLI options `--debug` doesn't enable the dry-run mode anymore but activate the debugs. The dry run mode is now set with the CLI command `--dry-run` or `-d`."

Add several fixes and improvements in the identification of the last release gitHead:

- If git head is not present in last release, try to retrieve it from git tag with format ‘v\<version\>’ or ‘\<version\>’
- If the last release git head cannot be determined and  found in commit history, unshallow the repo and try again
- Throw a ENOGITHEAD error if the gitHead for the last release cannot be found in the npm metadata nor in the git tags, preventing to make release based on the all the commits in the repo as before
- Add integration test for the scenario with a packed repo from which `npm republish` fails to read the git head

target_commitish in GitHub Releases has two different meanings:
* Target commit that a new associated tag will be created on
* Target branch to compute how many ""commits to since this release""

target_commitish is usually the default branch (aka master), because the
distance between the release and the latest branch is the primary concern.

Before this change, target_commitish was left to be a hash and the
feature of GitHub Releases that shows how much time passed since the
release is ruined, because no tracking branch is given.

By this change, target_commitish is changed to be the default branch
given in the configuration (options.branch) via edit a release API after
the release and tag are created via crate a release API."

This commit removes babel/es6 from all source and test files, because it was introducing a lot of overhead and only little gain.
This commit fixes and enables integration tests on Travis.
This commit fixes #153 and #151 along the way.

_Originally this commit should have only removed babel, but without working tests that's a bit too hairy._
_I only realized that half way into removing babel/es6, so things are all over the place now._

You can now map dist-tags onto ""fallbackTags"". E.g. if you want a
development channel like ""next"" and no version is currently published as ""next""
semantic-release will fallback to ""latest"" to determine the new ""next"" version.
This is now the default for ""next"" -> ""latest"", but you can specify your own
mappings by adding ""fallbackTags"" to your `package.json`'s ""release"" field.

BREAKING CHANGE: In cases where you pushed a new commit with a ""dist-tag""
configuration of ""next"" and no version was previously published as ""next"",
semanitc-release failed and did not publish a new version. It will now
automatically fall back to to ""latest""."

The code to determine the last-release is now in its own repository: https://github.com/semantic-release/last-release-npm
One can overwrite that behavior by defining a ""getLastRelease"" plugin. This way
one can decouple semantic-release from npm, e.g. by implementing a git-tag
based version. This is already worked on: https://github.com/semantic-release/last-release-git-tag

Closes #56"

Removes dependency bundling, because it's broken for scoped modules with npm
right now. Keeps npm from logging four ugly warnings upon install.

This commit does a lot but it's all connected and tries to make everything more extensible and future proof.

1. CLI arguments and options from the ""package.json"" are no longer treated as two different things. You can now pass options either way.

BREAKING CHANGE: cli arguments are now normalized to camelCase, so e.g. `options['github-url']` is now `options.githubUrl`

2. Plugins no longer receive config they need one by one, but in one huge object. This way it's easier to pass more info in the future w/o breaking existing plugins that rely on the position of the callback in the arguments array.

BREAKING CHANGE: Plugins now need to read their passed options from one huge config object.

Old:
```js
module.exports = function (pluginConfig, foo, bar, cb) {…}
```

New:
```js
// ES5
module.exports = function(pluginConfig, config, cb) {
  var foo = config.foo
  var bar = config.bar
  …
}

// ES6
module.exports = function (pluginConfig, {foo, bar}, cb) {…}
```"
