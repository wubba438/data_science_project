If we keep streams in chunk sources after selecting new tracks, we also keep
a reference to a stale disabled TrackSelection object. Fix this by updating
the TrackSelection object when keeping the stream. The static part of the

When using speed adjustment it was possible for playback to get stuck at a
period transition when the channel count changed: SonicAudioProcessor would be
drained at the point of the period transition in preparation for creating a new
AudioTrack with the new channel count, but during draining the incorrect (new)
channel count was used to calculate the output buffer size for pending data from
Sonic. This meant that, for example, if the channel count changed from stereo to
mono we could have an output buffer size that stored an non-integer number of
audio frames, and in turn this would cause writing to the AudioTrack to get
stuck as the AudioTrack would prevent writing a partial audio frame.

Use Sonic's current channel count when draining output to fix the issue.

This causes problems if a specific start position is set and the later
projection after the preroll ad shouldn't take place.

The problem is solved by keeping the content position as TIME_UNSET (= default

then be resolved to its current default position if needed.

Currently, we sometimes apply new playback parameters directly and sometimes
through the list of playbackParameterCheckpoints. Only when using the checkpoints,
we also reset the offset and corresponding position for speedup position
calculation. However, these offsets need to be changed in all cases to prevent
calculation errors during speedup calculation[1].

This change channels all playback parameters changes through the checkpoints to
ensure the offsets get updated accordingly. This fixes an issue introduced in
https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/commit/31911ca54a13b0003d6cf902b95c2ed445afa930.

[1] - The speed up is calculated using the ratio of input and output bytes in
SonicAudioProcessor.scaleDurationForSpeedUp. Whenever we set new playback
parameters to the audio processor these two counts are reset. If we don't reset
the offsets too, the scaled timestamp can be a large value compared to the input
and output bytes causing massive inaccuracies (like the +20 seconds in the
linked issue).

We are currently queuing periods in a way such that the new start position
lines up with the end of the previous period (to ensure continuous playback).
However, if the start position of the new period is larger than the total of
all previously played period durations, we may end up with negative renderer
timestamps when seeking back to the beginning of this new period. Negative
timestamps should be avoided as most decoders have problems handling them
correctly.

This change forces a renderer reset if we detect such a seek to a negative
renderer time and also resets the renderer offset to 0 every time all
renderers are disabled, as this is the only time where we can savely change
the offset of an existing media period.

Also, if playback starts with an ad, we choose the content position as
renderer offset to prevent the whole issue from occurring for the seek-behind-
midroll case.

It's only thrown in an edge case on API level 20 and below. If it
is thrown it causes playback failure when playback could succeed,
by throwing up through configureCodec.

It seems better just to catch the exception and have the codec be
configured using the format's own width and height.

Accessing task providers (like javaCompileProvider) at sync time is not
possible. That's why the source sets of all generateJavadoc tasks is empty.

The set of source directories can also be accessed directly through the static
sourceSets field. Combining these allows to statically provide the relevant
source files to the javadoc task without needing to access the run-time task
provider.

as a result of DownloadThread also being used for removals.

bytes of the captioning mode.
See Chapter 7, Chapter 8.5 and Chapter 8.6 of the CEA608 Standard for
more details.

[Solution]
Drop all bytes belonging to unsupported modes.

[Test]
- All streams containing only captioning services should not be influenced
- Test all 4 CEA 608 channels with live over-the-air content and

not related to the flakiness that caused them to be disabled.
I'm re-enabling them since much has changed in DownloadManager,

Currently SimpleCache will touch cache spans whenever it reads
from them. With legacy SimpleCache setups this involves a potentially
expensive file rename. With new SimpleCache setups it involves
a more efficient but still non-free database write.

For offline use cases, and more generally any use case where the
eviction policy doesn't use last access timestamps, touching is
not useful. This change allows the evictor to specify whether it
needs cache spans to be touched or not. SimpleCache will only touch
spans if the evictor requires it.

Note: There is a potential change in behavior in cases where a
cache uses an evictor that doesn't need cache spans to be touched,
but then later switches to an evictor that does. The new evictor
may temporarily make sub-optimal eviction decisions as a result.
I think this is a very fair trade-off, since this scenario is
unlikely to occur much, if at all, in practice, and even if it
does occur the result isn't that bad.

Currently SimpleCache will touch cache spans whenever it reads
from them. With legacy SimpleCache setups this involves a potentially
expensive file rename. With new SimpleCache setups it involves
a more efficient but still non-free database write.

For offline use cases, and more generally any use case where the
eviction policy doesn't use last access timestamps, touching is
not useful. This change allows the evictor to specify whether it
needs cache spans to be touched or not. SimpleCache will only touch
spans if the evictor requires it.

Note: There is a potential change in behavior in cases where a
cache uses an evictor that doesn't need cache spans to be touched,
but then later switches to an evictor that does. The new evictor
may temporarily make sub-optimal eviction decisions as a result.
I think this is a very fair trade-off, since this scenario is
unlikely to occur much, if at all, in practice, and even if it
does occur the result isn't that bad.

This change simplified the code by

 2. Doing the subsequent seek and position update in one final step to remove

When an error occurs we call stopInternal, and this clears the MediaPeriodQueue,
which in turn releases media period holders and notifies that media periods have
been released. AnalyticsCollector updates its information about media periods
using the media period release events, which means that if we post the source
error after stopInternal posts its events we can't determine what media period
the source error corresponds to.

Move error notifications before calling stopInternal, so that
AnalyticsCollector's model of the media period queue contains the loading period
at the point when it handles the error.

For consistency also move the other (non-source) error notifications to match
the new ordering.

We currently throw if a pending seek position was valid when the user issued
it on the app thread, but can't be resolved on the playback thread because the
timeline changed in the meantime. Throwing in this case seems wrong as the
user could not have known about the issue (and the seek position was actually
valid). Also, in other cases where the currently playing period is no longer
in the new timeline, we gracefully use a subsequent period or transition to
ENDED state instead of throwing. So it seems more consistent to transition to
ENDED state as well.

Previously we would get a new AudioTrack and flush all audio processors if any
AudioProcessor needed to be flushed on reconfiguration. This was problematic for
the case of TrimmingAudioProcessor because it could become active or inactive
due to transitioning to a period with gapless metadata or without it (we don't
keep it active all the time because it is wasteful to populate its end buffer
for content that is not gapless).

This change handles the case where we don't need an AudioTrack but
AudioProcessors do need to be flushed. In this case we drain all the audio
processors when next handling data then switch to the new configuration.

This avoids truncation when period transitions change whether
TrimmingAudioProcessor is active but don't require a new AudioTrack, and is also
a step towards draining the AudioTrack when transitioning between periods if we
do need a new AudioTrack.

To do this, it needs to be possible to drain any pending output data from an
AudioProcessor after it's configured to a new format, so this change makes sure
AudioProcessors allow calling playToEndOfStream and getOutput after

We need to support serialization to/from an SQLite table. The
model of passing something around for each class to write into
doesn't work well for SQL, and it would be messy to have two
different structural designs for serialization. This change
centralizes the logic in CachedContentIndex, where a centralized
SQL based version can more easily sit alongside it.

1. The method kept track of the current period index to check if the next
period is still in the correct period. This is unneccessary since we no longer
use the period index but the actual uid in MediaPeriodId and mismatches are
already detected by canKeepMediaPeriodHolder.
2. We updated the MediaPeriodIndfo twice: once in getFollowingMediaPeriodInfo
and once in getUpdatedMediaPeriodInfo. That's confusing and difficult to
follow. The only difference is that getUpdatedMediaPeriodInfo keeps the
content position while getFollowingMediaPeriodInfo resets it. This is made more
explicit for readability.
3. The durations compatibility check for all following periods was broken as
it compared the same durations (partly due to the confusion caused by 2.)

[Solution]
Set an additional flag when any data is processed. Control code
duplication checks should be limited only for the first control
byte pairs processed after any control code.

presumably due to caching in the file system, however are still

CacheEvictor.onStartFile currently receives a length, which is the
maximum size of the content that might be written. The LRU cache
evictor will make sure there's sufficient space for the specified
size. If the actual size of the content is unknown, CacheDataSink
passes maxCacheFileSize.

The current behavior isn't ideal. It seems valid for a developer to
specify maxCacheFileSize=Long.MAX_VALUE if they don't want any
file fragmentation in the cache. However if they then attempt to
cache something with unknown length, LRU cache will try and make
room for content of length Long.MAX_VALUE, and end up evicting the
entire cache to do so.

This change alters the logic so a length is only passed if the
actual size of the content is known. In other cases C.LENGTH_UNSET
is now passed. The LRU evictor will not evict until after the file
is committed. Note a custom LRU evictor could still opt to evict to
ensure some application specified amount of space, if that's the
desired behavior.

Problem: There is nothing in the Cache interface that enforces that
these methods are implemented by reading/writing content metadata,
however our own code (CacheDataSource) relies on this property since
it mixes use of [get|set]ContentLength and use of metadata. Using
metadata is the right approach because it minimizes the number of
index writes (e.g. it allows the redirect URI and the content length
to be committed by a single write).

Solution: Remove [get|set]ContentLength, which are redundant anyway,
and use metadata everywhere. Also expose the keys being used through
the public API; there's no particular reason why they shouldn't be.
We previously had an API for getting and setting content length, but
no API for getting and setting redirect uri.

[Problem]
As the alignment of each lineas are calculated individually, the
artificially introduced CENTER and RIGHT alignments can be mixed
with each other and with the default LEFT alignment. The mixed results
look worse than just using the original DEFAULT, and the readability
is radically decreased.

[Solution]
Pre-calculate the alignment for each line, and use the leftmost of them
for all lines. The intention of caption provider could be different, but
the worst case scenario is that we revert back everything to LEFT
alignment that is the only option in the CEA608 standard so we
show everything at the exact location it is set in the content.
The readability is never worse than the one given by the content
provider.

[Test]
This should influence CEA608 pop-up cations only. (Not roll up).
Test various live channels with this change.
Note: Beginning of commercials tend to have PAINT-ON mode as that
is immediately showing incoming characters, not just at the end
of the line like POP-on mode."

We currently default to not caching data if the content length
cannot be resolved once the DataSource has been open. The
reason for this is to avoid caching progressive live streams.
By doing this we were accidentally not caching in other places
where caching is possible, such as DASH/SS/HLS segments during
playback if the server doesn't include a Content-Length header.
Also HLS encryption key chunks, which were very unlikely to be
cached during playback because we explicitly set FLAG_ALLOW_GZIP
(which normally stops content length from resolving) without
setting FLAG_ALLOW_CACHING_UNKNOWN_LENGTH.

It seems like a good idea to flip the default at this point,
and explicitly disable caching in the one case where we want
that to happen.

[Problem]
PAINT-ON mode is not implemented. From the compliance tests:
* RDC command has no effect except to select paint-on style.
* Next data are written directly to the display upon receipt.
* If other captioning is already on the screen, the four-row
limit is still in effect.

[Solution]
It is a rare use case, we do not support overriding characters in
existing cueBuilders as PAINT-ON would require. But several
compliance tests check if the screen is cleared when the mode
switch happens. We must keep the old captions when switching
to PAINT-ON mode

[Test]
- Live Over-the-Air content, beginning of commercials often uses

This change will upgrade existing action files gracefully (i.e. it does not
lose compatibility with the existing offline implementation, other than some
minor breaking changes to the API).

TODOs:

1. Move test methods from the XDownloadActionTest classes into DownloadActionTest.
   This will be done in a subsequent CL. There's a lot of consolidation that can
   be done here, including de-duplicating some of the test code added in this CL.
2. Look at merging DownloaderConstructorHelper into DefaultDownloaderFactory.

It's no longer guaranteed that onOutputFormatChanged will always be
called when the renderer is re-enabled, since the codec may be kept
and its output format may not change. Hence we need to avoid resetting

Currently, MediaCodecRenderer's render loop does not have any time limit. We
always try to drain and feed as much buffers as possible. This may lead to a
pattern of feeding phase takes too much time from previous loop, which makes
the next draining phase drops all buffers, making these buffers available for
feeding all at once, and the pattern keeps repeating.

This CL adds an experimental parameter for setting a time limit. If the time
limit is exceeded, the feeding process stops even if more input could be fed.
The default behavior is unchanged

Before this change, the player state would be STATE_ENDED then
STATE_BUFFERING (when the postroll ad was marked as played) then
STATE_ENDED again.

Queueing a final content media period with start point equal to
the content duration after a postroll ensures that the player
state doesn't change to STATE_ENDED transiently.

Switch from using C.TIME_END_OF_SOURCE to C.TIME_UNSET for media
periods that should not have an end point and are not followed
by an ad.

Content media periods before postrolls have end position
C.TIME_END_OF_SOURCE. If the postroll ad loads, its content
position is set to the content duration, which should be known
at the point of loading the postroll, then a final 'empty'
content media period with start position equal to its duration
is queued. If the postroll fails to load, this empty content
media period is queued up directly after the preceding content
media period.

There are multiple subtle issues with the current implementation:

1. setOperatingRate can cause a codec initialization even if the
   renderer is disabled. This is not supposed to happen.
2. If the codec is released whilst the renderer is disabled, the
   renderer can instantiate a new codec using the old format when
   it's enabled again, only to immediately have to reconfigure or
   release it if the actual format to be played is different.
3. Codec reuse does not take into account renderer configuration.
   The specific case where this is problematic is if the video
   renderer is re-enabled with a different tunneling session id.
   The reused codec is then not configured correctly.

Also moved availableCodecInfos reset into releaseCodec for sanity.

If we prepare a deferred media period before the actual timeline is available,
we either prepare with position zero (= the default) or with a non-zero
initial seek position.

So far, the zero (default) position got replaced by the actual default position
(including any potential non-zero window offset) when the timeline became known.

However, a non-zero initial seek position was not corrected by the non-zero
window offset. This is fixed by this change.

Related to that, we always assumed that the deferred media period will the
first period in the actual timeline. This is not true if we prepare with an
offset (either because of an initial seek position or because of a default
window position). So, we also determine the actual first period when the
timeline becomes known.

I don't think there's any particular reason for releasing
dummySurface when we release the codec. It seems to make
more sense to decouple the two, and treat a dummySurface as
a resource that should be released on reset.

setSurface only sets the output surface on the codec if the
renderer is enabled or started. This was fine in the past
because the codec was always null in other states, however
the recent codec reuse work means this is no longer the case.

The output surface should always be set if the codec is
non-null. If setting the surface requires releasing the codec
instance, we should only instantiate the new instance if
enabled or started. This is in line with what onDisabled does
if flushing requires releasing the codec

For decoder reuse, we want disable() to flush the decoder. However,
if the flush needs to release the decoder for some reason, it seems
non-ideal to immediately re-initialize it. Re-initialization can
also throw ExoPlaybackException, which we don't want for disabling.

This change allows a variant of flush that wont re-initialize the
decoder if it has to be released, which will be used from disable().

we forward the position relative to the parent of SubtitleView. That causes

If we prepare a deferred media period before the actual timeline is available,
we either prepare with position zero (= the default) or with a non-zero
initial seek position.

So far, the zero (default) position got replaced by the actual default position
(including any potential non-zero window offset) when the timeline became known.

However, a non-zero initial seek position was not corrected by the non-zero
window offset. This is fixed by this change.

Related to that, we always assumed that the deferred media period will the
first period in the actual timeline. This is not true if we prepare with an
offset (either because of an initial seek position or because of a default
window position). So, we also determine the actual first period when the
timeline becomes known.

These two methods are meant to indicate to the track selection that it's
started or stopped being used. This is helpful to schedule background tasks
related to track selection (e.g. register network change listeners etc.).
This intention is not clearly stated in the method docs.

Also, all track selections of all prebuffered periods stay enabled in
parallel at the moment. As the whole purpose of these methods is to know
whether dynamic updates via updateSelectedTrack may happen, it's better to
only enable track selections of the current loading media period. That's
similar to how we always forward the loading track selections to the
LoadControl.

This change:
 1. Improves the JavaDoc of TrackSelection.
 2. Disables track selections if loading moves to another period.
 3. Reenables track selection if loading moves back to a previous period.

Before this change we would reset the start trim to zero after initial
configuration (at the start of playback) and after seeking to any position. The
fact that no trimming was applied at the start of playback meant that after the
first period transition we'd see a mismatch between the next buffer timestamp
(equal to the duration of the period taking into account edits) and the duration
of audio submitted to the sink.

This change modifies the behavior so that we reset the start trim to zero only
if some audio was queued since configuration. This is incorrect in the case of
starting playback at a non-zero position, but fixes the common case of starting
at zero. As before, a later seek to any position is handled via a flush and
resets the trim as required.

Transitions from one period to the next are unaffected by this change.

One way to implement start trimming correctly would be to provide the input
buffer timestamp to the audio processors and only trim when handling audio from
the start of the stream, but that is a larger change so left for later.

The current structure tries to associate events to media periods and windows

The recent changes to MediaPeriodId allow to use it as a unique identifer for
media periods independent of the timeline. This enables more accurate tracking
of the media period queue and prevents reporting events with inconsistent

the system's AudioManager and an AudioFocusConfiguration to
SimpleExoPlayer.setAudioFocusConfiguration.

Currently, MetadataRetrieverImpl uses MediaCodecVideoRenderer to renderering

- MediaCodecVideoRenderer has a lot of logic to time frame release, including
drop frames if late or try to keep up with feeding speed etc... These are not
necessary at all for frame retrieval.
- MediaCodecVideoRenderer always tries to render 1 frame after video surface
update. This may some times lead to the wrong image being rendered for

releases, and only render first frame after position reset / renderer

For background on why doing this works, see below. I don't want to change
how we get our Cipher instance in non-test code, since PKCS7 always works
on Android. It's only when the tests are running on a non-Android host
machine that they can fail. An alternative would be to make it an androidTest,
but androidTests are slow.

------

Background:

""While Java considers PKCS5 and PKCS7 padding to be the ""same"" (and
one should always use the string ""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"" because
""AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding"" will cause NoSuchAlgorithmException to be thrown
when initializing an AES block cipher using the Java crypto API), I
consider this a gross misnaming in the Java platform because the pure
technical definitions of these paddings are not the same.""

This helps to distinguish between the MediaPeriodId the deferred media period is being

1. The error reporting of ad prepare errors uses the correct media period id (the
   externally visible ad media period id).
2. The transition to using media period uid instead of indices is simplified.

While the timeline is empty, we keep a dummy MediaPeriodId in PlaybackInfo with
a period index of 0. We leak this MediaPeriodId in actual use in these
situations:
 1. When issuing an IllegalSeekPosition after preparation. The timeline becomes
    non-empty, but the media period id stays at its dummy value.
 2. When re-adding sources to a previously empty timeline. The dummy period id
    is used as the start position for the new non-empty timeline.

This change makes:
 - the constructor of PlaybackInfo using those dummy values more explicit
 - prevents the issues above by using the correct default position in the new
   non-empty timeline for the above mentioned cases.

streams from one type to another (for example embedded to primary).

This change restructures the track selection to:
1. Release and reset all streams that need to be released or replaced.
 1(a). Including embedded orphan streams.
2. Select new streams.

MediaDrm.provideXResponse methods only accept the response
corresponding to the most recent MediaDrm.getXRequest call.
Previously, our code allowed the following incorrect call
sequence:

a = getKeyRequest
b = getKeyRequest
provideKeyResponse(responseFor(a));

This would occur in the edge case of a second key request
being triggered whilst the first was still in flight. The
provideKeyResponse call would then fail.

This change fixes the problem by treating responseFor(a)
as stale. Note that a slightly better fix would be to
defer calling getKeyRequest the second time until after
processing the response corresponding to the first one,
however this is significantly harder to implement, and is
probably not worth it for what should be an edge case.

MediaDrm.provideXResponse methods only accept the response
corresponding to the most recent MediaDrm.getXRequest call.
Previously, our code allowed the following incorrect call
sequence:

a = getKeyRequest
b = getKeyRequest
provideKeyResponse(responseFor(a));

This would occur in the edge case of a second key request
being triggered whilst the first was still in flight. The
provideKeyResponse call would then fail.

This change fixes the problem by treating responseFor(a)
as stale. Note that a slightly better fix would be to
defer calling getKeyRequest the second time until after
processing the response corresponding to the first one,
however this is significantly harder to implement, and is
probably not worth it for what should be an edge case.

Codec initialization may fail in creation, configuration or when start()ing the
codec. If codec initialization fails, there may be other codecs available that
could handle the same format, but currently ExoPlayer can only try to use the
first listed codec for the input format and gives up if it fails to initialize.

This change implements support for optionally falling back to alternative
decoders if initialization fails. MediaCodecSelector can now return a list of
decoders to try in priority order, and use the Format when choosing a codec.
With the default implementation, the codecs and order come from MediaCodecList,
and matches the order used internally by MediaCodec.createDecoderByType (which
implements the same kind of fallback though only to the creation step, without
configuring/starting the codec).

This feature is useful for apps that want to play several videos concurrently on
devices that have software decoders (like OMX.google.h264.decoder), as the new
behavior allows new codecs to be created when no hardware-accelerated decoders
are available.

The list of available codecs is queried when initializing the codec after a
format change that requires a new codec to be instantiated. When a decoder fails
to initialize it is removed from the list of available decoders and won't be
tried again until the next format change (or until the renderer is disabled).

Note: this change does not affect the renderer capabilities API, as when
checking format support we don't know which codec will be used.

some TS streams only have track format at the begining of the stream, and reseting
the payload readers after seeking can lead to track format not available anymore.

This change reverts the original fix (do not discard TS PES payload readers on seek
anymore). Instead, in non-HLS mode, after we have processed all PMTs packets in
the strea, we will re-seek to the beginning and perform readin again to make sure
the result will be consistent across multiple seeks. This is a prepare step to
support seeking in TS streams.

Original change by nickchavez@nickchavez:andcsvol:3257:citc on 2018/06/19 12:41:18.

Add VolumeProvider interface to VideoAdPlayer and VideoStreamPlayer.
  - Send volume on videoDisplay.start so that it can be sent to OMID.
  - Add unit tests for AdPlayerCalback and ExoPlayerVideoAdPlayerImpl.
  - Add functional tests for client side and DAI volume updates.

Add onVolumeChanged() to VideoAdPlayerCallback and VideoStreamPlayerCallback.
  - Implement volume updates for SDK owned video player.
  - Remove mute/unmute events, which are handled in JS instead (like iOS).
  - Collect volume changes from client side and DAI video players.

External: Publisher players will now have to implement getVolume() and onVolumeChanged() for custom video players.

Currently, we are using 2 copy steps for PixelCopySurfaceCapturerV24:
- Copy from the source surface to a similarly sized bitmap (using PixelCopy API).
- Copy from the bitmap to a scaled bitmap, based on the given output size, using scaledBitmap API.
This CL merges the 2 steps and uses PixelCopy API to perform copy directly from
the source surface to the bitmap of the given output size.
However, since our test uses scaledBitmap API to create reference bitmap from original image, due to various Bitmap copy optimizations (filtering, antialiasing etc...) that are different between PixelCopy API and scaledBitmap API implementations, the result images cannot be the same. We can perform the our tests by asserting that their PSNR value is very high, which means they are very similar.

MediaPeriod will still not be eligible for GC, but the
player and application activity will be, which in most
cases will be most of the leak (in terms of size).

When the player state is changed from an event listener callback, we may
get recursive listener notifications. These recursions can produce a wrong

different listeners.

This change serializes listener notifications by clustering all update data
in a helper data class and adding the updates to a queue which can be handled
in a loop on the outer layer of the recursion.

As playWhenReady updates also reference the current playbackInfo, we need to
redirect the listener notifcations for setPlayWhenReady to the same queue.

This type of flicker was visible (at least on my S8) whenever starting

the intent, and only applies the show-notification-on-stop hack if it
was. It's only necessary to start as foreground if your app is not already
in the foreground, so it's not necessary to do this from activity/ui

LibFlac internally can skip ID3 tags correctly. Therefore, we don't need to keep track of the whole ID3 header section and skip through this section in Java code. We can just set the whole stream to the native library, and it will handle skipping ID3 tags correctly.

The only thing that the Java part need to do is peeking and parsing ID3 tags (if present), in order to populate the track format metadata.

Currently, pending stream offset changes are kept until an output buffer
timestamp surpasses the next pending stream offset. However, this is
problematic if the next stream offset overlaps with the current output
buffer sample times (e.g. because the next stream starts at a non-zero start
time).

To correctly time the switch to the next stream offset, this change keeps
the timestamp of the last queued input sample as switch point. And we only
switch to the new offset after an output sample timestamp reached this switch
point.

In MatroskaExtractor TrueHD audio samples are joined into larger chunks. For
some streams the resulting chunked samples seem never to start with a syncframe.
This could result in playback of TrueHD streams getting stuck after seeking
because we could never read a syncframe at the start of a sample to determine
the sample size.

Instead of expecting to find a syncframe at the start of a sample, search for it
within the sample, to fix this issue.

Note: this means that we may search a few thousand bytes to find the sample
size, but the cost is only incurred for the first audio sample read.

Previously the SonicAudioProcessor and SilenceSkippingAudioProcessor would track
their pending playback parameters and only apply them in flush(). Having the
values only take effect once flushed made the processors a bit more difficult to
use, especially because the value returned by isActive wouldn't update
immediately.

Make DefaultAudioSink only set the new speed/pitch/skip silence setting after
the audio processors have drained. This means it's no longer necessary to keep
track of pending parameter values and also fixes a bug where initial playback
parameters weren't applied because the audio processors weren't flushed while
uninitialized before DefaultAudioSink called isActive() on them.

Video renderers assume that the player position is advancing linearly while in
the started state. MediaCodecVideoRenderer schedules frames for rendering in the
future in the expectation that the player position is advancing.

This assumption is not currently true when using a position from the AudioTrack:
the player position can be fixed for (in the worst case) up to about 100 ms
before it starts increasing. This leads to an effect where the first frame is
rendered then a few other frames are rendered, then there's a pause before
frames start being rendered smoothly.

Work around this issue by checking whether the position has started advancing
before scheduling frames to be rendered in the future.

It might be preferable to make the audio renderer only become ready when its
timestamp can start advancing, but this is likely to be complicated.

In audio processors an audio frame consists of a sample (which is 2 bytes for

We've already diverged from the original source for Sonic quite a bit (deleting
code and making stylistic changes) and there haven't been upstream changes so
far, so it seems fine to start making more substantial changes here.

This change is being made as a precursor to a subsequent change
where creating the TrackSelectorResult will move from
MappingTrackSelector to DefaultTrackSelector. DefaultTrackSelector
doesn't currently have access to the un-mapped tracks, and so is

keep it that way rather than passing them down just so they can

DefaultAudioSink had a lot of code related to tracking the position of the
underlying AudioTrack, and working around issues with the position APIs.

Move this code to a separate class responsible for position tracking. This is in
preparation for improving the audio timestamp polling behavior.

This change is intended not to cause any behavior changes.

When creating a new AC-3 passthrough AudioTrack the position
may advance from an old AudioTrack's position. The workaround
checked for the playback head position returning to zero, but
a subsequent change meant that we'd always start writing data
to the new track immediately (rather than waiting for its
position to 'stabilize' at zero).

Fix the issue by using the AudioTrack position directly. (Nb.
this doesn't handle the case of the stale position before
unwrapping being zero, but it is very unlikely to occur.)

Up to now we use a boolean ""preventListenerNotification"" to suppress updates
while other operations are still in progress. This ensures, for example, that
only one initial timeline is issued even for multiple child sources.

As soon as we allow to reuse the same instance, it becomes increasingly difficult
to manage this manual listener notification suppression. Therefore, this change
schedules an update as a new message on the playback thread immediately after the
current message. This way, we also ensure that all simultaneous updates within one
looper message iteration are reported together.

If an exception is thrown in an IMA callback it crashes the process with lots of
logging from WebView (including several stack traces, etc.). This change wraps
ImaAdsLoader code that might throw, skips any remaining ads (as the errors are
not recoverable, in general) and notifies a new load error callback so that the
application can implement its own handling. The intention is to make the loader
robust to unexpected requests from IMA and avoid crashes.

Also handle IMA loading an ad in an ad group that has no available ads. In rare
cases IMA will try to load an ad for which an error was previously notified, so
this drops those load requests allowing playback of the content to continue.

All media periods are part of a queue of windows buffered and played by

Releasing the player released the internal playback thread once renderers were

Release on the loading thread instead of the playback thread. This avoids
needing to block releasing the player until the loading threads have ended, and
ensures that release tasks will run eventually. As part of this change,
ExtractorMediaPeriod's call to Extractor.release will now run on the loading

requests resuming content but we never managed to start playing an ad).

group load errors. This ensures we skip the right ad group if we notify IMA of
playback errors for every ad in the ad group, then IMA notifies that the ad
group is empty via a load error.

- Avoid warning about unexpected ad group indices more than once.
- Output a warning if the ad count in an ad group decreases.
- Remove unnecessary assertion.
- Fix getting the ad duration for ad indices that haven't loaded yet.
- Allow setting an ad group state to its current value.
- Fix javadoc for setting the ad resume position.

logging from WebView (including several stack traces, etc.). This change wraps
ImaAdsLoader code that might throw, skips any remaining ads (as the errors are

application can implement its own handling. The intention is to make the loader
robust to unexpected requests from IMA and avoid crashes.

Also handle IMA loading an ad in an ad group that has no available ads. In rare
cases IMA will try to load an ad for which an error was previously notified, so
this drops those load requests allowing playback of the content to continue.

All media periods are part of a queue of windows buffered and played by
ExoPlayer. When repeating windows, the current MediaPeriodId is insufficient
to distinguish between the repetitions of the same period. This makes it hard
to see to which media period load events belong to, and it is also difficult to
determine whether two media periods belong to the same logical window or
whether they are part of different repetitions of the same window.

Therefore this change adds a unique sequence number to each window in the
sequence of windows and this sequence number is saved as part of the
MediaPeriodId.

Releasing the player released the internal playback thread once renderers were

Release on the loading thread instead of the playback thread. This avoids
needing to block releasing the player until the loading threads have ended, and
ensures that release tasks will run eventually. As part of this change,
ExtractorMediaPeriod's call to Extractor.release will now run on the loading
thread (which means that all Extractor methods are called on that thread) and
other cleanup in ReleaseCallback will run on the loading thread instead of the

Allow skipping an ad group when requested by IMA, even if we aren't currently

requests resuming content but we never managed to start playing an ad).

Use the known ad group index (rather than the expected one) when handling ad
group load errors. This ensures we skip the right ad group if we notify IMA of
playback errors for every ad in the ad group, then IMA notifies that the ad
group is empty via a load error.

- Avoid warning about unexpected ad group indices more than once.
- Output a warning if the ad count in an ad group decreases.
- Remove unnecessary assertion.
- Fix getting the ad duration for ad indices that haven't loaded yet.
- Allow setting an ad group state to its current value.

- This will bring back the possibility of getting stuck in the

- This gives LoadControl enough information in shouldContinueLoading
  to know whether returning false will result in a terminal non-playback
  state.
- DefaultLoadControl will always return true when returning false will
  result in a terminal non-playback state, unless the target buffer size
  is exceeded. This can help to avoid getting stuck in the case that a
  MediaPeriod is providing samples from an unexpected starting time.
- Make the terminal state actually terminal. Previously the player would
  end up in an indefinite buffering state. We now fail with an error.
- Also remove the opportunity for LoadControl implementations to livelock
  playback. No sane LoadControl should simultaneously tell the player that
  it doesn't want to load anything and that it doesn't want to start
  playback. So this change removes the opportunity and starts playback in
  EPII instead in this case.

So far this wasn't possible because Robolectric's Looper and MessageQueue
implementations have multiple shortcomings:
 1. The message loop of new HandlerThreads is an not an actual loop and
    scheduled messages are executed on the thread the message is enqueued
    (not the handler thread).
 2. The scheduler used to replace the message queue is synchronizing all its
    methods. Thus, when a test attempts to add messages to a Handler from
    two different threads, it may easily run into a deadlock.
 3. The scheduler doesn't correctly emulate the order of messages as they
    would be in an actual MessageQueue:
   a. If the message is enqueued on the handler thread, it gets executed
      immediately (and not after all other messages at the same time).
   b. The list of messages is always re-sorted by time, meaning that the
      order of execution for messages at the same time is indeterminate.
 4. Robolectric's SystemClock implementation returns the current scheduler
    time of the main UI thread. So, unless this scheduler is used to add
    messages in the future, the SystemClock time never advances.

This CL adds two helper classes which extend and replace Robolectric's
ShadowLooper and ShadowMessageQueue.
 1. We intercept messages being enqueued or deleted in the message queue.
    Thus Robolectric's faulty scheduler gets never used. Instead, we keep
    a blocking priority queue of messages, sorted first by execution time
    and then by FIFO order to correctly emulate the real MessageQueue.
 2. We also keep a list of deleted messages to know which messages to ignore
    when they come up in the looper.
 3. When a new Looper is started, we override the dummy loop to an actual
    eternal while loop which waits for new messages, checks if they haven't
    been deleted, and runs the messages (similar to what Robolectric's
    MessageQueue would have done at this point).

Because we don't actually use the main UI thread in our tests, we can't rely
on the SystemClock to progress in any sensible manner. To overcome this issue,
we can use the auto-advancing FakeClock also used for the simulation tests.

is called from a different thread than prepareSource and both access local
variables without synchronization.
2. For multi-window playback, the FakeRenderer claims that isReady and isEnded
are both set to false if it read the end of the stream. However isReady should be
true because it is able to ""render"" its data until the end of the stream.

This fixes a very specific case where the data read has non-cached gaps
and a read-only CDS switches to read from upstream in a gap then the
cached data is deleted. When the CDS reaches the end of the gap, it
tries to open the next source. As there is no cached data, it tries to
continue with the already opened upstream data source but as it reached
end of the gap range, the code starts looping.

Also fixes infinite lock which occurs when in the previous case CDS isn't
readonly. It locks the content while filling the gap in the cache. At the
end of the gap, as the following data is deleted it tries to lock the
content for writing but the content is already locked by itself.

The last fix is preventing removal of CachedContent entry from
CachedContentIndex while associated key is locked.

while the player is actively playing media (playWhenReady=true). Due to the
indeterminate time taken to enqueue the commands on the playback thread, they
may arrive when the player already proceeded to another window or finished
playback.

To ensure the tests are always deterministic, this change pauses playback in
the tests where this may happen before issuing the commands.
Also, for tests where we need to wait for a new window before issuing the
next command, a new action is added which allows to play until a specified

If ClippingMediaSource contains a child MediaSource with embedded metadata

ClippingMediaSource not be able to stop after the clipping end point. The
reason being the metadata stream cannot read anymore sample, but it's also not

Whilst the previous behavior was WAI and had the advantage of
updating the position to be more exact when known, there were
a couple of disadvantages:

1. If seeking to the very end of a period in a playlist when
   paused, the position adjustment could trigger a position
   discontinuity to the next period.
2. We de-duplicate seeks to the current playback position.
   The position adjustment can prevent this from being
   effective. This is particularly important with the new
   SeekParameters support. When seeking to nearest sync point
   it's often possible to de-duplicate seeks, but we cannot
   do so if the playback position adjusts away from the sync
   point's time.

This is a no-op change replacing the local variables in ExoPlayerImplInternal
with the new ones in PlaybackInfo.

***
Use playbackState, isLoading and trackSelectorResult from playbackInfo in ExoPlayerImpl.

***
Move duplicated listener notification in ExoPlayerImpl to new method.

Also split reset method in one parts which creates the new playback info
and one part which notifies the listeners. The increment of the pending
operation counter needs to happen in between.

***
Use only one pending operation counter in ExoPlayerImpl.

This also allows to move onSeekProcessed into the notification chain.

***
Replace playback info changing messages to ExoPlayerImpl by single message type.

As they are all handled in the same way, they can be summarized to one message.

***
Only send playback info change notifications once per playback thread message.

This ensures that all concurrent changes actually reach ExoPlayerImpl concurrently.

The set of active audio processors was only updated on reconfiguration and when
draining playback parameters completed. Draining playback parameters are cleared
in reset(), so if parameters were set while paused then the sink was quickly
reset, without draining completing, the set of active audio processors wouldn't
be updated. This means that a switch to or from speed or pitch = 1 would not be
handled correctly if made while paused and followed by a seek.

Move resetting active audio processors from configure (where if the active audio
processors were reset we'd always initialize a new AudioTrack) to initialize().

Until recently, changing primary track formats were reported when the

after the sample has been read.

Now, media chunks may be discarded later on or in batches, leaving the
current reporting mechanism broken because changes may never be reported.

This fix separates the discarding from the reporting such that format changes
can be reported when the media chunk is first read from, while the discarding
operation only discards without reporting format changes.

different reasons why it's being called. Especially, finding
out whether a new media source has been prepared or the current source

The new reasons provide this disdinction by either indicating a newly

or manifest, or a reset of the player (which usually results in an
empty timeline).

Currently for a DASH ChunkSource that consists of multiple sub-streams, we
always use a CompositeSequenceableLoader, which only allows the furthest behind
loader or any loader that are behind current playback position to continue
loading.
This changes allow clients to have more flexibility when deciding the loading
strategy:
- They can construct a different kind of composite SequenceableLoader from
the sub-loaders, and use it by injecting a different CompositeSequeableLoaderFactory accordingly.

This change makes sure progress is being made before reporting
a discontinuity. Else in cases like having no network and
playing a live stream, we allow the discontinuity to be read
each time an internal retry occurs, meaning it gets read
repeatedly. This does no harm, but is noisy and unnecessary.

We should also not allow skipping whilst there is a pending
reset or discontinuity notification, just like we don't allow
reads.

This is a step toward retaining a back-buffer in a way that
works for all MediaSource implementations. It's not possible
to adjust the discardBuffer calls in ExoPlayerImplInternal
to discard up to (position - backBufferDurationUs). Next steps
are to:

1. Find an appropriate place to specify the back buffer value,
   to be passed to the discardBuffer calls. I guess the
   LoadControl is the appropriate place to define such values.
2. Enhance discardBuffer to support a toKeyframe argument to

Now we have multiple streams the check doesn't do the right thing,

Until that API is changed, i.e., pulled into GMSCore, and most clients are using the version of GMSCore with the API change, we can stick with this approach.

Cronet generally uses the original headers on redirect:

1. Move Timeline/Manifest into PlaybackInfo
2. Don't update externally visible Timeline/Manifest during preparation
3. Ignore MSG_POSITION_DISCONTINUITY during preparation
4. Correctly set masking variables at start of preparation, and use them

Once this change goes in, PlaybackInfo will contain timeline, manifest
and position, which should always be self-consistent with one another.
The next step would then be to move a bunch of logic in ExoPlayerImpl
that derives state from timeline and position into PlaybackInfo, and
split that into its own top level class that can be easily tested to make
sure it never IndexOutOfBounds.

I think we could also replace the masking variables and instead just assign
a new PlaybackInfo to the playbackInfo variable whenever we're doing
something that requires masking. This should be possible because we no
longer update playbackInfo whenever we have pending acks. It would
require allowing PlaybackInfo to mask the window position internally when
the timeline is empty, but I think this is ok, and again is something we
could test pretty easily.

MobileHarness allocates random devices for each test and repeats tests up to 5 times to
account for spurious test failures. Some of our tests automatically pass for SDK versions
below a certain threshold. Thus, even if such a version-guarded test would always fail,
the MobileHarness test is likely to succeed as it only needs one random allocation to a
device with a lower SDK version.

To prevent this behaviour and to make sure all tests are actually run, the mobile_test
target is split into multiple targets one for each minimum SDK version.

This change fixes various issues:
 - MobileHarness sometimes allocated devices with SDK < 16. As we have no tests running
   on these SDKs, a new dimension filter for the mobile_test target ensures that only
   devices with SDK >= 16 are selected. A similar filter for SDK version is also added
   to the ABR playback tests to ensure no old devices are selected.
 - DRM specific tests are skipped for Api < 18, but were not able to run because the
   DashTestRunner class tried to link to the MediaDrm constructor. Moved the
   constructor to a seperate Builder class to allow execution on Api levels 16 and 17.
 - DashWidevineOfflineTest also tried to access code for Api >= 18 without checking
   the current level.
 - Action implementations which are waiting for events did not ensure that they have a
   nextAction to wait for. This caused NullPointerExceptions when this next action was
   scheduled.
 - DefaultDrmSession always restored the offline keys when a new license was requested,
   even if the keys were already restored. These repeated slow calls to restoreKeys
   resulted in high numbers of dropped buffers.

By default, if a codec is instantiated during an ongoing
playback, ExoPlayer will render the first frame that it
receives (so that there's ""something other than black""
drawn to the surface). This frame is the key-frame before
the current playback position, and may be as much as 5
seconds behind the current position. ExoPlayer then drops
subsequent frames that are late until it's caught up to
the current position again.

For GTS tests that are counting dropped frames, this is
not desirable behavior, since it will cause spurious test
failures in cases where DummySurface is not supported.
This change overrides the default behavior so that the
player instead skips (rather than drops) frames until it's
caught up to the current playback position, and only then
renders the first frame.

Currently our Renderer is always associated with and consume data from

There are use-cases, in which the users want to have simple Renderer
implementation that does not consume data from SampleStream at all, but
render using their custom logic at each rendering position - they mostly just
need ExoPlayer to keep track of the playback position and enable/disable the
renderer.
This CL adds support for such Renderer by adding a TRACK_TYPE_NONE.

- Associated with null TrackSelection as the result of track-selection
operation.
- Associated with EmptySampleStream.

The sleep used to simulate data load times is ignoring InterruptedExceptions.
(This is intended and in line with SystemClock.sleep()). However, when a
Loader cancels an ongoing load, it uses interrupts. To be able to catch these
and to immediately return from the reading data source, a handler callback
is used instead of the sleep() method which allows interuptable waiting.

Remaining instrumentation tests either use android.os.Handler or rely on assets.
In the latter case, the tests are difficult to migrate due to differences
between the internal and external build systems, and configuration needed in
Android Studio. In addition, SimpleCacheSpanTest remains as an instrumentation
test because it fails due to a problem with string encoding on the internal
build (and two other tests in its package are kept with it because they depend
on it).

This test removes a dependency from testutils on Mockito, as a different
version of Mockito needs to be used for instrumentation tests vs Robolectric
tests, yet both sets of tests need to rely on testutils. Mockito setup is now
done directly in the tests that need it.

Move OggTestData to testutils so it can be used from both instrumentation and
Robolectric tests.

It may be possible to simplify assertions further using Truth but this is left
for possible later changes.

Currently FlacDecoder/FlacExtractor always perform resampling to 16bit. In some
case (with 24bit audio), this might lower the audio quality if the system
supports 24bit audio.
Since AudioTrack implementation supports resampling, we will remove the
resampling step, and return an output with the same bits-per-sample as the original stream.
User can choose to re-sample to 16bit in AudioTrack if necessary.

responsibility to stop to the test itself which has better control over the
stop condition.

Currently the ExoPlayerWrapper is used to run tests using an ExoPlayer
implementation. Some properties of the test are set in the constructor, some
are set by overloading the class, others are hard-coded in the
ExoPlayerWrapper class, and a mechanism similar to the existing ActionSchedule
is missing.

This change does the following:
 1. Renames ExoPlayerWrapper to ExoPlayerTestRunner as it better reflects
    its purpose.
 2. Adds an internal Builder to easily set-up the test in a coherent way. This
    allows to only set necessary test components while using defaults for the rest.
 3. Integrate ActionSchedule.
 4. Apply the new structure to the existing tests currently using ExoPlayerWrapper.

SKIPPED can't be handled as CONTENT_RESUME_REQUESTED because after skipping an
ad there may be further ads to play in its ad group.

Remove workaround for handling unexpected playAd without stopAd, as the player
can instead recover when IMA sends CONTENT_RESUME_REQUESTED. This in turn fixes
handling of the case where playAd is called twice but IMA expects only the
first ad to play, when skipping a particular ad. (Add an ad tag where this
occurs to internal samples.)

Check whether a currently playing ad has been marked as played in
ExoPlayerImplInternal, and handle this case as a seek. This ensures that any
loaded ad periods are discarded in the case of CONTENT_RESUME_REQUESTED.

We clear all the sample data from the queue in this case, but
not the upstream format. Since we have an optimization that
allows the upstream format to be read in advance of another
sample being written into the queue, this can result in an
unsupported format being read by a consuming renderer. This
change ensures the upstream format is correctly cleared in the
problematic case.

We currently read at most 5 packets at a time from the

how efficiently the underlying DataSource handles lots
of small reads. It seems likely, however, that DataSource
implementations will in general more efficiently handle
fewer larger reads, and in the case of this extractor
it's trivial to do this.

Notes:
- The change appears to make little difference in my
  testing with DefaultHttpDataSource, although analysis
  in #3040 suggests that it does help.
- This change shouldn't have any negative implications
  (i.e. at worst it should be neutral wrt performance). In
  particular it should not make buffering any more likely,
  because the underlying DataSource should return fewer
  bytes than are being requested in the case that it
  cannot fully satisfy the requested amount.

If seek is called for a non-seekable period, when the period is prepared the

start position is part of the renderer offset for the first loaded period
holder, after the update the renderer offset start position and the new start

negative.

The first period holder's renderer offset is the fixed base offset (60 seconds)
plus its start position, but the start position is always subtracted. Avoid
subtracting the start position for the first period holder so that when it

ParsableBitArray is quite expensive. In particular readBits

separate change will follow that optimizes readBit, but for
this particular case there's no real value to using a
ParsableBitArray anyway; use of ParsableBitArray IMO only
really becomes useful when you need to parse a bitstream more
than 4 bytes long, or where parsing the bitstream requires
some control flow (if/for) to parse.

There are probably other places where we're using

Really low hanging fruit optimization for TS extraction.

ParsableBitArray is quite expensive. In particular readBits
contains at least 2 if blocks and a for loop, and was being
called 5 times per 188 byte packet (4 times via readBit). A
separate change will follow that optimizes readBit, but for
this particular case there's no real value to using a
ParsableBitArray anyway; use of ParsableBitArray IMO only
really becomes useful when you need to parse a bitstream more
than 4 bytes long, or where parsing the bitstream requires
some control flow (if/for) to parse.

There are probably other places where we're using
ParsableBitArray over-zealously. I'll roll that into a
tracking bug for looking in more detail at all extractors.

These changes are in part related to handling playback of mixed clear
and encrypted content, where we might want to use a secure decoder
throughout, but only have drm init data and only care about the state
of the DrmSession during playback of encrypted parts.

- requiresSecureDecoderComponent became unnecessary when we added
  ExoMediaCrypto, which provides a layer in which requiresSecureDecoderComponent
  can be overridden.
- Relaxed requirements for obtaining the MediaCrypto. It's helpful
  to allow retrieval in the error state, since it can be used to
  instantiate a decoder and play clear samples.
- Deferred throwing of errors in renderer implementations. As long as
  we can get a MediaCrypto, we should init the codec. We can also
  play clear samples without failing if playClearSamplesWithoutKeys is
  true, regardless of the errors state.

This change allows you to enable/disable tracks within which
all samples are key-frames without any re-buffering (e.g. audio,
text and metadata). This effectively reverts V2 back to the
behavior in V1, only this time we're doing it properly. []ly
disabling/enabling, or disabling/enabling whilst paused, no longer
cause samples to get ""lost"" between the source and renderers.

Note it also becomes really easy to support a few other things,
although support is not exposed in this change:

- Enable/disable video tracks without any re-buffering, by
  changing the toKeyframe argument passed to discardTo to true.
- Retain media in the buffer for some time after it's been played
  (e.g. to support a single back-5s-seek efficiently), by
  subtracting the desired back-buffer time from the value that's
  passed to discardTo.

It's a bit messy at the moment with the deprecated methods
in there, but on the read side the new set of methods is as
follows:

Modifies the start of buffer:
- discardTo(time, keyframe, ...) [this is new]
- discardToRead()
- discardToEnd()

Modifies the read position:
- rewind()
- advanceTo(time, keyframe, ...) [this is a generalization of skipToKeyframeBefore]
- advanceToEnd() [previously called skipAll]
- read(...)

Which seems quite nice and self-consistent, and is powerful
enough for everything that we need to do as we move MediaSource
implementations over to the new methods.

TODOs for subsequent changes:
- Re-order methods in the two classes so that they're actually in
  the same order, and move the deprecated ones out of the way
- Enhance SampleQueueTest to also cover new functionality, as we
  start transitioning MediaSource implementations over to use it.

Cuurently, ClippingMediaSource issues an initial discontinuity. This causes the

This change disables the use of an initial discontinuity for audio-only media under

Previously, writeAllocationNode was not advanced to the

This wasn't actually broken, but is confusing because it

temporarily refer the node after the current write node.

Currently, media is discarded from DefaultTrackOutput
and SampleMetadataQueue as soon as it's been read. In
upcoming changes we'll decouple discard and read. This
will make it possible to retain already-read media in
these buffer classes, and allow the read position to
be moved backward as far as media is retained. This is
important for fixing an edge case around 608/EMSG
tracks, and could also underpin future features like
allowing retaining of X-seconds past media in the
buffer.

This change renames some variables and methods to
prepare for the upcoming changes. read/write indices
are renamed to start/end. The upcoming changes will
add a read index that's between the two. isEmpty is
inverted and renamed to hasNextSample, since it will
be possible to not have a next sample (because the
read index == end index) but for the buffer to not
be empty (because start index < read index).

A DummySurface is useful with MediaCodec on API levels 23+.
Rather than having to release a MediaCodec instance when the
app no longer has a real surface to output to, it's possible
to retain the MediaCodec, using MediaCodec.setOutputSurface
to target a DummySurface instance instead. When the app has
a real surface to output to again, it can call swap this
surface back in instantaneously. Without DummySurface a new
MediaCodec has to be instantiated at this point, and decoding
can only start from a key-frame in the media.

A future change may hook this up internally in MediaCodecRenderer
for supported use cases, although this looks a little awkward. If
this approach isn't viable, we can require applications wanting
this to set a DummySurface themselves. This isn't easy to do with
the way SimpleExoPlayerView.setPlayer works at the moment, however,
so some changes will be needed either way.

A DummySurface is useful with MediaCodec on API levels 23+.
Rather than having to release a MediaCodec instance when the
app no longer has a real surface to output to, it's possible
to retain the MediaCodec, using MediaCodec.setOutputSurface
to target a DummySurface instance instead. When the app has
a real surface to output to again, it can call swap this
surface back in instantaneously. Without DummySurface a new
MediaCodec has to be instantiated at this point, and decoding
can only start from a key-frame in the media.

A future change may hook this up internally in MediaCodecRenderer
for supported use cases, although this looks a little awkward. If
this approach isn't viable, we can require applications wanting
this to set a DummySurface themselves. This isn't easy to do with
the way SimpleExoPlayerView.setPlayer works at the moment, however,
so some changes will be needed either way.

The API is the same for all cases and the CronetEngine.Builder automatically
selects the newest option or falls back to default http.

To avoid that apps using this extension need to add a dependency to Cronet
themselves, I added a CronetEngineFactory to the Exoplayer extension.

Fixes the following issues:

1. When a surface is set, it's expected that the renderer will
notify video size + when a frame is rendered to it. This is true
even if the surface isn't changing. Right now this is achieved
by setting renderedFirstFrame to false, but this is problematic
in the case that the surface isn't changing because (a) it will
force rendering of a subsequent frame to the output even when
paused, which is incorrect, and (b) isReady will return false
until this occurs.

2. When the surface really is changing, isReady can return false
until the first frame has been rendered into the new surface, which
will break seamless surface switching. This change allows isReady
to return true up to allowedJoiningTimeMs for this case.

Prior to this change, the only way to switch SimpleExoPlayerView
was to do:

oldView.setPlayer(null);
newView.setPlayer(player);

This would cause the video renderer to have to transition through
oldSurface->noSurface->newSurface, which is inefficient (noSurface
requires platform decoders to be fully released).

After this change we support:

newView.setPlayer(player);
oldView.setPlayer(null);

This results in direct oldSurface->newSurface transitions, which are
seamless on Android M and above. The change also adds some robustness
against developers ending up with strange behavior as a result of
clearing the player from a view in a different ordering than we expect
w.r.t. registering of other listeners.

Before modularisation of the code, it was possible to do an out of tree build

broken as using -PbuildDir=someDir will force the same directory for each
projects, which breaks the gradle build system.

This commit adds a new externalBuildDir project property to allow out of tree
builds again. When set, it updates the buildDir property for each project to
point to ${externalBuildDir}/${project.name}. That way, the build artifacts are
written in the out of tree directory in a project specific folder.

To do an out of tree build, use

    gradle -PexternalBuildDir=someDir ...

If AudioTrack.setPlaybackParameters was called before initialization (for
example, when an audio renderer is enabled) the parameters would actually be
dropped, because configure calls reset, which didn't apply draining playback
parameters if the track was not initialized. It would then overwrite the
draining parameters with the current parameters.

Set the playback parameters directly (without draining) for uninitialized tracks
so that the call to setPlaybackParameters in configure is a no-op.

Also, reset the stored channel count and sample rate when the audio processor
is released so that configure returns true when it is next used, which makes
sure that it gets flushed.

The player's current period index was not masked while there were
unacknowledged seeks. This led to the displayed position jumping, between when
seekTo was called (after which the position would be masked but not the period
index) and the seek being acknowledged (at which point the time bar's position
would jump back to the seek position, due to the period index being resolved).
Mask the period index, like the window index, to fix this behavior.

This change also ensures that format changes are read whilst the
renderer is enabled but without a codec. This is necessary to
ensure the drm session is updated (or replaced).

Updating the format is also needed so that the up-to-date format is
used in the case that the codec is initialized later due to the
surface being set. Previously, if an ABR change occurred between
the format being read and the surface being attached, we would
instantiate the codec and then immediately have to reconfigure it
when as a result of reading the up-to-date format. For a non-adaptive
codec this resulted in the codec being immediately released and
instantiated again!

Add methods to ExoPlayer for setting/getting the playback speed, using
SonicAudioProcessor.

Remove PlaybackParams support, as the AudioTrack timestamp does not work
reliably on Marshmallow. The platform also uses Sonic and performance
should be comparable between the Java and native versions on recent Android
runtimes.

In a later change, SonicAudioProcessor will be made public so it can
be used in conjunction with other processors.

The way it was before worked, but it's not really documented
that DrmSession methods implemented by DefaultDrmSessionManager
can be called after the session has been released, and it feels
wrong to do this.

At some point we should probably consider moving the DrmSession
part of DefaultDrmSessionManager into an inner class, to force
usage in the ""normal"" way.

Caption characters weren't being assigned to the correct window and the lack of
pen location support was causing multiple lines (and words) to be concatenated.

As per the CEA-708-B specification, section 8.10.5, when we encounter a DefineWindow
command, we're also supposed to update the current window to the newly defined one.
We were not doing this previously, resulting in text that should have been in separate
windows being combined into one. Furthermore, some content uses the SetPenLocation
command to move the cursor down a line instead of appending a new line. As we don't
currently support SetPenLocation, this resulted in multiple lines (and words) being
concatenated together, potentially causing the text to extend past the edge of the
window/screen. This change implements a workaround (until SetPenLocation is properly
supported) for this issue in which setting the pen location to a new row will append
a new-line to that window.

cues should be updated immediately, the cues can also be updated after a

Note: discardBuffer is named as it is because it'll also be
used to discard for enabled tracks soon, as a result of the
remaining TODO in ChunkSampleStream. For enabled tracks the
discard will also be conditional on the samples having been
consumed, obviously.

Move initialization code from the audio renderers into handleBuffer. The audio
session id and tunneling enabled state can be altered using new setters.

This change is not intended to change the behavior of the audio renderers.
Before this change, the AudioTrack would always be reinitialized by the
renderers before calling handleBuffer.

Add a protected onAudioTrackUnderrun method for custom renderers that want to
implement custom handling of underruns.

Cue has been modified to optionally accept a fill color and a toggle specifying when to use the fill color. When the fill color toggle is set, then SubtitlePainter will use the fill color value instead of the color specified by the device's Accessibility settings. Cea708Decoder has also been modified to propagate that value, as well as cleaned up (in terms of documentation) to prepare it for inclusion in the open-source project.

There is also a new Cea708Cue, extending Cue, which holds the Cue's priority, which is used to sort potentially overlapping cues/windows.

Note that I've left the @ClosedSource annotation and logging in this CL. I intend to start testing the 608 and 708 functionality in the Fiber app to ensure that it works as expected on a wide-range of channels (as opposed to the single channel in ExoPlayer Demo) before removing these.

- If the current period being played is removed and a new period
  to play cannot be resolved, assume we've gone off the end of
  the playlist and transition to the ended state. This allows
  the current source to be re-used (unlike the previous behavior
  of considering it an error). Treat valid seeks that cannot be
  resolved due to concurrent timeline update similarly.
- Add seek sanity check back to ExoPlayerImpl. Meh. It's probably
  best to keep this, since it stops the exposed window index
  being invalid w.r.t the exposed timeline.

embedded in MP4 broke when we started passing the extra
byte for the TS case (and adjusted the decoder to assume
the byte was present).

This change introduces a special mimeType for the case
where the byte is implicit (!). An alternative option
was to insert the extra byte every 2 bytes in the MP4
extractor, but this is really quite fiddly to get right.

Also made the loops in the 608/708 decoders robust against

case outputStreamEnded will be true and the next drainOutputBuffer

using the externally visible timeline, then adjust the

In order to expose the live window, it is necessary (unlike before) to refresh
the live playlists being played periodically so as to know where the user can
seek to. For this, the HlsPlaylistTracker is added, which is basically a map
from HlsUrl's to playlist. One of the playlists involved in the playback will
be chosen to define the live window. The playlist tracker it periodically.
The rest of the playilst will be loaded lazily. N.B: This means that for VOD,
playlists are not refreshed at all. There are three important features missing
in this CL(that will be added in later CLs):

* Blacklisting HlsUrls that point to resources that return 4xx response codes.
    As per [Internal: b/18948961].
* Allow loaded chunks to feed timestamps back to the tracker, to fix any
    drifting in live playlists.
* Dinamically choose the HlsUrl that points to the playlist that defines the
    live window.

Other features:
--------------

The tracker can also be used for keeping track of discontinuities. In the case
of single variant playlists, this is particularly useful. Might also work if
there is a that the live playlists are aligned (but this is more like working
around the issue, than actually solving it). For this, see [Internal: b/32166568]
and [Internal: b/28985320].

Add REQUIRE_HTTPS flag

to inject custom implementations of DataSource (there's no
requirement they even extend HttpDataSource for network
requesting implementations). It's possible for applications

- Make sure no events are posted on PlaybackControlView
  if it's not attached to a window. This can cause leaks.
  The target hide time is recorded if necessary and
  processed when the view is re-attached.
- Deduplicated PlaybackControlView.VisibilityListener
  invocations.
- Fixed timeouts to be more intuitive (I think).
- Fixed initial visibility of PlaybackControlView when
  used as part of SimpleExoPlayerView.
- Made some more attributes configurable from layout xml.

onPrepared/onSourceInfoRefreshed from their loading threads. That was
problematic for ConcatenatingMediaSource and MergingMediaSource, which assume
that their callbacks are called on the same thread (iterating through timelines
from all sources and updating pendingTimelineSources respectively). This change
makes them post calls to the callbacks on the playback thread.

Generally, implementing a composite MediaSource is easier if
MediaPeriod.Callback's methods are all called on the same (playback) thread, so
this change makes that part of its contract.

Also post onContinueLoadingRequested from ExtractingLoadable because
MergingMediaPeriod.onContinueLoadingRequested reads trackGroups written on the
playback thread.

If the live window has a small duration, we currently
end up setting the default start position to be right
at the start of the window. This increases the chance
of a BehindLiveWindowException.

With this change we impose a minimum 5s gap between
the start of the window and the default start position.
If the window is *really* small (<10s) then doing this
would push the default start position too close to the
end of the window. We don't have much time to play with
in either direction in this case, so we put the default
start position in the middle of the window and hope for
the best.

Referential equality was probably the right thing to do, since using .equals
breaks track selection in the case that a source exposes two or more tracks

Fix multi-period transitions with track selection overrides

An override applies across periods provided they expose the
same track groups according to .equals, but the formats in
the override are then compared against the period's formats
according to ==. Use .equals consistently to fix.

If a renderer is reading ahead of the playing period, seeking within the
playing period would fail, because renderers would not be disabled but then try
to read from SampleStreams that have a released period.

Also, in the same circumstances, seeking within the reading period would fail,
because all renderers would be disabled, but their sample streams have already
been read. When they are reenabled they expect to see a format but don't
receive one.

In both cases, seeking can just clear the timeline. This only occurs in rare
circumstances when the player is reading ahead, so the cost of re-preparing
will not be incurred often, and allows the seeking logic to be simpler.

When seeking to the default position in a period, the containing source may

this to seek the player to the live edge.

ExoPlayerImplInternal uses the same functionality when the playback position

This means that when playback transitions to a multi-period live source from
some other source (playing a concatenation of those two sources), the player
will play the live edge rather than the beginning of the earliest period.

This change merges the duties of FormatEvaluator into
TrackSelection classes, so that both the static and
dynamic parts of track selection are implemented in a
single place.

New feature: Demo app now allows you to enable random
adaptation in the track selection dialog.

Notes:

- It should be quite easy to allow application side
track blacklisting in addition to source side, as an
extension to this. That would effectively allow
applications to do seamless/deferred track selection
by creating a TrackSelection with all tracks enabled,
and then toggling the blacklist flags to select the
ones they want to be active.

- It should be trivial to implement format blacklisting
for DASH and SS as an extension to this. Will do in a
follow up CL.

when switching variants:

* In vod, the switching playback position is obtained by adding the

* In live playback this is not possible. It is assumed that the

    the playback position is obtained by subtracting the duration

With this change, MediaCodecRenderer acquires a session
from its DrmSessionManager whenever the DrmInitData in
the format changes. The DrmSessionManager is permitted
to return the same session if it can be re-used.

This plumbing adds support for:

1. Key-rotation, in the case that a key-rotation-aware
   DrmSessionManager is used. Such an implementation will
   return the same DrmSession for every aquisition, but
   will be making use of multiple MediaDrm instances within
   that session to enable the rotation.

2. Playlists with mixed clear and protected content. One
   final piece to this will be to have each MediaPeriod
   provide its own license URL. We could also allow each
   MediaPeriod to specify the DRM UUID, but switching from
   PlayReady to Widevine in a playlist seems like quite a
   hypothetical thing.

This change restores ExoPlayer to its previous behaviour.
I think we'll want a ""resetPosition"" boolean parameter on
setMediaSource at some point, but no need to add it right
now. Note that this would not always reset to the start
of the source. For a live playback it will reset to the
desired position (normally somewhere slightly behind the
live edge).

In V1 we received complaints that Renderer was too locked down.
In particular, it wasn't possible to implement a Renderer that
wrapped another Renderer, since most of the methods were package
private and final (e.g. enable).

This change defines Renderer as a proper interface, removing
this limitation. A method-reordering-only change will follow
this one, to get things into a nice consistent/sane order in

1. Rename ""extensions"" package to ""decoder"". It's used by both
   text and (should be used by) metadata, so it's no longer just
   for extensions.
2. Move Buffer objects move into the decoder package.
3. Rename SubtitleParser and MetadataParser to SubtitleDecoder
   and MetadataDecoder respectively, since they extend Decoder.
   Ditto for all subclasses.
4. Subtitle and Metadata decoders now throw their own exception
   types rather than ParserException.
5. Move MediaCodec classes into a mediacodec package, with the
   exception of the concrete audio and video renderers.
6. Create an audio package to hold the two audio renderer classes
   plus related util classes.
7. Create a video package to hold the one video renderer class
   plus related util classes.

After this change the following nice properties hold:

1. Want a video renderer? Look in the video package. Ditto for
   audio, text and metadata.
2. All TrackRenderer implementations use a decoder of some kind
   to decode buffers received from the source, so we have
   consistent terminology there.

SequenceableLoaders, which allows them to be kept in sync

Note that this change resolves the TODOs at the top of the

  should eventually go away once HLS no longer needs it.

Reading the format and/or a sample needs to be done as a
single operation. Else you can have a situation where the
queue is initially empty, and this happens:

1) Read downstream format X
2) Read downstream format X (unchanged)
3) Write format Y
4) Write first sample
5) Read first sample

The first sample then appears to be format X rather than Y.

Note that readData in the SampleSource implementations always
looks roughly the same. readReset is identical in all cases.
isReady is identical in all cases now I've fixed them to be
that way. So it should be pretty easy to get DefaultTrackOutput
to implement TrackStream directly, at which point a whole load

This is the first step toward merging of RollingSampleBuffer
and DefaultTrackOutput, which is a precursor to removing some
indirection for DASH/SS playbacks, and to moving HLS playbacks
to use a single output buffer per track (with inline splicing).

Where this is heading is that sample format changes will
eventually be attached to samples in the rolling buffer. This
will eliminate the need for piping sample formats around the
edges of the rolling buffer (e.g. via redirection in
ChunkExtractorWrapper and BaseMediaChunk.getSampleFormat).

HLS implementation, where the chunk source has a single
opportunity to cancel (and hence later replace) the chunk

ability to replace the first media chunk in the queue in

1. SampleSource now has an explicit track selection state. This state is entered
   after the source is prepared, and also by calling startTrackSelection.
2. endTrackSelection commits selection changes, and is responsible for doing the
   right thing w.r.t starting/stopping/restarting load operations.
3. All sources now start or restart a load in the case of a new track selection.
   This fixes a problem where a source could be advanced by repeatedly disabling
   and re-enabling whilst paused. Some sources didn't restart a load in this case,
   since the position was unchanged, however the downstream renderer would then
   consume media up to the first keyframe in order to render something. Hence
   each disable/re-enable would advance by a keyframe.
4. This change will enable a subsequent change where we'll discard media for
   non-selected tracks earlier than we do currently (i.e. we'll hook the extractor
   to a dummy track output, so the samples will never be written to a rolling
   buffer). This will enable a further subsequent change where buffer contributions
   are per-renderer rather than per-source.

When reading unknown duration files with CBR seeking, the Mp3Extractor could
try to read sample data from 0. This happened because synchronization did not
skip over the ID3 data when it immediately found valid frames. When the invalid
sample data is read, the extractor tries to resynchronize from the next byte

longer than the synchronization search distance.

ojw28,2016-03-14 11:36:56,https://api.github.com/repos/google/ExoPlayer/git/commits/d3d63101d1b4266ae41c7341add5df33b23eec81,d3d63101d1b4266ae41c7341add5df33b23eec81,"[Refactor - Step #5] Introduce TrackSelector

Notes:

- The way this works is that every time the player needs to
  select some tracks it invokes the TrackSelector. When a
  track selection is actually activated (i.e. ""hits the
  screen"") it gets passed back to the TrackSelector, which
  allows it to expose the current tracks through an API that
  it may choose to define. Since playlist support doesn't exist
  yet, it's currently the case that the pass-back always occurs
  immediately.
- A TrackSelector can invalidate its previous selections if its
  selection criteria changes. This will force the player to invoke
  it again to make a new selection. If the new selection is the
  same as the previous one for a renderer then the player handles
  this efficiently (i.e. turns it into a no-op).
- DefaultTrackSelector supports disabling/enabling of renderers.
  Separately, it supports overrides to select specific formats.
  Since formats may change (playlists/periods), overrides are
  specific to not only the renderer but also the set of formats
  that are available to it. If the formats available to a renderer
  change then the override will no longer apply. If the same set
  of formats become available at some point later, it will apply
  once more. This will nicely handle cases like ad-insertion where
  the ads have different formats, but all segments of main content
  use the same set of formats.
- In general, in  multi-period or playlist cases, the preferred
  way of selecting formats will be via constraints (e.g. ""don't play
  HD"", ""prefer higher quality audio"") rather than explicit format
  selections. The ability to set various constraints on
  DefaultTrackSelector is future work.

Note about the demo app:

- I've removed the verbose log toggle. I doubt anyone has
  ever used it! I've also removed the background audio option.
  Without using a service it can't be considered a reference
  implementation, so it's probably best to leave developers to
  figure this one out. Finally, listening to AudioCapabilities
  has also gone. This will be replaced by having the player
  detect and handle the capabilities change internally in a
  future CL. This will work by allowing a renderer to invalidate
  the track selections when its capabilities change, much like
  how a selector is able to invalidate the track selections in
  this CL.
- It's now possible to enable ABR with an arbitrary subset of
  tracks.
- Unsupported tracks are shown grayed out in the UI. I'm not
  showing tracks that aren't associated to any renderer, but we
  could optionally add that later.
- Every time the tracks change, there's logcat output showing
  all of the tracks and which ones are enabled. Unassociated
  tracks are displayed in this output.

- Format can represent both container and sample formats.
  If a container contains a single track (as is true in
  DASH and SmoothStreaming) then the container Format can
  also contain sufficient information about the samples
  to allow for track selection. This avoids the Format to
  MediaFormat conversions that we were previously doing in
  ChunkSource implementations.

- One important result of this change is that adaptive
  format evaluation and static format selection now use the
  same format objects, which is a whole lot less confusing
  for someone who wants to implement both initial selection
  and subsequent adaptation logic. It's not in the V2 doc,
  but it may well make sense if the TrackSelector not only
  selects the tracks to enable for an adaptive playback, but
  also injects a FormatEvaluator when enabling them that will
  control the subsequent adaptive selections. That would make
  it so that all format selection logic originates from the
  same place.

- As part of this change, the adaptiveX variables are removed
  from the format object; they don't really correspond to a
  single format. This also saves on having to inject the max
  video dimensions through a bunch of classes.

Duration was originally included in MediaFormat to match the
framework class, but it actually doesn't make much sense. In
many containers there's no such thing as per-stream duration,
and in any case we don't really care. Setting the duration on
each format required excessive piping.

This change moves duration into SeekMap instead, which seems
to make a lot more sense because it's at the container level,
and because being able to seek is generally couplied with
knowing how long the stream is.

This change is also a step toward merging Format and MediaFormat
into a single class (because Format doesn't have a duration),
which is coming soon.

[Step 4 - Partial, of []

- The capabilities checks previously performed in VideoFormatSelectorUtil
  are now performed in MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer. This means they'll be
  useful for non-chunk use cases (e.g. when using ExtractorSampleSource).
- Added capabilities checks for audio in MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer. We
  didn't check audio capabilities previously.
- Added functionality to allow a TrackRenderer to indicate the extent of
  its adaptive support.

The idea here is that a TrackSelector (to be introduced) will have access to:

(a) TrackGroups from the SampleSource that indicate whether they support
adaptive playbacks and the formats of each individual track.
(b) TrackRenderers that indicate whether they support adaptive playbacks as
well as how capable they are of rendering formats of individual tracks.

This is everything that a TrackSelector needs from the player components in
order to decide how to wire things up. Note that a TrackSelector may opt to
treat FORMAT_EXCEEDS_CAPABILITIES as FORMAT_HANDLED at its own risk, if it
thinks that it (or the user) knows better. This is a request that we've seen
from third parties for better handling cases where capabilities aren't
accurately reported by the underlying platform.

When a seek is performed, renderers currently perform the
actions that they need to take in two places: Some changes
are performed in seekTo implementations. Other changes are
performed when discontinuities are read from the source.

In HLS we need to perform what is effectively a seek
originating in the source. To support this, this CL allows
discontinuities read from the source to modify the playback
position. All actions that renderers perform as a result
of a seek are moved to be performed when a discontinuity is
received.

Best way to understand CL:
- Look at SampleSource interface change and then at the
  concrete implementations, to make sure they've been
  changed properly.
- Look at SampleSourceTrackRenderer change.
- Look at concrete renderers. The general pattern is that
  code previously performed in seekTo and READ_DISCONTINUITY
  is merged into onDiscontinuity().

Note: This will be further untangled in V2.

This allows the same adjusters to be used by multiple
HlsChunkSource instances. This is necessary because
WebVTT chunks will be loaded by a second chunk source
to the one loading audio/video. In both cases the same
timestamp adjustments will need to be applied.

Each source may transition from one discontinuity sequence
to the next at a slightly different time, so it's necessary
to maintain a separate adjuster for each sequence.

An adjuster can only be initialized correctly using audio/video
and not WebVTT, because the start time in a WebVTT file in
HLS doesn't necessarily correspond to the chunk start time,
which means the timestamp offset calculated by the adjuster
could end up being incorrect. Hence sources providing WebVTT
chunks will set isMasterSource to false. Lovely, right :(?

Moved the behaviors related to Cue's to the WebvttCueParser class.
This way, the parsing methods will be more easily accessible to
other classes, such as the MP4Webvtt parser. This class also has
some methods that require state to avoid repetitive avoidable
allocations. The method visibility is subject to changes in
further CLs.

Targeting to all API level 19 devices using the OMX.SEC.avc.dec

negative implications if we apply the workaround on devices that
don't really need it, except to slow down seeking slightly due

We normally expect each frame to come in its own PES packet,

uses the frame rate in the stream to increment the frame

a single PES.

Note that since we don't expect 100s of frames in a single

that may accumulate due to use of a frame duration should be
fine.

one decoration (span).
That's because SpannableStringBuilder.setSpan(span, start, end, flag)
found an earlier set span (the static allocated span's reference
is the same each time) and only refreshed this first span's start and

this makes the newly allocated span objects distinguishable.

Currently, input/output buffers can 'leak' if they are dequeued then the decoder
is flush()ed. This happens if an input buffer is dequeued then a discontinuity
is read, or an output buffer is dequeued and is early. If this happens several
times, no more buffers are available.

This change makes flush() work like MediaCodec: it returns all dequeued
input/output buffers to the codec. Keeping the behavior in line with MediaCodec
might make it easier to factor out a common decoder interface in the future.

The sample data position is the sum of the data offset and the base data offset.
The base data offset is either specified in the stream, or defaults to the first
byte position in the moof box. (We only support one traf per moof currently, so
the offset does not need to be assigned for later track fragments.) The data
position can optionally be offset by a data position read from the trun.

The auxiliary information offset is calculated in the same way, but using an
offset read from the saio box.

This change keeps the proportion offset * 256 as a floating point value rather
than rounding it before linear interpolation, which will increase precision
slightly when seeking in streams with XING headers.

In practice, this won't make much of a difference because precise seeking in VBR
MP3s with XING headers seems not to be possible without reading the entire file,
due to the fact that the (uneven) distribution of bits is represented by a fixed
number of table of contents entries."

When switching format in HLS, we instantiate a new extractor, which
adjusts TS presentation timestamps so that they align properly with
the start of the first segment in the new format. Some HLS streams
appear to have slightly misalignment that causes a glitch when using
this approach.

It's better to re-use the same timestamp adjustment across formats,
and only reset it when seeking or when there's an actual discontinuity.
This is because the HLS spec guarantees PTS timestamp alignment across
different formats.

We'll also need something like PtsTimestampAdjuster to share between
separated audio and WebVTT tracks, which also contain PTS timestamps
that are aligned, and will need to share a common adjustment.

- It's not possible to determine a period's duration just from the
corresponding Period element in a DASH manifest. It's necessary
to look at the start time of the next period (or the duration of the
manifest for the last period) to determine how long a period is. We
don't currently do this in the parser, and hence set duration incorrectly.
We also set period start times incorrectly because we don't set it to
equal to sum of the durations of prior periods in the case where it's
not explicitly defined.

- We're currently propagating these (incorrect) values all over the place
through data-structures that we build when parsing the Period element.

- This CL removes this redundancy, storing only the start time of each
period in Period elements, and not propagating it elsewhere. It's then
used when required in DashChunkSource."

Before preparation, and when seeking, Mp3Extractor did not handle retrying:
- synchronizedHeader was set before the header was known to be valid, which
  means that after seeing one valid frame header and then failing to read, the
  synchronization would be treated as complete.
- The input buffer would keep data loaded during synchronization but on the next
  call to synchronize when retrying it was not returned to the mark position to
  re-parse the data.

When a XING header is present but not usable (due to missing fields), CBR
seeking can be used instead. It relies on the bitrate. The bitrate from the
unusable XING header is not correct, which leads to incorrect seeking.

Also fix VBRI seeking by setting the correct offset on the frame to parse. Few

When a passthrough AudioTrack is replaced (due to seeking) the new one behaves
as if it is still emptying data from the old one, with its playback position
advancing until it runs out of data.

Data written while the 'old' AudioTrack was emptying would be discarded, so
avoid writing to the new AudioTrack while the old one is still emptying.

Also avoid using AudioTrack.getTimestamp with passthrough tracks, as this causes
the playback position to jump to a position that breaks audio/video
synchronization."

- It's probably easiest to think of this as a standalone HLS change, which is splitting out the ""loading"" and ""consuming"" sides of HlsExtractor and a good structural change in its own right. To do this, HlsExtractorWrapper becomes a final class implementing the consuming side. HlsExtractor becomes an interface defining the loading side.

- The bigger picture is that, hopefully, HlsExtractor will become a lightweight extractor interface that can be used throughout the library. Because it doesn't need to implement the consuming side, we'll save on having to re-implement the consuming side for every extractor (we'll probably need one consuming side implementation for HLS/DASH/SmoothStreaming, and a second one for everything else, both of which will use SampleQueue). It's expected that the HlsExtractor interface will need to change to accommodate all use cases.

- The next step in unification will be to try and have FragmentedMp4Extractor implement HlsExtractor (which will need renaming). Once this is done, I'll try and move the chunk package over to use the HlsExtractor interface."

Added an expiration time field to playlists blacklisted to allow
Exoplayer to continue playback when playlists that failed were
recovered from a bad state.

In live environments, some times occur that primary encoder stop
working for a while. In that cases, HLS failover mechanism in the
player should detect the situation and “switch” to playlists served by
the backup encoder (in case a backup encoder exists). This was well
managed before these changes.

However, and to ensure a playback experience that can recover itself
from temporary issues, we cannot blacklist a playlist forever. When
streaming live events using HLS, it is quite typical that the player
needs to switch from primary to backup playlists, and from backup to
primary ones, from time to time to have playback working when temporary
issues in the network/encoder are happening. Most of the issues are
recoverable, so what I have implemented is a mechanism that makes
blacklisted playlist to be available again after a while (60 seconds).

Evaluation of this algorithm should happen just when something fails.
If player is working with a backup playlist, it shouldn’t switch to the
primary one at least something fail."

Some extractor implementations underneath MediaExtractor require a seekTo
call after tracks are selected to ensure samples are read from the correct
position. De-duplicating logic was preventing this from happening in some
cases, causing issues like:

https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/301

Note that seeking all tracks a side effect of track selection sucks if
you already have one or more tracks selected, because it introduces
discontinuities to the already selected tracks. However, in general, it
*is* necessary to specify the position for the track being selected,
because the underlying extractor doesn't have enough information to know
where to start reading from. It can't determine this based on the read
positions of the already selected tracks, because the samples in these
tracks might be very sparse with respect to time.

I think a more optimal fix would be to change the SampleExtractor
interface to receive the current position as an argument to selectTrack.
For our own extractors, we'd seek the newly selected track to that
position, whilst the already enabled tracks would be left in their
current positions (if possible). For FrameworkSampleExtractor we'd
still have no choice but to call seekTo on the extractor to seek all
of the tracks. This solution ends up being more complex though, because:

- The SampleExtractor then needs a way of telling DefaultSampleSource
  which tracks were actually seeked, so that the pendingDiscontinuities
  flags can be set correctly.
- It's a weird API that requires the ""current playback position to seek
  only the track being enabled""

So it may not be worth it! I think this fix is definitely good for now,
in any case.

Use of Sample objects was inefficient for several reasons:

- Lots of objects (1 per sample, obviously).
- When switching up bitrates, there was a tendency for all Sample
  instances to need to expand, which effectively led to our whole
  media buffer being GC'd as each Sample discarded its byte[] to
  obtain a larger one.
- When a keyframe was encountered, the Sample would typically need
  to expand to accommodate it. Over time, this would lead to a
  gradual increase in the population of Samples that were sized to
  accommodate keyframes. These Sample instances were then typically
  underutilized whenever recycled to hold a non-keyframe, leading
  to inefficient memory usage.

This CL introduces RollingBuffer, which tightly packs pending sample
data into a byte[]s obtained from an underlying BufferPool. Which
fixes all of the above. There is still an issue where the total
memory allocation may grow when switching up bitrate, but we can
easily fix that from this point, if we choose to restrict the buffer
based on allocation size rather than time.

The complexity around not enabling the video renderer before it
has a valid surface is because MediaCodecTrackRenderer supports
a ""discard"" mode where it pulls through and discards samples
without a decoder. This mode means that if the demo app were to
enable the renderer before supplying the surface, the renderer
could discard the first few frames prior to getting the surface,
meaning video rendering wouldn't happen until the following sync
frame.

To get a handle on complexity, I think we're better off just removing
support for this mode, which nicely decouples how the demo app
handles surfaces v.s. how it handles enabling/disabling renderers."

This is the start of a sequence of changes to fix the ref'd
github issue. Currently TsExtractor involves multiple memory
copy steps:

DataSource->Ts_BitArray->Pes_BitArray->Sample->SampleHolder

This is inefficient, but more importantly, the copy into
Sample is problematic, because Samples are of dynamically
varying size. The way we end up expanding Sample objects to
be large enough to hold the data being written means that we
end up gradually expanding all Sample objects in the pool
(which wastes memory), and that we generate a lot of GC churn,
particularly when switching to a higher quality which can
trigger all Sample objects to expand.

The fix will be to reduce the copy steps to:

DataSource->TsPacket->SampleHolder

We will track Pes and Sample data with lists of pointers into
TsPackets, rather than actually copying the data. We will
recycle these pointers.

The following steps are approximately how the refactor will
progress:

1. Start reducing use of BitArray. It's going to be way too
complicated to track bit-granularity offsets into multiple packets,
and allow reading across packet boundaries. In practice reads
from Ts packets are all byte aligned except for small sections,
so we'll move over to using ParsableByteArray instead, so we
only need to track byte offsets.

2. Move TsExtractor to use ParsableByteArray except for small
sections where we really need bit-granularity offsets.

3. Do the actual optimization.

better to do a simple linear search in a List<Long>. That way
we can avoid boxing every incoming time stamp value. In the general
case this will be linear searching in an empty list, a very fast

- The HlsSampleSource now owns the extractor. TsChunk is more or less dumb.
  The previous model was weird, because you'd end up ""reading"" samples from
  TsChunk objects that were actually parsed from the previous chunk (due to
  the way the extractor was shared and maintained internal queues).
- Split out consuming and reading in the extractor.
- Make it so we consume 5s ahead. This is a window we allow for uneven
  interleaving, whilst preventing huge read-ahead (e.g. in the case of sparse
  ID3 samples).
- Avoid flushing the extractor for a discontinuity until it has been fully
  drained of previously parsed samples. This avoids skipping media shortly
  before discontinuities.
- Also made start-up faster by avoiding double-loading the first segment.

Why: This was a bad initial choice. Manifests typically define bandwidth in
bits/sec. If you divide by 8 then you're throwing away information due to
rounding. Unfortunately it turns out that SegmentTemplate based manifests
require you to be able to recall the bitrate exactly (because it's substituted
in during segment URL construction).

Medium term: We should consider converting all our bandwidth estimation
over to bits/sec as well.

Note1: Also changed Period id to be a string, to match the mpd spec.
Note2: Made small optimization in FormatEvaluator to not consider discarding
the first chunk (durationBeforeThisSegmentUs will always be negative, and even
in the error case where it's not, removing the first thunk should be an error)."

1. Fix SimpleCache startReadWrite asymmetry. Allow more concurrency.

- startReadWrite does not have the concept of a read lock. Once
  a cached span is returned, the caller can do whatever it likes
  for as long as it wants to. This allows a read to be performed
  in parallel with a write that starts after it.
- If there's an ongoing write, startReadWrite will block even if
  the return operation will be a read. So there's a weird asymmetry
  where reads can happen in parallel with writes, but only if the
  reads were started first.
- This CL removes the asymmetry, by allowing a read to start even
  if the write lock is held.
- Note that the reader needs to be prepared for the thing it's
  reading to disappear, but this was already the case, and will
  always be the case since the reader will need to handle disk
