Some things to note here:
1.: There are bugs in the code as I'm no expert on zsh completion *at all*. I just trial-and-error'd a big part of it.
2.: Some things are not done here (marked with a `TODO`), namely the statement syntax of some `nft add` commands.
3.: Some completions try to complete existing chain names/rule handles/table names. For this you either have to be root or use sudo AND enable the gain-privileges zstyle (otherwise this will not work)
4.: I also found the nft man page to be somewhat lacking so there might be some edge case completions which are plain wrong."

With OpenSSL 1.1.0e (likely earlier as well) the `list-*` commands are
no longer supported causing completion to fail for subcommands and
arguments of digest and cipher subcommands.

Instead use the output of `openssl help`, removing the section headers
and splitting the list of commands which that displays.  Earlier
versions don't actually have a `help` subcommand but they did already
produce the same help output for unknown subcommands, just preceded with
an error message about the invalid command. This error message is
removed along with the section headers.

One use of the obsolete `list-cipher-algorithms` subcommand remains, but
it is in the completion for the `genpkey` subcommand which is also
obsolete."

Support to find Ansible hosts file in DebOps style projects"
ypid,2017-02-11 11:15:22,https://api.github.com/repos/zsh-users/zsh-completions/git/commits/48d620dcb2c8937190ad213e868330ea956b272d,48d620dcb2c8937190ad213e868330ea956b272d,"Support to find Ansible hosts file in DebOps style projects

In [DebOps](https://debops.org/), it is common to have the Ansible host
inventory in a projects directory below ""$HOME"". This allows to have multiple
and separate Ansible environments.  For such a setup, the host inventory can be
found at `$PWD/ansible/inventory/hosts` as Ansible is typically executed from
the root of the project.  This patch adds support for such a layout as
fallback.

pacman's completion already supports this extension so just follow suit.

Motivation: makepkg produces packages (e.g. from AUR) without compression
with its PKGEXT='.pkg.tar' setting, which speeds up building and installing
them manually."

  * some commands received new options

Also some unrelated enhancements:

  * generic `--with-PROG`, `--PROG-options`, and `--PROG-option`
  are replaced with real options (e.g. `--with-gcc`, `--gcc-options`,
  `--gcc-option` and the like) where possible

Having a vim modeline or emacs local variable line somewhere in the
middle of the file isn't really helpful.  By default, vim will only
check the first and last 5 lines of a file for a modeline (assuming the
modeline option is enabled).  Emacs is even more strict about the type
of local variable line that was in use, it will only check the first
line of the file or the second line if the first line specifies a script
interpreter (which isn't the case here).

Move the vim modeline to the end of the file so that it can actually be
found by vim but is out of the way for editing.  For emacs more work is
required, convert that to the more verbose Local Variables syntax which
emacs will look for starting 3000 characters from the end of the file.

Also there is no zsh mode for emacs (according to
zsh-users/zsh-completions#75), use the ""Shell-Script"" mode instead.
This seems to automatically detect that the files are for zsh.

I'm not an emacs user, so I haven't tested that portion much.  But, this
does at least improve the syntax highlighting there."
