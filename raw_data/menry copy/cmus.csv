* Correct parsing for cue files with byte order mark

Cue files which have a byte order mark are improperly parsed. Currently,
if there is a byte order mark present and a valid cue token on the first
line of the file, the token is not recognized and the first line of cue
data is missed. For my use case, the first line would the the album
title, and therefore any cue files in my library would be displayed with
`<No Title>` as the album title.

This commit looks for the presence of a UTF-8 byte order mark and
advances the file buffer beyond it. In UTF-8, the byte order mark isn't
recommended and really serves no purpose other than to signify the
beginning of a UTF-8 stream."

These functions allow void functions that would usually block the UI
thread to run in a separate thread. They are accompanied by a series of
macros that easily turn any given void function (with 0 to 3 arguments)
into a function that runs in the aforementioned thread.

For example, consider the following function:

```c
void f(const char *name)
{
    printf(""Hello %s!\n"", name);
    sleep(10);
}
```

Applying the macros produces:

```c
DELEGATE_1(f, const char *, name)
{
    printf(""Hello %s!\n"", name);
    sleep(10);
}
```

A call to `f` now returns immediately and the function prints and sleeps
in the dedicated thread.

NOTE: There is only one such thread and the call above will block all
other delegated functions for 10 seconds."

ncurses already sleeps in the first getch call if it returns an ESC.
Sleeping in the second call is unnecessary because the character (if
any) is already available.

The user can set how long ncurses sleeps by setting the ESCDELAY
environment variable to the time in milliseconds. For example

$ ESCDELAY=25 cmus

will make pressing ESC in command mode leave it almost instantaneously.

Also remove an unnecessary cbreak call because cbreak and halfdelay are
mutually exclusive."

Only perform sample rate synchronization when user opt in sync_sample_rate. Other values in the format should be transparent for CoreAudio conversion. Particularly, If user have high end DACs (such as 24 bit DAC) it's always better to select higher bit depth rather than sync it with the audio file.

The channels where getting out of sync when drop was called. The
underlying problem is, that can only keep the channels in sync, when
op_jack_cb is the sole consumer of the ring buffers.

If we set a flag and clear the buffers in op_jack_cb, op_jack_drop
returns immediately and new data is written by op_jack_write while or
before (or after) the buffers where cleared. Result is the same as just
dropping the ring buffers.

Returning -OP_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED works fine, just seeking is not as
responsive (but without gaps :)"

There is a race condition in the main loop where a job finishes after
`update` is called but before `worker_has_job` is called. For example:
`:load` in the playlist view sometimes leaves the user with an empty
playlist.

This can be fixed by calling `worker_has_job` before `update` but then the
user has to wait up to 250ms for the results to show up. Instead we add a
new function `ui_curses_notify` that can be called any time and causes the
main loop to wake up. This function is called in `free_add_job`."

When playing with ffmpeg plugin and user seeks to the beginning of track, cmus
wouldn't immediately start from the beginning, but would continue playing for
a while (about 3~5 seconds), and then suddenly jump to the beginning.

A segment of code is added in ffmpeg_seek() to flush the decoded output and
reset the input buffer. This should make it jump immediately, but the current
duration after jump is still not precise."

When the enum `format_id` and the array `str_defaults` are used in the functions `options_add` and `options_load`,  both have to be in the same order for the code to work.
The code breaks silently if this is not the case.

This patch removes this dependence and moves the array (which is currently 1000 lines away) right next to the enum to make the connection between these two structures clear."

Since ffmpeg 2.0, the macro AVCODEC_MAX_AUDIO_FRAME_SIZE is deprecated
and removed. This commit simply defines the macro if it's not defined
previously, using the same value it used to be in old versions of
libavcodec.

Actually, as my branch has been using swr_convert, where caller specifies
the size of output buffer, even if the current size of 192000 proved to
be not enough in the future, we can simply let swr_convert deal with the
insufficient size by a small modification.

Currently the parameters to swr_convert() still assumes that the size of
192000 samples is always enough for the output buffer.

Currently if you play a stream using cmus, you can see the
artist/album/title information in the curses display, but the same
information is not available by querying the server with cmus-remote -Q.

I wanted to be able to get to that information, and I think my way makes
sense ... basically I've added a new field (stream) to the output of
cmus-remote -Q which contains the stream metadata.

Here's an example of how this new functionality looks:

% cmus-remote -Q
status playing
file http://stream.mybox.com
duration -1
position 2
tag title Some Cool stream
tag genre Some Cool Genre
tag comment http://some-stream-url
stream Fila Brazillia - Brazilification Remixes 95-99 (CD2) - Freakpower / New Direction (Fila Brazillia Mix) # <- NEW!
set aaa_mode album
set continue true
set play_library false
set play_sorted true
set replaygain disabled
set replaygain_limit true
set replaygain_preamp 6.000000
set repeat true
set repeat_current false
set shuffle false
set softvol false
set vol_left 16
set vol_right 16

Incidentally, this field can also be used as a boolean to let a client
know whether or not a stream is being played."

* Lack of conditionals in format string
  (e.g. we maybe only want to show the composer if one is present)
* Lack of proper handling of multiple values for a tag
  (e.g. we want to join multiple composers, like ""John Lennon / Paul
  McCartney"")
I plan to address both issues in the future, also the ability to use
them for filtering.

The added format options are:

                     ID3v2  additional freeform
    -------------------------------------------
    %{arranger}
    %{composer}      TCOM   SONGWRITER
    %{conductor}     TPE3
    %{lyricist}      TEXT   SONGWRITER
    %{performer}
    %{remixer}       TPE4
    %{label}         TPUB
    %{publisher}     TPUB
    %{work}
    %{opus}
    %{partnumber}
    %{part}
    %{subtitle}      TIT3   VERSION

Notice that ""songwriter"" maps to both composer and lyricist, and
""version"" is a synonym for ""subtitle"". Left to do is the ID3v2 mapping
for arranger and performer, which requires multi-value decoding of TMCL
and TIPL. Also ""producer"" could be added.

The rbtree of editable.c now only contains unique tracks, while the
linked list contains all, e.g. for a sorted playlist:

     ________________D__________
    /                .          \
  _B_______          .       ____F_

.  .        .        .     .     .  .
A--B--B--B--C--C--C--D--D--E--E--F--G

For the play queue:

A
.
A--A--A--A--A--A--A

For the library:

     ____D____
    /    .    \
  _B_    .    _F_
 / . \   .   / . \
A  .  C  .  E  .  G
.  .  .  .  .  .  .
A--B--C--D--E--F--G

This should reduce the segfaults due to tree/list degenerations in the
long run. It also simplifies play_queue.c a lot!"

When adding a file, check for the CUE sheet with the same name. If it exists,
add entries from it instead of the original file.

Of course, this makes the assumption that CUE sheet and track file have the

Treating CUE sheets as a playlist would have the drawback of adding both the
whole track and individual entries from it in case of recursive directory
import, which is undesireable.

Entries are added as URLs with the following syntax:

cmus decides the input plugin for local files based on their filename
extension (which is fast and usually works). Some input plugins however
can't handle all their file types, and it would be very difficult to
implement that. An example is mp4.c, which can only decode AAC, but not
ALAC (Apple Lossless) files, which have also .m4a extension. FFmpeg
contains a decoder, but mp4.c can't call ffmpeg.c.

This patch implements a fallback system:
If the input plugin fails because it doesn't support an otherwise valid
file, it can return with a new error message (IP_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE).
cmus will then try the next input plugin which supports the given
filename extension. The order is given by new ip_priorities.

The priorities also solve the problem when two input plugins have a
common subset of file extensions (e.g. mikmod<->modplug).

New file types supported:
* ALAC (Apple Lossless), .m4a
* non-PCM .wav files (a-law, μ-law, gsm, ...)"

This option lets cmus restore the last used volume. Because of the
design of pulseaudio it is not possible to change the volume before
playback (or when playback has stopped) anymore.

It is on by default, because setting volume to 100% is very annoying (if
not dangerous to ears) when flat-volumes=yes.

If it is disabled, the old behaviour (before this commit) is activated.

The shuffle list can completely be replaced by a rbtree (since the

In this case the tree contains the first of the the duplicate tracks.

""Judging by the wording of the standard (wchar.h should be included in

In the case of a ""real"" artist, chronological order makes perfect
sense.  After all, it is common to talk about ""their first album,""
""their latest album,"" etc.

In the case of compilations, however, it doesn't make sense.  If you
have a number of compilations in your library, you look for them by
name, not by the date of the first track, as a compilation may contain
tracks from many different years.  Ordering compilations by the date
of their first tracks effectively puts them into a random order, and
it also leads to series of compilations getting broken up, e.g.,

   ...
   Back To Mine compil...
   Easy Tempo Vol. 2: ...
   Easy Tempo Vol. 6: ...
   The Old Grey Whistl...
   Easy Tempo Vol. 1: ...
   Easy Tempo Vol. 9: ...
   Mojo Club Dancefloo...
   ...

This patch causes albums filed under <Compilations> to be sorted
alphanumerically by title.  It does not change the sort order for
albums with ALBUMARTIST set."

PA bug that resulted in hang can be worked around by draining stream

With this path, tree view updates artist name
when better one becomes available:
- if track to be added contains some sort of pretty name
  (""artistsort"", etc)
- if track to be added contains name like ""The XXX"",
  and current one is ""XXX""

(artist identity is determined by comparing raw names
 with initial ""The "" striped off)

So, from now on, the logic is:
- if any of tracks of this artist contain pretty name,
  it is used
- else, if any track contains name starting with ""The"",
  that one is used instead (after reformatting
  to something like ""XXX, The"" for better sorting)
- else, raw name is used

flyingmutant,2008-05-15 01:31:53,https://api.github.com/repos/cmus/cmus/git/commits/ac2f8240119bf06eb72843919e32712308acdcb1,ac2f8240119bf06eb72843919e32712308acdcb1,"tree: smarter artist naming and sorting [1/2]

The problem with current artists' display name selection algorithm
is that we end up using a mix of ""artist"", ""artistsort"", etc. names.
While using ""artistsort"" etc. if possible is a good thing,
displaying something like

	""The Beatles""
	...
	...
	""Prodigy, The""

or even

	""The Prodigy""
	""Prodigy, The""

is really ugly.

This patch does several things:
- introduce raw_name in struct artist
  raw_name is always initialised to ""artist"" value
  (including <No Name>, etc.)
- when searching for an artist in tree, compare
  raw_names after striping starting ""The "" off, if any
- when adding new artist to the tree, and no
  pretty artist name (""artistsort"", etc.) is available,
  transform names like ""The Beatles"" into ""Beatles, The"".
  This fixes the most common scenario, if pretty name is missing.

Case when (possibly pre-formatted) raw name is not replaced
with pretty one will be addressed in separate patch.

Store track metadata in one file (~/.cmus/cache) instead of two files
(data and index).  All data is converted to struct track_info and put
into a hash table.  This may sound like wasting memory but 582878 is not
that much when compared to size of the old index file (256561) which was
kept in memory.

Old sizes for 3263 tracks:
    327806 trackdb.dat
    256561 trackdb.idx
    584367 total

New size:
    582878 cache

This new cache consumes less memory if all tracks are in playlist
because there's no .idx data (filenames, offsets and sizes) in memory
anymore.

The new code is faster because data is read at once, not in small pieces
like the old code did.  Track metadata is hashed by filename so the
lookups should be much faster than in the old code which did binary
search over the index and then read data from the .dat file."

First line is always ""status playing/paused/stopped"".  If there's a file
available then ""file"", ""duration"", ""position"" and any collected tag
values follow (even if player is stopped).  Duration is ""-1"" if not
known.

Any newlines in filename or tags are replaced with literal \n and
backslashes with literal \\.

All commands now return text terminated with empty line.  ""status"" is
currently the only command returning anything real data.  Other commands
return just empty line (i.e. one newline)."

Since I have some .wma files in my media library, I whipped up a
plugin that utilizes ffmpeg as a decoder.  I've primarily tested it
out with the version of ffmpeg in ubuntu dapper.  However, it appears
to work fine with a recent SVN pull from ffmpeg's repository.  ffmpeg
has a somewhat noticeable memory footprint when all codecs and formats
are enabled.  I've manually registered the subset of wma-related
codecs and container formats for the version in ubuntu dapper, and
this helps significantly.   It would be nice to do this for all
versions of ffmpeg; however, its API is hardly stable...

I also have a version of the plugin that uses the stripped wma-only
version of ffmpeg from http://mcmcc.bat.ru/xmms-wma/.  This one has a
teensy memory footprint; however, I'm not sure what people think about
embedding an WMA+ASF decoder...

Since ffmpeg supports so many different formats, one could use it for
things like shorten (.shn) and realaudio files; these aren't enabled
at the moment."

Add a new tool for converting text-files to man-pages, ttman.  It is
about 300 times faster than asciidoc + xsltproc mess and has no

It can't generate .html pages but it could be done using man2html, if
anyone really cares."
