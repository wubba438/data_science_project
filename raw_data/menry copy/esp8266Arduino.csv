When a sketch needs information that is in `core_version.h`, you

Moved rebuild recipe hook for running `makecorever.py` core to run
before all _specific_ prebuild hooks. While this form of prebuild hook
is not explicitly listed, it seems like an intuitive expectation.

* Replace the SDK's use of ets_intr_lock/unlock with nestable versions

Testing has shown that there are several paths in the SDK that result in nested
calls to ets_intr_lock() / ets_intr_unlock() which may be a problem.

These functions also do not preserve the enabled interrupt level and may
result in code running with interrupts enabled when that is not intended.
This issue has recently been fixed in the Arduino code by using
xt_rsil() / xt_wsr_ps() but still exists in the Espressif SDK code.

This commit is intended to fix that and should be used in addition to the above.

The maximum nesting I have seen is 2 and lock/unlock calls appear to be balanced.
A max of 7 levels of nesting leaves plenty of room for that to change.

* make ets_intr_lock_stack uint16_t and behave like the original on over/underflow

The PS register is 15 bits, we should store the whole thing as xt_wsr_ps()
writes the whole thing.

Also if there is an underflow, we should make sure interrupts are enabled.
Same goes for overflow making sure interrupts are disabled, although this
is less important.

* Rename ets_intr_(un)lock_nest to ets_intr_(un)lock

This saves having to modify libmain.a, libpp.a and libnet80211.a to use the
nested versions.
Adjusts fix_sdk_libs.sh accordingly.

* Remove ets_intr_(un)lock from the rom .ld as we no longer use them

* ets_post() wrapper to preserve interrupt state

Add a wrapper around the ets_post code in rom to preserve the interrupt enable state.

Rather than modifying the SDK libs, rename ets_post in the .ld file and call the
wrapper ""ets_post"" to replace it.

As far as I can establish, ets_post is the only rom function in use by our code or
the SDK libs we use that causes calls to ets_intr_(un)lock.

* Add IRAM_ATTR to ets_intr_(un)lock and ets_post wrappers.

* Throw in a few comments and make ets_intr_lock_stack* static."

*   Correct critical section with interrupt level preserving and nest support
  alternative. Replace ets_intr_lock()/ets_intr_unlock() with uint32_t
  oldValue=xt_rsil(3)/xt_wrs(oldValue). Added UMM_CRITICAL_DECL macro to define
  storage for current state. Expanded UMM_CRITICAL_... to  use unique
  identifiers. This helpt facilitate gather function specific  timing
  information.

  Replace printf with something that is ROM or IRAM based so that a printf
  that occurs during an ISR malloc/new does not cause a crash. To avoid any
  reentry issue it should also avoid doing malloc lib calls.

  Refactor realloc to avoid memcpy/memmove while in critical section. This is
  only effective when realloc is called with interrupts enabled. The copy
  process alone can take over 10us (when copying more than ~498 bytes with a
  80MHz CPU clock). It would be good practice for an ISR to avoid realloc.
  Note, while doing this might initially sound scary, this appears to be very
  stable. It ran on my troublesome sketch for over 3 weeks until I got back from
  vacation and  flashed an update. Troublesome sketch - runs ESPAsyncTCP, with
  modified fauxmo emulation for 10 devices. It receives lost of Network traffic
  related to uPnP scans, which includes lots of TCP connects disconnects RSTs
  related to uPnP discovery.

  I have clocked umm_info critical lock time taking as much as 180us. A common
  use for the umm_info call is to get the free heap result. It is common
  to try and closely monitor free heap as a method to detect memory leaks.
  This may result in frequent calls to umm_info. There has not been a clear
  test case that shows an issue yet; however, I and others think they are or
  have had crashes related to this.

  I have added code that adjusts the running free heap number from _umm_malloc,
  _umm_realloc, and _umm_free. Removing the need to do a long interrupts
  disabled calculation via _umm_info.

  Build optional, min/max time measurements for locks held while in info,
  malloc, realloc, and free. Also, maintain a count of how many times each is
  called with INTLEVEL set.

* Fixed. travis build complaint.

* Changes for https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/pull/6274#pullrequestreview-259579883

* Added requested comment and missing comment for UMM_CRITICAL_PERIOD_ANALYZE.

* Updated comments and update xt_rsil()

* Moved xt_rsil&co (pulled in __STRINGIFY) definitions out of
Arduino.h, to cores/esp8266/core_esp8266_features.h
Added esp_get_cycle_count() to core_esp8266_features.h.
Updated umm_malloc and Esp.h to use new defines and location.

* Added ""#ifndef CORE_MOCK"" around conflicted area.

* Moved performance measurment and ESP specific definitions to
umm_performance.h/cpp. Removed testing asserts.

* Commented out umm analyze. Delay CRITICAL_SECTION_EXIT() in
umm_realloc() to avoid exposing a transient OOM condition to ISR.

* Missed file change. This commit has: Delay CRITICAL_SECTION_EXIT() in
umm_realloc() to avoid exposing a transient OOM condition to ISR.

* 2nd Path. Removed early release of critical section around memmove
to avoid a possible OOM for an ISR.

* improved variable name

* Resolved ISR OOM concern with `_umm_realloc()`

Updated realloc() to do a preliminary free() of unused space,
before performing a critical section exit and memmove.
This change was applied to the current _umm_realloc().
This change should reduce the risk of an ISR getting an
OOM, during a realloc memmove operation.
Added additional stats for verifying correct operation.

* Resolved ISR OOM concern in _umm_realloc()

Updated realloc() to do a preliminary free() of unused space,
before performing a critical section exit and memmove.
This change was applied to the current _umm_realloc().
This change should reduce the risk of an ISR getting an
OOM when interrupting an active realloc memmove operation.
Added additional stats for verifying correct operation.
Updated: for clarity and Travis-CI fail.

* Update to keep access to alternate printf in one file.

* Updated to use ISR safe versions of memmove, memcpy, and memset.

The library versions of memmove, memcpy, and memset were in flash.
Updated to use ROM functions ets_memmove, ets_memcpy, and ets_memset.
Additional note, the library version of memmove does not appear to
have been optimized. It took almost 10x longer than the ROM version.
Renamed printf macro to DBGLOG_FUNCTION and moved to umm_malloc_cfg.h.
Changed printf macro usage to use DBGLOG_FUNCTION.

* Update umm_malloc.cpp

Note: this is needed to stop the compiler from reordering instructions at the critical section boundary."

* Fix device test environment variables

Device tests were not connecting properly to WiFi because the
environment variables were not set when WiFi.connect was called.
This would result in tests sometimes working *if* the prior sketch run
on the ESP saved WiFi connection information and auto-connect was
enabled.  But, in most cases, the tests would simply never connect to
any WiFi and fail.

getenv() works only after BS_RUN is called (because BS_RUN handles the
actual parsing of environment variables sent from the host).

Add a ""pretest"" function to all tests which is called by the host test
controller only after all environment variables are set.  Move all
WiFi/etc. operations that were in each separate test's setup() into it.

So the order of operations for tests now is:
ESP:  setup()
      -> Set serial baud
      -> Call BS_RUN()
HOST: Send environment
      Send ""do pretest""
ESP:  pretest()
      -> Set Wifi using env. ariables, etc. return ""true"" on success
HOST: Send ""run test 1""
ESP:  Run 1st test, return result
HOST: Send ""run test 2""
ESP:  Run 2nd test, return result
<and so forth>

If nothing is needed to be set up, just return true from the pretest
function.

All tests now run and at least connect to WiFi.  There still seem to be
some actual test errors, but not because of the WiFi/environment
variables anymore.

* Remove unneeded debug prints

* Silence esptool.py output when not in V=1 mode

Esptool-ck.exe had an option to be silent, but esptool.py doesn't so the
output is very chatty and makes looking a the run logs hard (60 lines
of esptool.py output, 3 lines of actual test reports).

Redirect esptool.py STDOUT to /dev/null unless V=1 to clear this up.

* Speed up builds massively by removing old JSON

arduino-builder checks the build.options.json file and then goes off and
pegs my CPU at 100% for over a minute on each test compile checking if
files have been modified.

Simply deleting any pre-existing options.json file causes this step to
be skipped and a quick, clean recompile is done in siginificantly less
time.

* Enable compile warnings, fix any that show up

Enable all GCC warnings when building the tests and fix any that came up
(mostly signed/unsigned, unused, and deprecated ones).

* Fix UMM_MALLOC printf crash, umm_test

Printf can now handle PROGMEM addresses, so simplify and correct the
debug printouts in umm_info and elsewhere."

* Add LittleFS as internal flash filesystem

Adds a LittleFS object which uses the ARMmbed littlefs embedded filesystem,
https://github.com/ARMmbed/littlefs, to enable a new filesystem for onboard
flash utilizing the exact same API as the existing SPIFFS filesystem.

LittleFS is built for low memory systems that are subject to random power
losses, is actively supported by the ARMmbed community, supports directories,
and seems to be much faster in the large-ish read-mostly applications I use.

LittleFS, however, has a larger minimum file allocation unit and does not do
static wear levelling.  This means that for systems that need many little
files (<4K), have small SPIFFS areas (64K), or which have a large static
set of files covering the majority of flash coupled with a frequently
updated set of other files, it may not perform as well.

Simply replace SPIFFS.begin() with LittleFS.begin() in your sketch,
use LittleFS.open in place of SPIFFS.open to open files, and everything
else just works thanks to the magic of @igrr's File base class.

**LITTLEFS FLASH LAYOUT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH SPIFFS**
Since it is a completely different filesystem, you will need to reformat
your flash (and lose any data therein) to use it. Tools to build the
flash filesystem and upload are at
https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin and
https://github.com/earlephilhower/mklittlefs/ .  The mklittlefs tool
is installed as part of the Arduino platform installation, automatically.

The included example shows a contrived read-mostly example and
demonstrates how the same calls work on either SPIFFS.* or LittleFS.*
Host tests are also included as part of CI.

Directories are fully supported in LittleFS. This means that LittleFS
will have a slight difference vs. SPIFFS when you use
LittleFS.openDir()/Dir.next().  On SPIFFS dir.next()
will return all filesystem entries, including ones in ""subdirs""
(because in SPIFFS there are no subdirs and ""/"" is the same as any
other character in a filename).

On LittleFS, dir.next() will only return entries in the directory
specified, not subdirs.  So to list files in ""/subdir/..."" you need
to actually openDir(""/subdir"") and use Dir.next() to parse through
just those elements.  The returned filenames also only have the
filename returned, not full paths.  So on a FS with ""/a/1"", ""/a/2""
when you do openDir(""/a""); dir.next().getName(); you get ""1"" and ""2""
and not ""/a/1"" and ""/a/2"" like in SPIFFS.  This is consistent with
POSIX ideas about reading directories and more natural for a FS.

Most code will not be affected by this, but if you depend on
openDir/Dir.next() you need to be aware of it.

Corresponding ::mkdir, ::rmdir, ::isDirectory, ::isFile,
::openNextFile, and ::rewind methods added to Filesystem objects.
Documentation has been updated with this and other LittleFS information.

Subdirectories are made silently when they do not exist when you
try and create a file in a subdir.  They are silently removed when
the last file in them is deleted.  This is consistent with what
SPIFFS does but is obviously not normal POSIX behavior.  Since there
has never been a ""FS.mkdir()"" method this is the only way to be
compatible with legacy SPIFFS code.

SPIFFS code has been refactored to pull out common flash_hal_* ops
and placed in its own namespace, like LittleFS.

* Fix up merge blank line issue

* Merge in the FSConfig changs from SDFS PR

Enable setConfig for LittleFS as well plys merge the SPIFFS changes
done in the SDFS PR.

* Fix merge errors

* Update to use v2-alpha branch

The V2-alpha branch supports small file optimizations which can help
increase the utilization of flash when small files are prevalent.
It also adds support for metadata, which means we can start adding
things like file creation times, if desired (not yet).

* V2 of littlefs is now in upstream/master

* Update test to support non-creation-ordered files

In a directory, the order in which ""readNextFile()"" will return a name
is undefined.  SPIFFS may return it in order, but LittleFS does not as
of V2.  Update the test to look for files by name when doing
readNextFile() testing.

* Fix LittleFS.truncate implementation

* Fix SDFS tests

SDFS, SPIFFS, and LittleFS now all share the same common set of tests,
greatly increasing the SDFS test coverage.

* Update to point to mklittlefs v2

Upgrade mklittlefs to V2 format support

* Remove extra FS::write(const char *s) method

This was removed in #5861 and erroneously re-introduced here.

* add regular scheduled functions, now also callable on `yield()`

added bool schedule_function_us(std::function<bool(void)> fn, uint32_t repeat_us)
lambda must return true to be not removed from the schedule function list
if repeat_us is 0, then the function is called only once.

Legacy schedule_function() is preserved

This addition allows network drivers like ethernet chips on lwIP to be regularly called
- even if some user code loops on receiving data without getting out from main loop
  (callable from yield())
- without the need to call the driver handling function
  (transparent)

After completing handshake in BSSL, server is already verified and X509 context is no longer needed. Depending on verification method it save more or less heap space.

* Bugfix: Report not connected if there is no ready data and TLS connection is broken

Added the change for reporting not connected if TLS session is broken and there is no more buffered decrypted data. TLS can be broken if message authentication (MAC) cannot be verified. BearSSL enters BR_SSL_CLOSED state when processing invalid encrypted application data fragment. In such situation the current implementation get stuck forever unless user has own timeout mechanism build on top of WiFiClientSecureBearSSL.

* Split IRAM into 2 linker sections to move std::fcn

Callbacks need to be placed in IRAM when being called from an IRQ (like
the SPISlave callbacks).

This can be done by hacking the std::functional header and making every
single specialization of the template into an IRAM section, which would
take a lot of space for no benefit in the majority of cases.

The alternate is to specify the single instantiation types/operators
required, but the problem is the flash segment matcher would match them
before the IRAM section was begun, and rules for them would just not be
applied.

Get around this by splitting the IRAM section definition into .text and
.text1.  This is linker syntactic sugar and does not actually change the
on-chip layout.  But it does allow us to put the exception vectors at
the required absolute addresses and add single functions to IRAM.

* Add .text1 segment to space used calculation in IDE

* All functional callers are now placed in IRAM

* Write out the .text1 segment to the BIN

The extra segment name needs to be placed into the output binary as
well, or else only the init code gets stored and none of the real app is
present.  This leads to an infinite boot loop.

This change adds in the segment to the generated image."

ref: d-a-v/esp82xx-nonos-linklayer#31
origin: #5902
me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP#108

Following the links above is instructive.
To summarize:

    * currently and from a long time lwIP tcp client connections always uses the same tcp source port number right after boot
    * this port number is increased everytime a new one is needed (= new tcp client connection)
      (to be noted, linux has the same increasing behavior)
    * when connecting to the same server (right after boot), the triplet (esp-ip-address, source port, destination port) are the same, and may hit remote server list of sockets in time-wait-state (previous connection unproperly closed from the same esp). Consequently the new connection fails when it happens.
    * this is happening only when debugging (esp reboots often, in less time than time-wait expiration), so the nasty effect is amplified especially when bugs are being chased
    * efforts had been done when espressif's lwIP implementation wasn't open source, with WiFiClient::setLocalPortStart() #632 but it must be explicitely called with a different random number at every reboot. Efficient but not ideal.

This PR uses espressif firmware's r_rand() everytime a new local source port is needed. A different source port number is now showed by tcpdump right after boot. Source port range and duplication is verified everytime in lwIP's src/core/tcp.c:tcp_new_port(). It is implemented as a local patch for upstream lwIP so it is valid not only with WiFiClient but also with @me-no-dev's Async libraries (they don't use WiFiClient).

WiFiClient::setLocalPortStart() is still usable with the same effects as before."

* Fix String::replace() 

Fixes #5883 and supercedes #5890

The replace() function was using len() while in the middle of buffer
operations.  In SSO mode len() is not stored separately and is a call to
strlen(), which may not be legal if you're in the middle of overwriting
the SSO buffer, as was the case in ::replace when the replacement string
was longer than the find string.  This caused potential garbage at the
end of the string when accessed.  Instead, just cache the length in a
local while doing the operation.

Add in test cases from #5890 as well as some new ones that fail on the
unmodified core.

* Fix stack smashing error on 64b

When pointers are 8 bytes long, the size of a String is larger than 16
chars.  Increase the allocated array we're using in the test to avoid a
""stack smashing"" error.

* Manually call destructor in test

Just for clarity, manually call the destructor for the Strings() that
are ""placement new'd"" in the String tests.  It is a no-op for the
existing test, since thanks to SSO there are no memory allocations, but
will help in case someone adds tests later which include longer strings."

* Add a FAT filesystem for SD cards to Arduino FS

Arduino forked a copy of SD lib several years ago, put their own wrapper
around it, and it's been languishing in our ESP8266 libraries ever since
as SD. It doesn't support long file names, has class names which
conflict with the ESP8266 internal names, and hasn't been updated in
ages.

The original author of the SD library has continued work in the
meantime, and produced a very feature rich implementation of SdFat. It
unfortunately also conflicts with the class names we use in ESP8266
Arduino and has a different API than the internal SPIFFS or proposed
LittleFS filesystem objects.

This PR puts a wrapper around the latest and greatest SdFat library,
by forking it and wrapping its classes in a private namespace ""sdfat,""
and making as thin a wrapper as possible around it to conform to
the ESP8266 FS, File, and Dir classes.

This PR also removes the Arduino SD.h class library and rewrites it
using the new SDFS filesystem to make everything in the ESP8266
Arduino core compatible with each other.

By doing so it lets us use a single interface for anything needing a
file instead of multiple ones (see SDWebServer and how a different
object is needed vs. one serving from SPIFFS even though the logic is
all the same). Same for BearSSL's CertStores and probably a few others
I've missed, cleaning up our code base significantly.

Like LittleFS, silently create directories when a file is created with
a subdirectory specifier (""/path/to/file.txt"") if they do not yet exist.

Adds a blacklist of sketches to skip in the CI process (because SdFat
has many examples which do not build properly on the ESP8266).

Now that LittleFS and SDFS have directory support, the FS needs to be
able to communicate whether a name is one or the other.  Add a simple
bool FS::isDirectory() and bool FS::isFile() method.  SPIFFS doesn't
have directories, so if it's valid it's a file and reported as such.

Add ::mkdir/::rmdir to the FS class to allow users to make and destroy
subdirectories.  SPIFFS directory operations will, of course, fail
and return false.

Emulate a 16MB SD card and allow test runner to exercise it by using
a custom SdFat HOST_MOCK-enabled object.

Throw out the original Arduino SD.h class and rewrite from scratch using
only the ESP8266 native SDFS calls.  This makes ""SD"" based applications
compatible with normal ESP8266 ""File"" and ""FS"" and ""SPIFFS"" operations.

The only major visible change for users is that long filenames now are
fully supported and work without any code changes.  If there are static
arrays of 11 bytes for old 8.3 names in code, they will need to be
adjusted.

While it is recommended to use the more powerful SDFS class to access SD
cards, this SD.h wrapper allows for use of existing Arduino libraries
which are built to only with with that SD class.

Additional helper functions added to ESP8266 native Filesystem:: classes
to help support this portability.

The rewrite is good enough to run the original SDWebServer and SD
example code without any changes.

* Add a FSConfig and SDFSConfig param to FS.begin()

Allows for configuration values to be passed into a filesystem via the
begin method.  By default, a FS will receive a nullptr and should so
whatever is appropriate.

The base FSConfig class has one parameter, _autoFormat, set by the
default constructor to true.

For SPIFFS, you can now disable auto formatting on mount failure by
passing in a FSConfig(false) object.

For SDFS a SDFSConfig parameter can be passed into config specifying the
chip select and SPI configuration.  If nothing is passed in, the begin
will fail since there are no safe default values here.

* Add FS::setConfig to set FS-specific options

Add a new call, FS::setConfig(const {SDFS,SPIFFS}Config *cfg), which
takes a FS-specific configuration object and copies any special settings
on a per-FS basis.  The call is only valid on unmounted filesystems, and
checks the type of object passed in matches the FS being configured.

Updates the docs and tests to utilize this new configuration method.

* Add ::truncate to File interface

Fixes #3846

* Use polledTimeout for formatting yields, cleanup

Use the new polledTimeout class to ensure a yield every 5ms while
formatting.

Add in default case handling and some debug messages when invalid inputs
specified.

* Make setConfig take const& ref, cleaner code

setConfig now can take a parameter defined directly in the call by using
a const &ref to it, leading to one less line of code to write and
cleaner reading of the code.

Also clean up SDFS implementation pointer definition."

  This PR replaces the high level Serial mock with a more complete
  UART driver. This way the HardwareSerial works without any
  modifications. Additionally the driver supports UART0 and UART1
  at the same time (UART0 is directed to stdout and UART1 writes
  to stderr). RX is implemented by switching the terminal into raw
  non-blocking mode and injecting each key-press directly into the
  FIFO of UART0. A new command line switch -c was added to ignore
  CTRL-C and send it via serial as well. The decumentation was
  updated accordingly.

This commit allows switching SDK firmware:

nonos-sdk-pre-v3 shipped with release 2.5.0 has issues:

    * Some boards show erratic behavior (radio connection is quickly lost), with an unknown cause.
      These boards work well with previous nonos-sdk-2.2.1 firmware (#5736)

    * Overall performances seem to have decreased (#5513)

This PR restores sdk2.2.1 (as in core-2.4.2).

SDK-pre-3.0 - which has brought long awaited fixes (WiFi sleep modes) - is still available through a menu option available only with generic board.

BREAKING

    * new define `-DNONOSDK221=1` or `-DNONOSDK3V0=1`

    * for external build systems: new library directory: `tools/sdk/lib/<version>/lib`

* Add esptool.py, pyserial, and python to JSON

Add installation of python on Win32/Win64, and on all systems install
esptool.py and pyserial.

* Initial esptool.py upload test

* First successfull esptool.py upload

* Patch in verbose flag operation

* Replace esptool-ck.exe with Python equivalent

Remove need for binary esptool-ck.exe by implementing the same logic as
esptool-ck uses in Python.  Only image creation is supported, and only
in the Arduino standard mode (with its custom bootloader and ROM
layout).

* Remove all esptool-ck.exe, hook Windows Python

Remove all references to esptool-ck and use Python on Windows and Linux
for all recipes where possible.

* Use python to make core_version as well

Avoid ugly bash and CMD.exe tricks in platform.txt by using python to
make the core_version header.

* Rename conflicting script, clean up packager

* Windows test passes

Need to make sure Python2 and Python3 compatible and paths are munged
properly to avoid eaccidentally escaping things when calling esptool.py

Able to compile, build a BIN and upload via esptool.py on a Windows
machine without Python installed globally, only as part of the Arduino
tools package.

* Use github sources for pyserial

* Erase calibration or all flash before programming

Add back in erase support by calling esptool.py twice (since it does not
support chained operations like esptool-ck.exe).

* Make 460K default speed, remove 961K

961K doesn't seem to work with esptool, so make 460K the default upload
speed and remove 961K.

Even at this lower speed, esptool.py is much faster to upload (even
before taking into account the compression when doing things like SPIFFS
and code upload).

* Make erase and upload work again

Arduino does not support a upload.#.cmd pattern, so we need to do
everything in a single command line.  Make it cleaner by introducing a
Python wrapper script which will run the same executable with different
sets of commands (since we need to erase a block w/a separate invocation
from the real upload).

Update boards.txt to use the new options format, placing the esptool
command as ""version"" when there is no ""erase_flash"" or ""erase_region"" to
be done to keep things simple.

* Move esptool/pyserial to submodules

Since esptool.py and pyserial are coming directly from github repos,
there is no need to include them as a tool in package.json.

* Restore 921K upload opt, silent downgrade to 460k

To enable full backward compatibility, restore the 921k option for
upload speed but silently change it to 460k in the upload.py script.

Add error checking on upload.py"

Adding the Arduino repo as a git submodule can be very useful for version control. However, `git submodule update` is not enough, as the tools need to be downloaded through `get.py`. Wrapping the main code in that script into its own function allows an external Python script to import the module and execute its functionality without relying on the unsafe `execfile` (or `Popen`).

* Allow unaligned input/output to SPI::transferBytes

Fixes #4967

Support any alignment of input and output pointers and transfer lengths
in SPI::transferBytes.  Use 32-bit transfers and FIFO as much as
possible.

* Refactor misaligned transfer, avoid RMW to FIFO

The SPI FIFO can't properly do RMW (i.e. bytewise updates) because when
you read the FIFO you are actually reading the SPI read data, not what
was written into the write FIFO.

Refactor the transferBytes to take account of this.  For aligned input
and outputs, perform as before (but handle non-x4 sizes properly).  For
misaligned inputs, if it's unidirectional then do bytewise until the
direction data pointer is aligned and then do 32b accesses.  Fod
bidirectional and misaligned inputs, copy the output data to an aligned
buffer, do the transfer, then copy the read back data from temp aligned
buffer to the real input buffer.

* Fix comments, clean condition checks, save stack

Add more comments and adjust naming to be more informative in
transferBytes_ and *aligned_.  Save 64bytes of stack in double
misaligned case.

* Optimize misaligned transfers, reduce code size

On any misaligned input or output, always use a temp buffer.  No need
for special casing and bytewise ::transfer().  This should be faster as
bytewise ::transfer involves a significant number of IO register
accesses and setup.  Thanks to @devyte for the suggestion."

Because the constructors of the BSSL client and server add a reference
count to the stack_thunk, if there is no copy constructor defined then
the stack thunk reference count can get out of sync causing the stack
thunk memory to be freed while still in use.  That could cause random
crashes or hangs.

Add a very basic copy constructor to the WiFiClientSecure and
WiFiServerSecure objects, using the default operator= to duplicate
simple types and shared_ptr classes.

The _cipher_list element (used only w/custom ciphers) could be freed
while still in use if copies of the WiFiClientSecure object were made.

Use a shared_ptr which will only free when the last reference is
deleted.

The axTLS compatibility mode calls allocate and store elements needed
for SSL connections (unlike normal BearSSL calls).  These elements could
be freed mistakenly while still in use if copies of the WiFiClientSecure
were made by the app.

Convert to a separately managed shared_ptr to ensure they live as long
as any referencing objects before deletion.

Same done for the axTLS compatability for WiFiServerSecure."

* Add full gdb support with uart/Serial integration

* Fix GDB merge errors

* Update to unpatched GDB protocol specification

It appears that Espressif patched the open source xtensa GDB port in
order to build their old GDB executable and their old gdbstub (basically
removing any register in a generic xtensa and only leaving those
present in the chip they synthesized).  Their GDBStub also assumed this
behavior.

Unpatched upstream GNU GDB now expects all the registers in
xtensa-config.c to be sent/read on a 'g' command.  Change the GDB stub
to send ""xxxxxxxx""s (legal per the spec) for unimplemented registers.
This makes the 'g' response much longer, but it's results are cached
and in an interactive debugger it isn't noticeable.

* Fix .iram.literal to come before .iram.text for GDB

* Move functions to flash, call using wrappers

All functions which are not interrupt or exception called are now in
flash. A small IRAM wrapper enables flash when processing main GDB ops
by calling Cache_Read_Enable_New() and then jumping to the main flash
code.  This seems to work for catching exceptions, data and code breaks,
and Ctrl-C.

The UART ISR handler and exception handler register-saving bits of
code in ASM are still in IRAM.

GDB IRAM usage is now about 670 bytes.

* Remove LWIP2 builder commit

* Add documentation and gdbstub_init header

Add some simple GDB documentation to the main tree showing a worked
example.

Adds the definition of `void gdbstub_init()` to <GDBStub.h>

* Clean up GDB include and library dir

Replace GDBstub.h with the version in the internal/ directory, and
adjust stub code accordingly.  This way, only one copy of a file called
""GDBstub.h"" will exist.

Update the gdbcommands and replace the obsolete ESPRESSIF readme with
@kylefleming's version since we're mainly doing serial, not TCP,
connected debugging.

Bump the library rev. number since this is a pretty big functionality
change.

Minor documentation tweak.

* Undo much of UART refactoring, set fifo IRQ to 16

Remove the refactoring of pin control and other little things not directly
related to GDB processing.  Should greatly reduce the diff size in uart.c.
Should also remove any register value changes (intended or otherwise)
introduced in the original PR from @kylefleming.

Set the FIFO interrupt to 16 chars when in GDB mode, matching the latest
UART configuration for highest speed.

* Add architecture comments, cleanup uart.c code

Comments added to UART.c trying to explain (as best as I understand it)
the changes done to support GDB and how they interact with standard
operation.

Fix the uart_uninit to stop the ISR and then free appropriately.

Fix uart_isr_handle_data (GDB's shim for sending chars to the 8266 app)
to do the exact same thing as the standard UART handler including set
the overflow properly and either discard or overwrite in that case.

Fix serial reception when GDB enabled by enabling the user recv ISR.

Remove commented attributes from gdbstub, leftover from the move to
flash.

General logic cleanup per comments in the PR.

* Also set the UART flags for HW error in GDB

Ensure we also check the UART flags and set the uart status
appropriately when in GDB mode."

* Make waveform generator a NMI to run always

Make the waveform generator an NMI using the same code as in 2.4.0.
Making it NMI will ensure it runs even when interrupts are disabled.

Fixes #5568

* Move to a lockless waveform generator

Make the waveform generator lockless by doing all dangerous structure
updates in the interrupt handler.  start/stopWaveform set a flag and
cause an interrupt.  They wait for the interrupt to complete and clear
those flags before returning.

Also rework the Waveform[] array to be lockless.

* Optimize IRAM and CPU usage in IRQ

Try and minimize the IRAM needed to run the IRQ while keeping performance at
or better than before.

* Avoid WDT errors, optimize pin scans

Calculate first and last pins to scan for PWM, significantly increasing
accuracy for pulses under 10us at 80MHz.  Now if you are using a single
PWM channel at 80MHz you can generate a 1.125us pulse (down from ~4us).

Rework the IRQ logic to avoid potential WDT errors.  When at 80MHz it
appears that interrupts occuring faster than 10us apart on the timer
cause WDT errors.  Avoid it by increasing the minimum delay between
IRQs on the timer accordingly.

* Clean up format/comment, remove delay() in stop

stopWaveform may be called from an interrupt (it's called by digitalWrite)
so we can't call delay().  Make it a busy wait for the IRQ to clear the
waveform.

Only set a new timeout of 10us when starting a new waveform when there
is no other event coming sooner than that.

Update formatting and comments per @devyte's requests.

* DNSServer: Handle examplewww.com correctly

Just replacing 'www.' with the empty string when we assign the
domainname will remove all occurrences of 'www.', not just those
at the start of the string.

Change this to a startsWith check so that only ""www."" at the
beginning of the string is removed.

* DNSServer: Rework request handling

Rewrite the request handling in the DNSServer code to address the
following issues:

Compatibility with EDNS #1:

   RFC6891 says that
     ""Responders that choose not to implement the protocol
      extensions defined in this document MUST respond with a
      return code (RCODE) of FORMERR to messages containing an
      OPT record in the additional section and MUST NOT include an
      OPT record in the response""

   If we have any additional records in the request, then we need
   to return a FORMERR, and not whatever custom error code the user
   may have set.

Compatibility with EDNS #2:

   If we're returning an error, we need to explicitly zero all of
   the record counters. In the existing code, if there is an
   additional record present in the request, we return an ARCOUNT
   of 1 in the response, despite including no additional records
   in the payload.

Don't answer non-A requests

   If we receive an AAAA request (or any other non-A record)
   requests, we shouldn't respond to it with an A record.

Don't answer non-IN requests

   If we receive a request for a non-IN type, don't answer it
   (it's unlikely that we'd see this in the real world)

Don't read off the end of malformed packets

   If a packet claims to have a query, but then doesn't include
   one, or includes a query with malformed labels, don't read off
   the end of the allocated data structure.

* DNSServer: Clarify and tidy writing the answer record

Modify the code used to write the answer record back to the server
so that it is clearer that we are writing network byte order
16-bit quantities, and to clarify what's happening with the pointer
used at the start of the answer."

* Move to PROGMEM aware libc, allow PSTR in printf()

A Newlib (libc) patch is in progress to move the _P functions from inside
Arduino into first-class citizens in libc.  This Arduino patch cleans up
code that's been migrated there.  Binaries for the new libs are included
because it seems they're part of the Arduino git tree, and should be
replaced with @igrr built ones when/if the Newlib changes are accepted.

Notable changes/additions for Arduino:
Allow for use of PROGMEM based format and parameter strings in all
*printf functions.  No need for copying PSTR()s into RAM before printing
them out (transparently saves heap space when using _P functions) and
makes it easier to print out constant strings for applications.

Add ""%S"" (capital-S) format that I've been told, but cannot verify,
is used in Arduino to specify a PROGMEM string parameter in printfs,
as an alias for ""%s"" since plain ""%s"" can now handle PROGMEM.

Optimized the memcpy_P, strnlen_P, and strncpy_P functions to use 32-bit
direct reads whenver possible (source and dest alignment mediated), but
there is still room for improvement in others.

Finally, move several constant arrays from RODATA into PROGMEM and
update their accessors.  Among these are the ctype array, ~260 bytes,
mprec* arrays, ~300 bytes, and strings/daycounts in the time
formatting functions, ~200 bytes.  All told, sketches will see from
300 to 800 additional RAM heap free on startup (depending on their
use of these routines).

* Fix merge error in #ifdef/#endif

* Fix host test using the newlib generic pgmspace.h

Host tests now use the sys/pgmspace.h for compiles instead of the
ESP8266-specific version.

* Update with rebuilt libraries using latest newlib

* Include binaries built directly from @igrr repo

Rebuild the binaries using a git clone of
https://github.com/igrr/newlib-xtensa

* Fix merge define conflict in c_types.h

* Fix strlen_P misaligned source error

Include fix from newlib-xtensa/fix-strlen branch cleaning up misaligned
access on a non-aligned source string.

* Fix strlen_P and strcpy_P edge cases

Ran the included test suite on ESP8266 tstring.c with the following defines:
 #define MAX_1 50
 #define memcmp memcmp_P
 #define memcpy memcpy_P
 #define memmem memmem_P
 #define memchr memchr_P
 #define strcat strcat_P
 #define strncat strncat_P
 #define strcpy strcpy_P
 #define strlen strlen_P
 #define strnlen strnlen_P
 #define strcmp strcmp_P
 #define strncmp strncmp_P

Uncovered edge case and return value problems in the optimized versions of
the strnlen_P and strncpy_P functions.  Corrected.

* Fix memcpy_P return value

memcpy-1.c test suite showed error in return value of memcpy_P.  Correct it.

* Fix strnlen_P/strlen_P off-by-4 error

Random crashes, often on String constructors using a PSTR, would occur due
to the accelerated strnlen_P going past the end of the string. Would make
debug builds fail, too (ESP.getVersionString() failure).

Fix to fall through to normal copy on a word that's got a 0 byte anywhere
in it.

* Add device tests for libc functional verification

Add test suite used to debug libc optimized _P functions to the device
tests.

* Rebuild from igrr's repo (same source as prior)

Rebuild .a from igrr's repo at 347260af117b4177389e69fd4d04169b11d87a97

* WIP - add exceptions

* Fix exception to have 0-terminator

* Move some exception constants to TEXT from RODATA

* Remove throw stubs

* Move more exception stuff to ROM

* Enable exceptions in platform.io

* Remove atexit, is duplicated in rebuilt lib

Need to look at the quick-toolchain options, there seems to be a definition
for atexit defined there (libgcc?) that needs to be excised.  For now,
remove our local do-nothing copy.

* Update libgcc to remove soft-fp functions

The esp-quick-toolchain generated libgcc.a needed to have the soft-FP routines
that are in ROM removed from it.  Remove them in the new esp-quick-toolchain
and update.

* Fix merge typos in Makefile

* Add unhandled exception handler to postmortem

* Return our atexit() handler

* Latest stdc++, minimize exception emercengy area

* Remove atexit from newlib

atexit was defined in newlib strongly, but we also define a noop atexit in core.
Since we never exit, use the core's noop and delete the atexit from libc.a

Updated in esp-quick-toolchain as well.

* Move __FUNCTION__ static strings to PROGMEM

__FUNCTION__ is unlikely to be a timing sensitive variable, so move it to
PROGMEM and not RODATA (RAM) using linker magic.

asserts() now should take no RAM for any strings.

* Clean up linker file, update to latest stdc++

* Update to latest stdc++ which doesn't call strerror

* Update to GCC5.1 exception emergency allocator

Using GCC 5.1's emergency memory allocator for exceptions, much less
space is required in programs which do not use exceptions and when
space is allocated it is managed more efficiently.

* Initial try with new compiler toolchain

* Include newlib built from esp-quick-toolchain

* Update JSON with all new esp-quick-toolchain builds

* Use 64bit Windows compiler on 64bit Windows

* Dump std::exception.what() when possible

When doing the panic on unhandled exceptions, try and grab the
.what() pointer and dump it as part of the termination info.
Makes it easy to see mem errors (std::bad_alloc) or std::runtime_error
strings.

* Use scripted install from esp-quick-toolchain

Makes sure proper libraries and includes are present by using a
scripted installation from esp-quick-install instead of a manual
one.

* Update eqk to remove atexit, fix packaging diff"

Using a pluggable architecture, allow updates delivered via the Update
class to be verified as signed by a certificate.  By using plugins, avoid
pulling either axTLS or BearSSL into normal builds.

A signature is appended to a binary image, followed by the size of the
signature as a 32-bit int.  The updater takes a verification function
and checks this signature using whatever method it chooses, and if it
fails the update is not applied.

A SHA256 hash class is presently implemented for the signing hash (since
MD5 is a busted algorithm).

A BearSSLPublicKey based verifier is implemented for RSA keys.  The
application only needs the Public Key, while to sign you can use
OpenSSL and your private key (which should never leave your control
or be deployed on any endpoints).

An example using automatic signing is included.

Update the docs to show the signing steps and how to use it in the
automatic and manual modes.

Also remove one debugging line from the signing tool.

Saves ~600 bytes when in debug mode by moving strings to PMEM

Windows can't run the signing script, nor does it normally have OpenSSL
installed.  When trying to build an automatically signed binary, warn
and don't run the python."

I recently starting playing around with a few esp8266-01s and tried to use the SSDP libraries to work with Smarthings discovery:

https://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/cloud-and-lan-connected-device-types-developers-guide/building-lan-connected-device-types/building-the-service-manager.html

on the docs there are example grovy files that do simple service discovery, i was not able to get SSDP to work correctly, though i was able to find some other projects that did (python fauxmo works for alexa, but with modifications i was able to make it work for custom devices in ST).

after digging to figure out why the python code was working and the ESP SSDP lib was not i noticed there is a string comparison in the grovy file and it was failing to match the udn with the original usn device id. The ST groovy code could be changed to remedy this problem but i wonder if it should be fixed here, because so many other examples of SSDP discovery take care in ensuring the usn and udn match exactly.

___________

Summary, I think the USN and UDN values should match exactly. This will fix issues, allowing for much easier integration with smart hubs that need the device  ids to match. Allowing me to use these libraries and not need to roll a custom SSDP handler."

* Update to BearSSL 0.6+ release, add AES_CCM modes

modes to the encryption options.

* Remove #ifdefs in .S file, not needed.

* Remove #ifdef code changes, ensure same code as PC

Remove ""#ifdef ESP8266;...;#else;...;#endif"" brackets in BearSSL to
ensure the host-tested code is the same as the ESP8266-run code.

* Move to latest BearSSL w/EC progmem savings

* Merge with master

* Add br_thunk_* calls to do ref counting, painting

Add reference counting br_thunk_add/del_ref() to replace stack handling code
in the class.

Add in stack painting and max usage calculation.

* Add in postmortem stack dump hooks

When a crash occurs while in the second stack, dump the BSSL stack and
then also the stack that it was called from (either cont or sys).

* Update stack dump to match decoder expectations

* Move thunk to code core for linkiage

The thunk code needs to be visible to the core routines, so move it to the
cores/esp8266 directory.  Probably need to refactor the stack setup and the
bearssl portion to avoid dependency on bearssl libs in cores/esp8266

* Add 2nd stack dump utility routine

* Refactor once more, update stack size, add stress

Make stack_thunks generic, remove bearssl include inside of cores/esp8266.

Allocate the stack on a WiFiServerSecure object creation to avoid
fragmentation since we will need to allocate the stack to do any
connected work, anyway.

A stress test is now included which checks the total BearSSL second
stack usage for a variety of TLS handshake and certificate options
from badssl.org.

* Update to latest to-thunks branch

* Add BearSSL device test using stack stress

Run a series of SSL connection and transmission tests that stress
BearSSL and its stack usage to the device tests.

Modify device tests to include a possible SPIFFS generation and
upload when a make_spiffs.py file is present in a test directory.

* Use bearssl/master branch, not /to-thunks branch

changes."

* Allow GPIO 9 and 10 for waveform generation

While most ESP8266 modules use quad-io mode for their SPI flash ROM,
there are some which only use dual-io mode.  Allow the unused pins
(GPIO 9 and 10) to have waveforms generated on them.  Should the user try
this on a quad-io mode board, expect very bad things to happen.

* Add variant for 8285 to init GPIO 9/10

The 8285 only has 2-bit flash IO, so the other two pins can be used as
inputs (9/10).  Set them to input to mirror the way other pins are set
up.

* Update waveform gen to only allow 9/10 on 8285

Update the common.h in both generic (remove TODO, it's done!) and the
8285 variant to make isFlashInterfacePin macro correct.  Use that macro
to disable pins 9 and 10 in the common, non-8285 case."

As part of the ""clear connection configuration for reused objects""

WiFiClient, unfortunately, calls ::stop as part of the connection
process, so all of these settings were lost.

been connected.

* Make mesh network actually usable. Make mesh network use static IP during initial connection to speed up connection time. Add separate handlers for requests and responses. Add network password. Provide more detailed code example. Add optional verbose mode. Improve comments. Add readme file.

* Fix compiler warnings. Fix code style of HelloMesh.ino to avoid upsetting Travis.

* Remove stray spaces.

* Make mesh network WiFi password settable via the ESP8266WiFiMesh constructor. Make use of static IP optional by moving static IP initialization code to setStaticIP method. Increase scanning interval from one to two seconds in the HelloMesh.ino example to increase chances of successful connections. Update comments. Update README.rst.

* Increase specificity in the conditions of the waitForClientTransmission method (renamed from waitForClient) to avoid issues related to #4626 , #4728 and #4754 in the future.

* Improve most parts of the library to achieve better performance and greatly increase flexibility.

Changes:
* Make WiFi-connection related variables static to allow for the use of multiple ESP8266WiFiMesh instances on a single node (useful e.g. when communicating with several different mesh networks).
* Make it possible to choose AP port, which is helpful when using multiple ESP8266WiFiMesh AP:s on a single node.
* Add user-customizable network filter.
* Make activation of own AP optional for each mesh node.
* Add ways to change mesh network name and node id for existing ESP8266WiFiMesh instances.
* Add verboseModePrint method to clean up the code.
* Add reactivation of static IP after successful data transfers to speed up re-connection attempts.
* Add empty_IP constant which can be used to check if static IP is disabled for a ESP8266WiFiMesh instance.
* Remove the WiFiClient _client class variable in ESP8266WiFiMesh since there is no need to save _client in the class instance.
* Add transmission status as a return value from attemptTransmission.
* Pass calling ESP8266WiFiMesh instance pointer to callback functions to allow for greater range of actions in callbacks.
* Make transmission message a class variable to allow it to be stored in the class and accessed from callbacks.
* Add getters for mesh name and node id to ESP8266WiFiMesh.
* Add getter and setter for networkFilter to ESP8266WiFiMesh.
* Increase range of available node_id:s by changing the type to String and adding functions to convert between String and uint64_t using a customizable radix between 2 and 36.
* Make it possible to connect to several nodes during each attemptTransmission call.
* Add static connection_queue and latest_transmission_outcomes vectors to the ESP8266WiFiMesh class, a NetworkInfo class and a TransmissionResult class to aid in bookkeeping when connecting to several AP:s during one attemptTransmission call.
* Make wifi_channel and BSSID optional when connecting to an AP (though excluding them will slow down the connection process).
* Add optional scan and static ip optimizations available in Arduino core for ESP8266 version 2.4.2.
* Add functions to check lwIP version in order to enable WiFi optimizations only available with lwIP2.
* Add concluding_disconnect, initial_disconnect and no_scan options to the attemptTransmission method.
* Update documentation.

* Improve README.rst formatting.

* Further improve README.rst.

* Even further improve README.rst.

* Make source code comments Doxygen compatible. Improve README file and change its file format to .md.

* Add temporary compatibility layer to ensure backwards compatibility with the old mesh network library API until the next major core release (2.5.0).

* Polish documentation slightly.

* Add scan_all_wifi_channels option to attemptTransmission method.

* - Add getter and setter for the WiFi channel of a ESP8266WiFiMesh instance.
- Separate methods for changing mesh name and node id from AP control methods.
- Add methods getAPController and isAPController to better handle situations when multiple ESP8266WiFiMesh instances take turns to be in control of the AP.
- Create separate UtilityMethods.cpp file for utility methods.
- Improve code efficiency and robustness, e.g. by passing arguments by reference instead of by value for non-POD types and employing typedefs.
- Update README.md.

* Make the code more stylish.

* Update README.md with the new ESP8266WiFiMesh constructor documentation.

* Make attemptScan method in CompatibilityLayer use reference as argument.

* Make it possible to use const String as argument to attemptScan.

* - Make code use camelCase instead of snake_case.
- Improve documentation.

* Rename Uint64ToString to uint64ToString and StringToUint64 to stringToUint64, since they are methods."

* Add valgrind and string tests to host_tests

Valgrind identified an error that was causing intermittent failures in
the host tests, and can check for subtle memory access and allocation bugs.
Add it to the standard host_test suite, and any errors will cause test
failure.

Also start adding string tests, since two undefined behaviors have been
found so far just by inspection.

* Add additional String tests

expected behavior.

* Remove verbose from valgrind run

No need to be so chatty on the test.  Errors were a little hard to spot.
Go to normal verbosity.

* Add lcov and more string tests

LCOV and genhtml can generate nice HTML coverage charts hilighting test
coverage issues in a much simpler way than gcov text format.  Generate these
automatically from gcov output.

As @devyte noticed, PR #4955 has an issue when you catenate a string to

however, reserve() would 0-terminate by default.

When a string is concatted to itself, the pointer to its c_str can change
due to realloc().  This would invalidate the passed-in pointer being
concatted, and cause a use-after-free error.  Special case this to avoid
the issue.  Now ""a += a;"" works properly.

Also use sprintf(%{l}d) instead of non-POSIX ltoa/itoa calls to construct a
string from a signed number (in base 10 only).  The non-posix versions don't
handle INT_MIN properly on either host_tests or on the ESP8266."

Due to popular demand, remove the hardcoded dependency on SPIFFS
or SD from the CertStore by factoring out the file interface into
a new class (CertStoreFile) that the user will need to implement
as a thin wrapper around either a SPIFFS.file or a SD.file

Combine the downloaded certificates into a UNIX ""ar"" archive
and parse that on-the-fly to allow easy inspection and creation
of the Cert Store database.

Examples updated with a new certificate downloader that creates
the certs.ar archive and with a single sample that can be built
for either SPIFFS or SD with a #define.  Users can copy the
implementation of the CertStoreFile they need to their own code
as it is self-contained.

Also move the CertStore to the BearSSL namespace and remove the
suffix and separate SPIFFS/SD sources.

Remove the ""deep+"" change from the CI build as well (no special
options needed on any PIO or makefile build).

We'll revisit the filesystem wrapper for 2.5.0, hopefully having a
unified template for both filesystem usage at a global level.  For
current users, be aware the interface may change (simplify!) in
release 2.5.0.

Remove and rewrite all the parts of the core/libraries using TIMER1

structure.  Tone, analogWrite(), Servo all now just call into this
shared resource to perform their tasks so are all compatible
and can be used simultaneously.

This setup enables multiple tones, analogWrites, servos, and stepper
motors to be controlled with reasonable accuracy.  It uses both TIMER1
and the internal ESP cycle counter to handle timing of waveform edges.
TIMER1 is used in non-reload mode and only edges cause interrupts.  The
interrupt is started and stopped as required, minimizing overhead when
these features are not being used.

A generic ""startWaveform(pin, high-US, low-US, runtime-US)"" and
""stopWaveform(pin)"" allow for further types of interfaces.  Minimum
high or low period is ~1 us.

BearSSL (https://www.bearssl.org) is a TLS(SSL) library written by
Thomas Pornin that is optimized for lower-memory embedded systems
like the ESP8266. It supports a wide variety of modern ciphers and
is unique in that it doesn't perform any memory allocations during
operation (which is the unfortunate bane of the current axTLS).

BearSSL is also absolutely focused on security and by default performs
all its security checks on x.509 certificates during the connection
phase (but if you want to be insecure and dangerous, that's possible
too).

While it does support unidirectional SSL buffers, like axTLS,
as implemented the ESP8266 wrappers only support bidirectional
buffers. These bidirectional buffers avoid deadlocks in protocols
which don't have well separated receive and transmit periods.

This patch adds several classes which allow connecting to TLS servers
using this library in almost the same way as axTLS:
BearSSL::WiFiClientSecure - WiFiClient that supports TLS
BearSSL::WiFiServerSecure - WiFiServer supporting TLS and client certs

It also introduces objects for PEM/DER encoded keys and certificates:
BearSSLX509List - x.509 Certificate (list) for general use
BearSSLPrivateKey - RSA or EC private key
BearSSLPublicKey - RSA or EC public key (i.e. from a public website)

Finally, it adds a Certificate Authority store object which lets
BearSSL access a set of trusted CA certificates on SPIFFS to allow it
to verify the identity of any remote site on the Internet, without
requiring RAM except for the single matching certificate.
CertStoreSPIFFSBearSSL - Certificate store utility

Client certificates are supported for the BearSSL::WiFiClientSecure, and
what's more the BearSSL::WiFiServerSecure can also *require* remote clients
to have a trusted certificate signed by a specific CA (or yourself with
self-signing CAs).

Maximum Fragment Length Negotiation probing and usage are supported, but
be aware that most sites on the Internet don't support it yet.  When
available, you can reduce the memory footprint of the SSL client or server
dramatically (i.e. down to 2-8KB vs. the ~22KB required for a full 16K
receive fragment and 512b send fragment).  You can also manually set a
smaller fragment size and guarantee at your protocol level all data will
fit within it.

Examples are included to show the usage of these new features.

axTLS has been moved to its own namespace, ""axtls"".  A default ""using""
clause allows existing apps to run using axTLS without any changes.

The BearSSL::WiFi{client,server}Secure implements the axTLS
client/server API which lets many end user applications take advantage
of BearSSL with few or no changes.

The BearSSL static library used presently is stored at
https://github.com/earlephilhower/bearssl-esp8266 and can be built
using the standard ESP8266 toolchain."

* I2S driver fixes for IRQs, protocol, factoring

All redundant ICACHE_FLASH_ATTR decorators were removed, we already do

The actual ISR and its called function moved to to IRAM.  Used to be in flash
due to the decorator, which could lead to crashes.  Use ets_memset to mute
buffers in ISR.

Fix the I2S on-the-wire protocol by enabling the transmit delay I2STMS because
I2S is supposed to send the MSB one clock after LRCLK toggles.  This was
causing I2S to be twice as loud as intended in the best of cases, and causing
garbage/noise output when the MSB was set since data was effectively shifted.

Refactor the clock divider setting to be done in one function only, as there
is no reason to do the same complicated bit setting in two spots.

Comment the known and unknown I2S register settings for posterity, using
the ESP32 guide as a basis.

waiting in blocking writes to ensure we don't hog the CPU completely.

Move all exception strings to IRAM and out of both PMEM (illegal) and add
output of any assert() failinf conditions.

The exception handler may be called while the SPI interface is in a bad
state.  This means no PROGMEM reads are allowed, and all data and functions
used must be in system RAM or IRAM.

Add a new helper macro, ets_printf_P(), which places a constant string in
IRAM and copies it to the stack before calling the real ets_printf().
This makes the code simpler to read as no unwieldy combinations of
ets_putc/ets_printf/... are required to output anything.

The old handler also mistakenly used PSTR() strings in some places, so
fix those with this patch as well.

Gives back ~180 bytes of heap to every sketch built as the exception handler
is always included an application."

At runtime, whenever a realloc, malloc, calloc, or new call fails to
find enough memory, record the calling function and size requested.
Does not print anything or call any heavyweight functions on this, as it
is legal to return NULL to an alloc-type call.

If the main application handles this NULL properly, there should be no
panic and nothing different will happen.

If the main application panics() at any later point in time, this record
will be printed out as part of the crash log for processing with an
updated EspExceptionDecoder.java.

This adds 2-3 instructions overhead in the normal case, and around 10-12
instructions in the failing case, and requires an additional 8 bytes of
.BSS to function.

Only a single address is kept, the final failing malloc-type function call
before a panic, but it is trivial to extend to a fifo with little overhead
in the common, non-failing case."

The default Print::write(byte, count) method was continuing to send
bytes one-by-one even when a prior write returned 0.  Because the buffer
pointer was incremented no matter success or fail, this leads to data
corruption as you'll not send some bytes in the middle and will then
send extra bytes past the end of the passed in buffer.

Because there's no concept of timeout, just stop on the first time
write(byte) fails and return the total bytes successfully written
and let the user worry about retrying or handling an error.

Reported in https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/4078.

WiFiClient::stopAll, called from a WiFi disconnected event handler,
could be called while WiFiClient::connect was in progress. This issue
was initially fixed in #4194, by testing `this` pointer for being
non-null in ClientContext::connect.

This change delegates deletion of ClientContext to WiFiClient
destructor. WiFiClient::stop only calls ClientContext::stop, which
closes/aborts the connection."

* Fix leak on multiple SSL server connections

Fixes #4302

The refcnt setup for the WiFiClientSecure's SSLContext and ClientContext
had issues in certain conditions, causing a massive memory leak on each
SSL server connection.  Depending on the state of the machine, after two or
three connections it would OOM and crash.

This patch replaces most of the refcnt operations with C++11 shared_ptr
operations, cleaning up the code substantially and removing the leakage.

Also fixes a race condition where ClientContext was free'd before the SSLContext
was stopped/shutdown.  When the SSLContext tried to do ssl_free, axtls would
attempt to send out the real SSL disconnect bits over the wire, however by
this time the ClientContext is invalid and it would fault.

* Separate client and server SSL_CTX, support both

Refactor to use a separate client SSL_CTX and server SSL_CTX.  This
allows for separate certificates to be installed on each, and means
that you can now have both a *single* client and a *single* server
running in parallel at the same time, as they'll have separate memory
areas.

Tested using mqtt_esp8266 SSL client with a client certificate and a
WebServerSecure with its own custom certificate and key in parallel.

* Add brackets around a couple if-else clauses"

Previously, _write_some function would be called each time TCP stack
notifies the application that some data was delivered (via the `sent`
callback). In turn, _write_some would obtain more data to be sent from
the DataSource. In case of a DataSource backed by a Stream, this would
read from a stream. Some libraries (such as SD) may call `yield` and
other blocking operations from Stream read function, which can not be
used in TCP stack callbacks.

This change moves the data sending loop back into the Arduino task, with
a negligible loss of performance. TCP callback now wakes the main task
via `esp_schedule`, which performs stream read and provides more data
to the TCP stack.

Possible future optimization would be to buffer Stream data ahead of
time. That way, buffered data could be sent immediately from the TCP
callback. On the other hand, this optimization would need extra TCP_MSS
of temporary storage, per connection.

Fixes #2399."

This is a simple implementation of an LLMNR responder for the ESP8266
Arduino package. Only support for advertizing a single hostname is
currently implemented.

LLMNR is a very similar protocol to MDNS. The primary practical
difference is that Windows systems (at least Windows 7 and later;
perhaps earlier) support the protocol out-of-the-box, whereas additional
software is required to support MDNS. However, Linux support is
currently more complex, and MacOS X support appears non-existent."

* Prevent divide by zero error causing code to crash

As per the issue at #2491, there is a divide by error issue resulting from the specification of 0 as the frequency. This does not appear to affect the AVR implementation, but it crashes on ESP8266s. I have merely removed the division if the frequency is zero, which appears to be giving the expected results (no tone), without any code crashes. 

To test, simply load the toneMelody sketch included with the Arduino IDE (Examples -> 02. Digital -> toneMelody) and change the piezo to something else if you need to. On the Witty module used to test this, I could also tell by the wifi led blinking every time the code crashed as the ESP8266 immediately rebooted.

* Use noTone when frequency is zero

When a frequency of zero is given to tone(), instead call noTone() and exit. Placed after some of the initialisation stuff to ensure the pin is mapped as a output, etc. Tested as functional against a Node MCU 1.0 board and the toneMelody example sketch, using GPIO5 (pin D1).

Bind the UDP connection to IP_ADDR_ANY rather than a specific interface
IP, so that it can receive queries from all interfaces at once.

When processing a query, detect which interface it was received on, and
pass this information to the reply code. Set the IP multicast interface
before each transmission, so that we can route each packet to a
different interface if required. These changes enable the code to
respond correctly on both AP and STA interfaces at once. The original
code only worked correctly for the STA interface if both were enabled.

When advertizing all services, do it on both AP and STA interfaces if
they're both enabled.

Provide an API for the application to notify the MDNS code if the AP
configuration changes (enabled, disabled, IP changed). Ideally, the WiFi
core would provide an event callback for this purpose, as it does for
STA changes, but it does not appear to, so the application must provide
this information."

Hi, 
I added ESP.getFlashChipRealSize() function to the documentation. I couldn't determine flash size of my ESP based on getFlashChipSize function, so I was googling and found this: https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/785
I tested functionality and now adding here to official documentation.
Cheers!"

I2C slave might stil have something to send when ESP826 starts I2C, thus
keeping the bus stuck.
Happens e.g. when power failure/reset during transmission.
Thanks to work of drmpf there is a solution.
Implemented as separate method so as not to interfere with existing.
Usage:

Wire.begin();
if (Wire.status() != I2C_OK) Serial.writeln(""Something wrong with I2C
bus that cannot be recovered. Perform power cycle or search for other
masters on bus."";"

Print::printf would allocate 1460 bytes on the stack, which in some cases would overflow the stack. Additionally it didn't handle (rare) cases when vsnprintf needed a buffer longer than 1460 bytes. This change makes default stack-allocated buffer 64 bytes long, and checks the result returned by vsnprintf. If a buffer longer than 64 bytes is needed, it is allocated on the heap."

Calling String::reserve() causes a crash if String object was in invalidated state. Per the comment on the method's declaration in ESP_SSD1306.h, This method was supposed to recover invalidated strings. This change fixes the edge case bug in String::changeBuffer() which is the root cause of the crash exposed from String::reserve().

Following test code was used to reproduce the problem and also to validate the fix:

String result;
while(true){
  char c = 'A';
  result += c; // the loop will cause malloc() to fail at some point.
  if (result.c_str()==0)
  {
    Serial.println(""String INVALIDATED!!!!!"");
    result.reserve(0);   // before fix, this would crash.
    Serial.println(""Trying to empty...."");
    result=""""; 
    Serial.println(""Emptied!!!!"");
    break;

esp_iot_sdk_v1.5.1_16_01_08 Release Note
----------------------------------------
Resolved Issues (Bugs listed below apply to Bug Bounty Program):
1.espconn_abort may cause system crash.

Optimization:
1.Optimize the data receiving process under TCP connection.
2.Optimize low MAC and increase stability of the software.
3.Optimize watchdog feeding process.
4.Optimize softAP working mode so that some stations can be easily connected.
5.Optimize station working mode, enabling connection even when the SSID of the AP has changed.
6.Optimize station working mode, and increase router’s compatibility during the connection process.
7.Optimize SSL shakehand.
8.Optimize espconn internal timer.
9.Optimize UDP transmission.
10.Improve the flash writing process.
11.Strenthen WPA2 security protocols.
12.Improve data sending ability.
13.Straighten the control capability of GPIO16 under light sleep mode.
14.boot.bin is upgrade to version 1.5, resolving boot failure when firmware is upgraded over the air (OTA).

AT release note：
1.Optimize the process of establishing TCP server via AT command.
2.Optimize UART-WiFi transparent transmission mode via AT command.

Please be noted that with the release of NONOS SDK Version 1.5.0 (ESP8266_NONOS_SDK_V1.5.0), the space that AT commands occupies has increased to more than 4Mbit. Therefore, flash with 512Kbit capacity is no longer supported. Please choose flash with at least 8Mbit capacity.

Please be noted that firmware upgrade over-the-air process is changed a bit. We will upgrade the latest firmware to Espressif Cloud server only after it has been tested and the overall performance is guaranteed. Users may not be able to download firmware encapsulated in ESP8266_NONOS_SDK_V1.5.0 and other more advanced versions."

Tracking _written was required on AVR devices to work around a hardware
limitation when implementing flush().  The ESP8266 doesn't have the same
issue, so we can remove the tracking and make write() more lightweight.

The cost is a minor increase in work done in flush() when write() was not
previously called, but this should be much rarer than individual character
writes."

Prior to this change, the interrupt could fire during initialisation,

_tx_buffer or _rx_buffer each time an interrupt occurred.

By keeping uart_t's and HardwareSerial's (txEnabled, _tx_buffer) and
(rxEnabled, _rx_buffer) in sync, we can remove this extra check, as
well as fixing a null pointer dereference if e.g. _tx_buffer allocation

""init_data"", when non-NULL, is on the heap, and the register_chipv6_phy call
sometimes modifies data in (at least) the offset range [128:249], suggesting
that it is a buffer larger than 128 bytes in size (the size of our
""phy_init_data"" buffer).  When we use our static buffer (prior to this
change), the call could would overwrite the .rodata section and lead to
undefined behaviour.

To address this, just patch the heap-allocated buffer with our data.

Move phy_init_data to flash as it's now readonly and never modified."

This avoids a race where the interrupt handler detects an empty _tx_buffer
just before we write data into it.

Note that commit d6f62943d4b511e7d5fe6147096c8979890416f5 works around
this race when data is continually added to _tx_buffer in the hung state.
We revert that change here as the race should no longer occur.

Testing performed:
 - set UART_CONF1.txfifo_empty_thrhd=0x70 (which exacerbates the issue)
 - generate a ~240 byte burst of data, sent in back-to-back Serial1.write(, 4)
   calls, optionally followed by a Serial1.flush()
Test results:
 - before this change, observe occasional unsent data and hang in flush()
   (if used).
 - after this change, data is sent as expected."

I rewrote digitalWrite because the existing version was breaking
functionality as compared to how it behaves on the AVR,. specifically, I
could not use digitalWrite for a library that works fine on the AVR.

Instead I had to resort to fiddling with GPOC and GPOS and bit masks,
but this rewrite made all of that unnecessary, for whatever reason, it
just works better.

This version borrows a little from the AVR library in the sense that the
same logic is applied to determine whether a pin should be high or low
as the AVR version, and yes, it does appear to make a difference."

When network interface is down, some nasty things happen, for instance tcp_connect returns without ever calling error callback.
This change adds some workarounds for that: before doing a tcp connect and DNS resolve we check if there is a route available.
Also added a listener for wifi events which stops (aborts) all the WiFiClients and WiFiUDPs when wifi is disconnected. This should
help libraries detect disconnect properly."

Place each function or data item into its own section in the output file if the
target supports arbitrary sections. The name of the function or the name of
the data item determines the section’s name in the output file.
Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations to
improve locality of reference in the instruction space. Most systems using the
ELF object format and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have linkers with
such optimizations. AIX may have these optimizations in the future.
Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing so. When
you specify these options, the assembler and linker will create larger object and
executable files and will also be slower. You will not be able to use gprof on all
systems if you specify this option and you may have problems with debugging

* master: (414 commits)
  Don't export sketch if the underlying core does not support it. Fixes #3171
  RSyntaxTextArea: using a modified version, tracked at https://github.com/arduino/RSyntaxTextArea. Fixes #3099
  Updated keywords.txt
  New editor on MacOSX: since CMD+J is known as ""jump to selection"" and the editor has no such feature, CMD+J is disabled on mac. See #3098
  Old Preferences class remains for backwards compatibility as a delegate for PreferencesData
  New Preferences window: renders fine on every OS and it's easier to adapt using NetBeans as visual editor. Fixes #3140
  Remove spawn from exec command
  Removed redundant call to File.deleteIfExists()
  Removed buggy redundant check in FileUtils.deleteIfExists()
  Restored current line/current selected lines display on lower left of the IDE. Fixes #3134
  Updated cursor.ino
  New editor on MacOSX: restored CMD+E for finding selected text
  New editor on MacOSX: CMD+UP/DOWN moves cursor to start or end of sketch. See #3098
  New editor on MacOSX: CMD+BACKSPACE deletes current line until cursor position, ALT+BACKSPACE deletes previous word. See #3098
  ArduinoIDE is in the default package. Removed
  Fixes  #2969:
  Fix Uncategorized warning message
  New editor: ALT+ BACKSPACE deletes next word (OSX only). See #3098
  New editor: ALT+ UP/DOWN move current line only if ""editor.advanced"" (hidden pref) is true. Fixes #3101
  New editor: mark occurrences enable when ""editor.advanced"" (hidden pref) is true. Fixes #3102

Maybe even implement uploads over WiFi."
