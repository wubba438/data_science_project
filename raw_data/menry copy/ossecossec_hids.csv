From @mobstef in issue #1570:
""The FreeBSD build servers create binary packages from ports as non-root user. It is therefore essential, that the Makefile allows installation as non-root user too. The problem with current Makefile is that it explicitly references ""root"" user and ""0"" group. Additionally it sets permission on certain directories to 550 and later writes to them, which is possible by root, but not as an unprivileged user. The best solution I came up with is to replace every invocation of ""install"" command by a macro, that by default sets mode and ownership of files as it used to be (""INSTALL_CMD""). If anybody needs to skip permission and ownership setting, he just need to set ""INSTALL_CMD=install""."""

Added note regarding to following cis note: In Microsoft's own hardening guidance, they recommend the opposite value, Enabled, because having this data logged improves investigations of PowerShell attack incidents. However, the default ACL on the PowerShell Operational log allows Interactive User (i.e. any logged on user) to read it, and therefore possibly expose passwords or other sensitive information to unauthorized users. If Microsoft locks down the default ACL on that log in the future (e.g. to restrict it only to Administrators), then we will revisit this recommendation in a future release."

  When writing rule id in json alerts file, the id is truncated and can be non unique, on intensive alerts generation.
  This is due snprintf buffer size which is too small to store id. Indeed id is composed of two long int (timestamp and log offset) then the size can be to 21 characters (10 digits for both timestamp and offset + the dot)
  The fix set id buffer to the correct size, and snprintf max size.

I have encountered a significant issue in OSSEC 2.9.3 and the current OSSEC beta (GitHub repository) release that affects the ability of OSSEC clients to be able to connect to FreeBSD servers. This issue also probably affects all current BSD derivatives and possibly some Linux systems as well. I have identified and resolved the issue in OSSEC by rewriting some of the networking code, however, before I describe the solution, I wanted to provide some background information on the problem first.

Problem Symptoms

The server is running FreeBSD 11.1 with all of the current updates. This is a standard OSSEC server installation with all standard options enabled and no bells and whistles (no MySQL and no MQ). After correcting for some BSD-specific issues for header files and libraries, OSSEC installs normally on the server with the install.sh script and the compilation completes without any fatal errors (GCC does generate a few warnings on analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c and analysisd/decoders/syscheck-test.c, but these are not show stoppers). The server has an assigned IP address of 192.168.1.80 (IPv4 private IP space) and all of the clients it associates with are on the local 192.168.1.0/24 network.

The OSSEC 2.9.3 client software is installed on each Windows workstation and valid client keys are obtained for each client system. Everything appears fine, except that there are no alerts logged on the server for any of the configured clients. In short, the problem manifests itself as an inability for the client systems to connect to the OSSEC server. In the ossec.log file on each client there are messages like this that repeat over and over:

2018/03/08 12:11:06 ossec-agentd: INFO: Trying to connect to server 192.168.1.80, port 1514. 2018/03/08 12:11:06 INFO: Connected to 192.168.1.80 at address 192.168.1.80:1514, port 1514 2018/03/08 12:11:27 ossec-agentd(4101): WARN: Waiting for server reply (not started). Tried: '192.168.1.80'.

2018/03/08 12:12:41 ossec-agentd: INFO: Trying to connect to server 192.168.1.80, port 1514. 2018/03/08 12:12:41 INFO: Connected to 192.168.1.80 at address 192.168.1.80:1514, port 1514 2018/03/08 12:13:02 ossec-agentd(4101): WARN: Waiting for server reply (not started). Tried: '192.168.1.80'.

Because the clients use UDP, and UDP is a connectionless protocol, there is no protocol handshake to ensure a connection has actually been established like there would be with TCP. As long as the sendto() function returns a positive integer (the number of bytes sent), the call is deemed successful. This is true even when packets are not received on the destination host. To compensate for this, the server is supposed to return a control message to indicate the packet was received. Because the client never receives this confirmation, a warning is generated in the client log ""Waiting for server reply (not started)"".

On the server, remoted starts fine. It displays the maximum number of agents allowed (2048) and logs the fact that it successfully read the authentication keys file. However, the server logs hint that there is an issue when remoted starts because each client in the client.keys file results in a message stating ""Assigning counter for agent Workstation01: '0:0'"", or ""Assigning sender counter: 0:0"". These messages are generated when a client is defined in the etc/client.keys file, but no initial connection has ever occurred. This is normal for a first time start of OSSEC, but if this happens every time you restart OSSEC for every client defined in the system, your clients are not communicating.

To identify whether remoted was listening on UDP port 1514, I used the ""netstat -an"" command and the FreeBSD ""sockstat"" command (sockstat is like ""lsof"" for sockets). The only address bound to port 1514 was an IPv6 address, not the IPv4 address. The server uses only a single IPv4 address for network communication, and no IPv6 addresses. However, it turns out that FreeBSD (and many other systems) create a link-local IPv6 address based on the MAC address of each interface when IPv6 is not specifically configured for the interface. This is specified in RFC 2462.

The standard solution for this would be to specify an IP address for the ""secure"" connection in the remote configuration using the <local_ip> option. However, when that is used, OSSEC ignores it and the system continues to bind to the IPv6 link-local address. While I could have experimented with disabling IPv6 in the operating system, this could have an adverse impact on other applications running on the server.

Normally, the system should simply query all available addresses on the system using getaddrinfo(), create a socket for each address, and bind the address to the socket. If the protocol is TCP, then you also need to use listen() to establish  a queue. Then select() can be used to handle the dispatch of the individual sockets as messages arrive. I have a lot of experience with writing network interfaces in C, so I decided I would take a look at what was going on inside OSSEC that was creating this issue for me.

Initial Analysis

The OSSEC remoted process is responsible for handling the connections between the clients and the server. All of this code, except for the actual networking code, is found in the src/remoted directory. The initial connections for the UDP secure server and the syslog server are initiated in the HandleRemote() function inside remoted.c through calls to OS_Bindportudp() or OS_Bindporttcp() which are found in os_net/os_net.c. What is immediately obvious is that only one socket is returned as an integer value, instead of a group of sockets (one for each interface and protocol family).

The actual processing of incoming messages is divided between secure.c for secure UDP connections, syslog.c for syslog UDP connections, and syslogtcp.c for syslog TCP connections. Most of the outgoing connections are handled by send_msg.c (with some exceptions). Because there is only one socket used per communication strategy (secure UDP, syslog UDP, and syslog TCP), all of the routines use a while(1) loop with blocking reads to process incoming messages. To handle multiple sockets without dragging the CPU into the mud, these would have to be modified to use select().

The next thing I looked at was the code that was doing the network calls, which is found in the file os_net/os_net.c.  Both the OS_Bindportudp() and OS_Bindporttcp() calls referred to a function called OS_Bindport() to handle all of the network initialization code including querying the available addresses, creating the socket, binding the address, invoking listen() for the queue (TCP only), and returning the active socket to the caller.

The code in os_net/os_net.c clearly showed my dilemma; the call to getaddrinfo() was setup to use AF_INET6 for the address family and AI_V4MAPPED, AI_PASSIVE, and AI_ADDRCONFIG for flags. Under this specification, IPv6 is preferred over IPv4, and if no IPv6 addresses exist and IPv4 addresses do exist, the IPv4 address is to be returned as a mapped IPv4 address using IPv6. A better solution is to use PF_UNSPEC for the address family with AI_PASSIVE and AI_ADDRCONFIG to pick up all addressed on configured interfaces.

The original author of this module recognized this as a problem early on, but s/he assumed that if they had AI_V4MAPPED defined in netdb.h, then the system would handle it properly. However, if IPv4 is preferred and there are any IPv6 addresses configured on the system, AI_V4MAPPED will not yield any IPv4 addresses. There is a good article by IBM on this that you can read here:

https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.hale001/ipv6d0131000748.htm

This is further compounded because OSSEC is returning only a single socket bound to a single address making the process of supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time is impossible. The only correct solution is to modify OSSEC to handle multiple IP addresses under both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.

The Solution

The overall solution to this problem was to return all of the addresses that meet the selection criteria and use the select() function to return sockets that are ready for reading. While this change affected a number of modules in the OSSEC system, the change was relatively straight forward to implement. A list of modules affected is provided at the end of this document.

Under the current version of OSSEC, a function named OS_Bindport() is used to locate the first address that is returned from getaddrinfo(). Then a socket for the appropriate connection type is created (SOCK_DGRAM for UDP or SOCK_STREAM for TCP), and the address is bound to the socket. If the connection is a TCP connection, a queue is established for the bound socket using listen(). Then the integer value socket is returned. If the socket value is -1, an error is assumed and various error actions are taken by the caller.

Under the modified version, OS_Bindport() was modified in a number of ways. First, instead of returning an integer value representing a bound socket to the caller, the routine now returns a pointer to an OSNetInfo structure. The OSNetInfo structure is defined in os_net/os_net.h as follows:

typedef struct _OSNetInfo {
  fd_set fdset;                         /* set of sockets used by select ()*/
  int fdmax;                            /* fd max socket for select() */
  int fds[FD_SETSIZE];                  /* array of bound sockets for send() */
  int fdcnt;                            /* number of sockets in array */
  int status;                           /* return status (-1 is error) */
  int retval;                           /* return value (additional info) */
} OSNetInfo;

In order to multiplex multiple sockets efficiently, we need to use the select() function. The select() function operates on a struct called fd_set that is built on the successful acquisition of a socket with a bound address. Each successful acquisition is added to the set using the FD_SET macro. We also track the highest value socket number returned in fdmax. When all processing is completed, fdmax is incremented by 1 so it can be used directly with the select() function in other modules. We also track the individual bound sockets in an integer table called fds, and a count of the number of sockets in the table using fdcnt.

Because the original implementation relied upon a return value of -1 to indicate an error, we include an element in the struct called status that performs the same function. If status is -1, then an error has occurred. Upon a successful return, the status element will be 0. If status is -1, the return value element retval will contain the error number associated with the error status. The OSNetInfo struct made the process of modifying the OSSEC networking code relatively simple because it preserved all of the functionality that was inherent with the original code.

In addition to the OSNetInfo structure as a return value, the second major change to os_net/os_net.c was the definition of hints to the getaddrinfo() function. The getaddrinfo() function was created by the POSIX standards committee to provide support both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously. The getaddrinfo() function modifies a struct that returns a pointer to a linked list of addresses that match the selection criteria passed to getaddrinfo() through the hints parameter struct.

Under the original OSSEC code, if the operating system platform had AI_V4MAPPED defined in <netdb.h> (the vast majority of modern OS's support this), then the hints structure passed to getaddrinfo() used AF_INET6 for the protocol family. This essentially guaranteed that only IPv6 addresses would be returned if they were defined on the system. Even if there are no IPv6 addresses configured on the system, the AF_INET6 protocol family with the AI_V4MAPPED flag will return a mapped IPv4 address in IPv6 format.

For current *BSD systems, if an IPv6 address is not defined on an interface, the system will create a link-local IPv6 address based on the MAC address of each interface. IPv6 link-local addresses are essentially useless for external communication, so the net result is that *BSD systems (and others) are not able to communicate using IPv4.

By modifying this to use AF_UNSPEC instead of AF_INET6, eliminating the AI_V4MAPPED flag, and utilizing all of the addresses returned by the call to getaddrinfo(), we have the ability to communicate through all of the interfaces defined on the system using both IPv4 nd IPv6. Nonetheless, there are a number of Linux systems that are working fine for OSSEC with the AF_INET6 family and the AI_V4MAPPED flag. As such, an ""#if defined"" definition was placed in the code to support the original behavior on Linux systems, with the PF_UNSPEC behavior defined for non-Linux systems. In the event you do want to use the PF_UNSPEC code with a Linux system (I suspect this will become the norm as more versions of Linux adopt RFC 2462 and the link-local address), all you need to do is to uncomment the line in the Makefile that defines NOV4MAP and the system will use AF_UNSPEC instead of AF_INET6.

Once the call is made to getaddrinfo(), we utilize a loop to process each of the addresses returned in the linked list of addresses. Each socket that is bound successfully is added to the fd_set for subsequent select() processing, and also added to an array of integers containing bound sockets. The only other substantive change that was made to this module is that we set a socket option for the SO_REUSEADDR flag. In the event OSSEC is stopped and restarted again, the use of the SO_REUSEADDR socket option allows OSSEC to restart immediately without having to wait for a lingering socket to close. It also improves performance for short duration transactions.

The other changes in the os_net/os_net.c module include changing the return parameter from integer to a pointer to an OSNetInfo struct for OS_Bindportudp() and OS_Bindporttcp(), and a number of helper functions were added to the bottom of the module to provide additional information as the addresses are retrieved, sockets created, and addresses are bound to sockets.

Once the changes were made to os_net/os_net.c, the remoted struct in config/remote-config.h  was modified to add a pointer called netinfo to the remoted struct using a typedef of OSNetInfo (directly below where the sock element is defined), and remoted/remoted.c was modified to accept the new OSNetInfo pointer and store it in the netinfo element in the logr configuration struct.

Next, I modified the routines that use the sockets to use the logr.netinfo element instead of the logr.sock element that was originally used for reads. Blocking reads were replaced with select() to multiplex the sockets that became available for reading. This change affected secure.c, syslog.c, and syslogtcp.c in the remoted subdirectory, and main-server.c in the os_auth subdirectory.

The remoted/sendmsg.c module was modified to use multiple sockets for sending. In the event a message was received on one of the sockets, that socket was used for sending the packet out. In the event no packet had been received, the routine was modified to loop through the list of available sockets to ensure the packet is sent.

The Makefile was also modified to added a define for NOV4MAP, which is commented out by default. When this is defined, Linux systems can build remoted with AF_UNSPEC instead of AF_INET6 and the AI_V4MAPPED attribute that was described earlier. As more operating systems adopt the link-local specification to establish an IPv6 address based on the MAC address, this could help Linux users with being able to support IPv4 on their systems.

There are two other changes I made that are not related to the IP address issue but relate to successfully compiling and installing OSSEC on FreeBSD.  Because I had to modify the Makefile for the NOV4MAP define, it made sense to include these changes as part of this pull request. Both of these changes are to make files that are provided with the distribution.

The first change is to the Makefile in the top src directory. BSD systems use the /usr/local directory for managing files and programs that are not part of the standard operating system distribution. MySQL, Postgres, MQ, readline, and other applications are extensions that get installed under /usr/local. As such, it is necessary to add /usr/local/include directory for C header files and /usr/local/lib for object libraries. This already existed in Makefile for OpenBSD, but not for FreeBSD or NetBSD.

The second Makefile change I made was to the LUA Makefile for BSD distributions. Like the Makefile in the src directory described above, the LUA build needs to have the same definitions for header files and libraries. The file I modified under the src directory is external/lua/src/Makefile. The modification added parameters for -I/usr/local/include and -L/usr/local/lib. With these changes, FreeBSD and other BSD systems will compile without problems using gmake and gcc.

Header Files Modified

os_net/os_net.h - Defined a new typedef struct called OSNetInfo that is used to return a list of bound sockets back to the caller, and changed the return values defined for OS_Bindporttcp() and OS_Bindportudp() to use a pointer to the OSNetInfo struct instead of the integer value they used to return. The pointer to the OSNetInfo struct is stored in the remoted struct that is defined as ""logr"" in the code. The pointer to the OSNetInfo pointer is named netinfo.

config/remote-config.h - Added a #include for ""os_net/os_net.h"" to ensure the appropriate network function headers were defined for select() and added a pointer to an OSNetInfo struct named netinfo to the remoted struct. The netinfo pointer serves the same purpose as the old sock element, except that it handles multiple sockets instead of just a single socket. The remoted struct, which is usually referred to as logr in the remoted code, is used to pass a number of configuration elements between the remoted modules.

Source Modules Modified

os_net/os_net.c - Modified the module to return a struct called OSNetInfo that contains the bound sockets for each of the addresses in a format ready for use by select(), and an array of sockets that can be referenced for individual socket usage. The OSNetInfo struct is described earlier in this document. Also added code to use PF_UNSPEC for all interfaces except those that are for Linux and also have AI_V4MAPPED defined in <netdb.h>. Also added a number of helper functions to display addresses and other status information in the ossec.log file using verbose().

remoted/remoted.c - Modified the module to use the new OSNetInfo struct for return values from calls to OS_Bindporttcp() and OS_Bindportudp().

remoted/secure.c - Modified secure.c to utilize OSNetInfo data with multiple bound sockets via logr.netinfo instead of the original single bound socket with logr.sock. Also changed the message receipt loop to use select() to multiplex the sockets, instead of blocking on a read for a single socket.

remoted/syslog.c - Modified syslog.c to support UDP messages the same way we modified secure.c, including using the OSNetInfo struct for multiple sockets and the select() call to support multiplexing.

remoted/syslogtcp.c - Modified syslogtcp.c to support TCP messages the same way we modified secure.c and syslog.c, including using the OSNetInfo struct for multiple sockets and the select() call to support multiplexing.

remoted/sendmsg.c - Modified sendmsg.c to use the bound socket array in the netinfo structure. If we have previously identified a valid socket, we use that socket to send on. Otherwise, we cycle through the array of valid bound sockets until we get a successful completion on the sendto() call. This approach appears to work well.

os_auth/main-server.c - This module was an outlier, but because it called OS_Bindporttcp() it had to be modified to support the new multi-address approach. Modified main-server.c to use new OSNetInfo struct for data returned by OS_Bindporttcp and implemented the select() call to multiplex the group of sockets.

Makefile Modifications

Makefile - Found in the src directory at the top of the directory tree, I added /usr/local/include to CFLAGS and /usr/local/lib OSSEC_LDFLAGS to support successful compilation on FreeBSD and NetBSD. Also added the define for NOV4MAP that is commented out. When NOV4MAP is defined, Linux distributions will use AF_UNSPEC to bind sockets instead of AF_INET6 with the AI_V4MAPPED flag.

external/lua/src/Makefile - LUA compilation fails with the current Makefile because the /usr/local/include directory is not specified for headers, and the /usr/local/lib is not specified for object libraries. I added parameters to the definitions for bsd and freebsd in the Makefile to make sure those directories were included. This allows the LUA compile process to complete without errors.

Modification Summary and Pull Request

I had originally performed this modification for the OSSEC 2.9.3 release and tested it thoroughly on FreeBSD 11.1 for several weeks. I then ported these changes into the current code branch of OSSEC that I retrieved from GitHub on May 1, 2018. This required my changes to be re-ported into newer versions of os_auth/main-server.c, os_net/os_net.c, and os_net/os_net.h. I also had to re-port changes into the two Makefiles I identified earlier. I only have a day of use on this, but it seemd to be running ithout issues.

If anyone is interested in the changes that work for the 2.9.3 release, you can download the modified OSSEC 2.9.3 release from https://networkalarmcorp.com/dnld/ossec-hids-2.9.3.1.tgz. I should have the 2.9.3 code up on my server by Thursday.

I have submitted a pull request for this modification to be incorporated into the OSSEC code base. If anyone has any questions or suggestions related to this modification, I am happy to discuss them. I hope this modification helps the OSSEC community at large.

The previous method (using ctime) has a number of issues that make it a bit weird to integrate with popular logging tools like ELK:

1. It appends a \n at the end of the timestamp which messes up date formatting for the unwary
2. It outputs time in the local timezone, without actually outputting the timezone... so logging tools like ELK will assume the date is in UTC, when actually it's GMT+2 or whatever... causing silly things like display logs in the future 

Easier method would be as proposed - simply output the timestamp in UNIX/EPOCH format. In this case it's millisecond epoch format - this is far more unambiguous for log parsers"

This PR fixes the following Windows-related build issues:

S_ISLNK usage
S_ISLNK isn't a supported call on Windows due to the lack of filesystem links like they exist on Unix-based systems. Other parts of the code properly check if WIN32 is defined, however, one piece was overlooked. This is fixed in one of the commits in this PR.

MINGW_HAS_SECURE_API Incorrectly Used
The MINGW_HAS_SECURE_API was used incorrectly and broke the Windows build - the correct usage is to define this to '1' instead of just defining it, as evident in the mingw headers.

Add Windows-specific output to .gitignore
Some of the build output files aren't added to the .gitignore, causing a potential source tree pollution when committing to the repository. Most notably, there was no exclusion for *.exe and *.dll files, while there was an exclusion for .so files. This discrepancy has been corrected."

OS_IsValidIP violated it's `const` constraint when the ip_addr element
was set to 'any'.  This caused some unexplained behavior when subsequent
calls.  This is corrected.

OS_IPFound and OS_IPFoundList where call sacmp(), but if OS_IsValidIP
was called with ""any"", the sockaddr_store.ss_family would be AF_INET6.
AFAICT, this meant any comparison of ""any"" to an IPv4 address would
fail.  This affected the ossec-remoted when validating IPv4 keys issued
by authd which set 'any' as the IP address to verify.

This would also cause failures *everywhere* in the rules, analysis,
exec, and activeresponse code where the src/dst IP being compared to any

Users have long called for TLS support when sending mail from
OSSEC. This is not trivial to add directly but this commit enables
that support by delegating the task to a sendmail-like executable such
as SSMTP or Msmtp.

maild detects this mode of operation by checking for a / at the start
of the smtp_server setting. It uses popen to launch the executable and
passes the raw message to it via stdin. sendmail's -t argument tells
it to parse the headers given in the message so smtp_server will
typically be set to something like /usr/sbin/sendmail -t.

In order for this to work, maild needs to be started without chrooting
as it traditionally has done. It will therefore no longer chroot if it
detects a / at the start of smtp_server. Privilege separation is still
possible, hence the previous commit.

It is best to view this commit with --ignore-all-space as there are
far few changes than the regular diff would imply."

Affected versions: 2.7 - 2.8.1

Beginning is OSSEC 2.7 (d88cf1c9) a feature was added to syscheck, which
is the daemon that monitors file changes on a system, called
""report_changes"". This feature is only available on *NIX systems. It's
purpose is to help determine what about a file has changed. The logic to
do accomplish this is as follows which can be found in
src/syscheck/seechanges.c:

252 /* Run diff */
253 date_of_change = File_DateofChange(old_location);
254 snprintf(diff_cmd, 2048, ""diff \""%s\"" \""%s\"" > \""%s/local/%s/diff.%d\"" ""
255     ""2>/dev/null"",
256     tmp_location, old_location,
257     DIFF_DIR_PATH, filename + 1, (int)date_of_change);
258 if (system(diff_cmd) != 256) {
259     merror(""%s: ERROR: Unable to run diff for %s"",
260            ARGV0,  filename);
261     return (NULL);
262 }

Above, on line 258, the system() call is used to shell out to the
system's ""diff"" command. The raw filename is passed in as an argument
which presents an attacker with the possibility to run arbitrary code.
Since the syscheck daemon runs as the root user so it can inspect any
file on the system for changes, any code run using this vulnerability
will also be run as the root user.

An example attack might be creating a file called ""foo-$(touch bar)""
which should create another file ""bar"".

Again, this vulnerability exists only on *NIX systems and is contingent
on the following criteria:

1. A vulnerable version is in use.
2. The OSSEC agent is configured to use syscheck to monitor the file
system for changes.
3. The list of directories monitored by syscheck includes those writable
by underprivileged users.
4. The ""report_changes"" option is enabled for any of those directories.

The fix for this is to create temporary trusted file names that symlink
back to the original files before calling system() and running the
system's ""diff"" command."

The slash replacement fixes in 262630f6 were not quite good enough and
there were still issues. Namely, the slash between the directory and the
bookmark name was getting replaced which was causing the files to get
created in the wrong locations.

One of the biggest reasons problems continued to exist was because the
replace_slash() function was based on the original code in beea14c4
which was also faulty. However, because of a slightly different if
statement the issue would never really manifest itself that often.

The new code makes a copy of the name of the event log and stores as a
member of the channel struct that gets passed around. All of the string
manipulations can be applied to it."

Some of the bookmarks can have slashes in the name. For example,
""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"". The slashes can get interpreted
as part of the path when creating both the bookmark and the temporary

There was already some code to replace the last slash in the
eventchannel name with a space when creating the bookmark file name.
This code was turned into a function called replace_slash() and is now
also done when creating the bookmark temporary file names. The
temprorary file names were also changed slightly by adding a trailing
'-' before the random characters are added by mkstemp_ex().

Also, the slash was replaced with a space. A space in file names is sort
of ugly so that was changed to an underscore. It may have some affect
on anyone using eventchannel and future events but hopefully the impact
is negligible."

There was pretty much no error checking in the eventchannel code. Adding
error checking obviously has the benefit of catching and logging errors
but it also helps in readability. It is now a bit easier to understand
what the code is doing and where things can go wrong and why.

A good example of this is many of the Windows system calls are done
twice. The first call is done to determine the buffer size necessary to
hold the data a proper call would produce. This allows for the right
amount of memory to be allocated. This first call actually fails but it
fails in a very predictable manner. Unexpected failures should be
accounted for.

Reworked get_messages() to be get_message() which is less code and a bit
more dynamic in what it can do. There are a number of events (shown
below) someone might want to access and this new function allows for
that pretty easily.

typedef enum _EVT_FORMAT_MESSAGE_FLAGS {
  EvtFormatMessageEvent     = 1,
  EvtFormatMessageLevel     = 2,
  EvtFormatMessageTask      = 3,
  EvtFormatMessageOpcode    = 4,
  EvtFormatMessageKeyword   = 5,
  EvtFormatMessageChannel   = 6,
  EvtFormatMessageProvider  = 7,
  EvtFormatMessageId        = 8,
  EvtFormatMessageXml       = 9
} EVT_FORMAT_MESSAGE_FLAGS;

Changed many of the functions to return errors when they are
encountered. Those errors might not be accounted for because they
frankly don't need to. The data being gathered just won't be displayed
in the final log message. The errors happening inside the functions will
also be logged for review later.

Made a lot of changes to the code format to improve readability. Things
like spacing and changing variable names went a long way. Some things
were a bit inconsistent.

Found that a few variables were not being declared NULL to begin with
which had the potential for errors later. Specifically, the os_event
structure in send_event_channel() seemed to be prone to this.

Created new functions to handle the opening, creating and updating of
the bookmarks. Also, made some improvements in how that is all handled
but there is still a lot that can be done which will come in a future
commit.

With the bookmark code, access() was used which has the common time of
check, time of use pitfalls. This has been removed in favor of just
opening the file and asking forgiveness later.

Finally, the last notable thing to discuss is that wcstombs_s() was not
converting many of the event log messages. This was able to be
successfully reproduced by generating the logs produced when a user
access the system using RDP. It's possible there was an issue with how
wcstombs_s() was being used by switching to WideCharToMultiByte() solved
the issue. Since this code does not need to be cross platform this seems
like the preferable choice when presented with both anyway."

Instead of only pulling out certain events from the event logs with
event channel pull out everything. This is how nxlog does it and they
seems to have a good handle on eventlog and eventchannel. Good designers
copy, great designers steal. Much thanks goes to nxlog and keeping their
source open. It has been a great help. The people over at Zabbix also
seem to have a similar tool that also has good code to look at for
inspiration and examples.

Not sure if there is any benefit to only pulling out certain events
from the event log. Perhaps, there is some performance benefit. Seems
like nxlog finds it acceptable and their software is quite fast so I
doubt it is of major significance.

These changes again bring the output of the eventlog code and the new
eventchannel code closer together."

Work toward fixing issue #224. The event channel output was multiline
which was causing issues for users.

Found that the old event log code was getting subjected to some string
manipulation that was removing newlines and replacing tabs after
argument fields with spaces.

Moved this code to a central location so both the old and new can be
subjected to the same manipulation. Decided to call this function
win_format_event_string().

Despite this change, the output from the two event log gathering methods
still differs slightly. The old event log message seems to go through a
few other things that can change the string liek FormatMessage(), which
is a Windows system call.

During a small amount of testing it did not appear the old event log
gathering ever needed to have newlines removed and tabs replaced. It
appears that either the logs are coming out that way or the formatting
is being done somewhere previously in the code. Perhaps, FormatMessage()
is doing it.

That said, the event channel stuff certainly does get affected by
win_format_event_string() so it more closely matches it's counterpart
albeit not exactly."

Create temporary files in a secure manner on both NIX and Windows
platforms that will be used to write client.keys and ossec.conf data to.
Then use atomic operations where possible to replace the current

On Windows, decided to hardcode the location of COMSPEC instead of
pulling it from an environment variable each time. It is highly unlikely
the location of this will change but may re-examine in the future.

Since temporary files are now a possibility on agent only installs I
updated the Windows installer to inclue a tmp directory. Need to figure
out what is involved with doing the same on the NIX side."

OSSEC 0.5 (released 11/2005) - 2.8

Affected code: All know version

SHA1 checksum:
1d72a8cd347379ef7a533ba9633231c5bfedfa1a ossec-hids-2.8.tar.gz

OSSEC v2.8 provides a utility named ""host-deny.sh"" which may be used to
add and remove IP addresses from the /etc/hosts.deny file. For example,
too many unsuccessful attempts to log into the shell as root via sshd
can trigger an automatic block of the offending IP address if the
""active response"" system is enabled (the default configuration option
has it enabled). The IP address is then automatically removed after the
block has expired (default is 600 seconds). The logic for the removal
can be found in ossec-hids-2.8/active-response/host-deny.sh and is as
follows:

111 # Deleting from hosts.deny
112 elif [ ""x${ACTION}"" = ""xdelete""  ]; then
113 lock;
114 if [ ""X$UNAME"" = ""XFreeBSD""  ]; then
115 cat /etc/hosts.allow | grep -v ""ALL : ${IP} : deny$""> /tmp/hosts.deny.$$
116 mv /tmp/hosts.deny.$$ /etc/hosts.allow
117 else
118 cat /etc/hosts.deny | grep -v ""ALL:${IP}$""> /tmp/hosts.deny.$$
119 cat /tmp/hosts.deny.$$ > /etc/hosts.deny
120 rm /tmp/hosts.deny.$$
121 fi
[???]

As shown above on lines 115 and 118, a predictable filename is written
to the /tmp directory in the format of ""/tmp/hosts.deny."" followed by
the process ID. Then the contents of the file are copied back to the
/etc/hosts.deny file. This presents a race condition that any local
user can perform:

1) create the /tmp/hosts.deny.$$ file first
2) wait for root to overwrite the file
3) write your own data to the file before it is copied to /etc/hosts.deny

Though the window of attack is very small, this attack has been 100%
reliable on a test system by monitoring the file via inotify(7).

In addition to the previous information that was sent, it should be
noted that this vulnerability can result in command execution as the
root user via the ""twist"" option (see hosts_options(5) for more info).

An example from my proof of concept is below.

Now whenever anyone connects to sshd on the host, the command ""id | wall""
will be executed as root."

[???]

As shown above on lines 115 and 118, a predictable filename is written
to the /tmp directory in the format of ""/tmp/hosts.deny."" followed by
the process ID. Then the contents of the file are copied back to the
/etc/hosts.deny file. This presents a race condition that any local
user can perform:

1) create the /tmp/hosts.deny.$$ file first
2) wait for root to overwrite the file
3) write your own data to the file before it is copied to /etc/hosts.deny

Though the window of attack is very small, this attack has been 100%
reliable on a test system by monitoring the file via inotify(7).

In addition to the previous information that was sent, it should be
noted that this vulnerability can result in command execution as the
root user via the ""twist"" option (see hosts_options(5) for more info).

An example from my proof of concept is below.

Now whenever anyone connects to sshd on the host, the command ""id | wall""
will be executed as root."

brought up in #207.

The '-c' option should now work so a user can specify an alternate
configuration location. Also, the '-D' and '-u' options were removed.
This is important to note because previously they would have just been
silently ignored. With this commit, specifying these options will
present the help() output and exit non-zero.

Of course this has the potential to break a setup out there but I would
imagine the likelyhood is low that people are specifying these options."

Fixes #225. The installed date was only ever gathered at compile time
and not each and every time the ossec-installer was run on each system.
This would result in the installed date being the same on all systems
and equal to the time when the installer was compiled.

This makes me wonder if installed date was actually supposed to be
something like 'compiled date'. I'm going to go with it being a bug
though just because of the naming of everything.

This bug has likely existed for quite some time but was only recently
discovered becuase I moved the installed date into the win32ui making it
more visible to end users.

The current time should now be gathered on every run of the installer
and updating VERSION.txt with the information. Also, the issue of the
seconds being cut off should hopefully no longer be an issue as well
since the new method of getting the time shortens the string due to the
difference in the way the time is formatted."

Change notes:

  - Explicitly set WINVER to Windows XP (0x0501) as the minimum

  - Add ws2_32 library (make.bat, make.sh)

  - Define missing addrinfo values and sa_family_t typedef (os_net.h)

  - Remove possibly obsolete ENOBUFS definition and use Windows
    equivalent of inet_ntop (WSAAddressToString) (os_net.c)

  - Use Windows equivalent of inet_pton (WSAStringToAddress)
    (check_open_ports.c)

  - Test for redefinition of ALERT_SYSTEM_ERROR to avoid numerous build

Updated the style of ossec-installer.nsi so it is easier to read.

Turned on Uninstallation details same as is done for installtion
details.

Start to use SimpleSC plugin (Rainer Döpke) to handle the intial
stopping of the OSSEC agent service. The hope is this plugin can later
be used to do handle all of the necessary service configuration that
is required.

Added error checking around many of the (un)installation steps. There
is plenty of room for more error checking but hopefully this covers
some of the major problem areas.

Added logic to create the ossec.log on every installation.

Fixed cleaning up the bookmarks directory.

Start to use nsProcess plugin (Shengalts Aleksander aka Instructor) to
detect if either manage_agents.exe or win32ui.exe are running during
an uninstall. When they are running the uninstallation will fail to
remove those files and thus fails to remove the ossec-agent directory."

added o the email headers as ""X-IDS-OSSEC: $value"" to make sorting of

Added the shebang. Also used 'set -e' to exit the scripts upon

if there is an issue compiling anything for any reason stop there

Previously, it would just continue on until something would look
for the executables that weren't there and exit. Usually after makensis.

This makes it a lot clearer on where things went wrong and you don't have
to trudge through a lot of output to find compile issues."

Accumulator allows the collection of data across multiple log entries by
decoding and grouping on an id field.  The cache for the accumulator
lasts:
    Default expire to 2 minutes (on lookup of exact key)
    Default purge count to 200 lookups (on lookup of any key)
    Default purge interval to 5 minutes (on lookup of any key)

== hash_op.(c|h)
* Change to design of the API, OSHash owns the key's memory, caller owns
  the data elements memory.
* OSHash_Add() strdup's the key
* OSHash_Free() now free()'s the key element
* OSHash_Delete() added so hashes can be dynamic

== accumulator.(c|h)
* This allows log lines to accumulate details based on the previous log
  entries which share the same id element.  Lines must contain, therefor
  the decoder must extract, the id element, or the accumulator simply
  returns without performing any action. It is important to note, this
  is not a multi-line reader, each log line is treated as it's own
  event.  As more data is learned about each ID, the events are able
  to use that data.
* Accumulate_Init() sets up the accumulator constants and initilizations
  variables
* Accumulate() performs the accumulation of event data. The default
  expiry for an event ID is 5 minutes of inactivity.
* Accumulate_CleanUp() is called once every 100 lookups or once every 10
  minutes, whichever happens first.

== etc/decoder.xml
* Enabled accumulator plugin for the OpenLDAP Decoder.  This allows for
  rules to be created with <same_source_ip/>, like with SSHD multiple
  login failures.

Bug fixes included:
 * Accumulator working with in-memory structs
 * Testrule.c now is very flagrant about the accumulator usage
 * Fixed bug in Accumulator_CleanUp() which caused crashes"

When doing a win32 installation the details are hidden and only shown
very briefly. In some cases when doing an Exec on some of the OSSEC
command line tools it will spawn a cmd.exe that only appears for a
second. Some of the details those processes do are logged in the
ossec.log but it would be nice if they were also displayed in the details
window and those details can be reviewed.

Changed all Exec's to use ExecToLog so their details show up in the
installer details section.

Configured the details to be displayed by default and to not skip
past the details page automatically when the installation is completed.

This also has the added benefit of now popping up cmd.exe windows when
an installation takes place."

There were quite a few issues with the win32 service code that this
corrects. The first is that some of the comments in the code needed
to be updated. Looks like code was copied and reused but the comments
were not updated to reflect what the reused code was doing.

There was the potential in InstallService() where not all the service
handles would be closed if errors were hit at certain spots.

Before installing a new service the old service was not uninstalled.
This is desireable in the case where the new service has different
options or points to a different path location for example. In some
cases it might be bad where some type of user change was made but that
is difficult to account for. I leaned toward cleaning up the old so that
the new service can be installed fresh.

This also causes an error when the service goes to install because the service
already exists. This would actaully happen each time the OSSEC installer was ran
but due to some incorrect logging statements (which I'll explain below) a blank
line would appear.

When doing an uninstall of a service the service wasn't stopped prior to
the uninstallation. This would leave the service running until the service
was stopped or the computer rebooted at which point the service would dissappear.
It is better to stop the service before unintsalling. I'd imagine that is what
the user would expect to happen during such an operation.

The logging in this code was not done correctly. Namely, the call to merror()
in the InstallService() function after the ""install_error"" label was completely
wrong and would result in a nearly blank line in the logs. There were also reports
of times where a user would install the agent on a win32 machine and everything
would work except the service would never register. Fixing all of the logging to
use verbose() should hopeflly lead to better troubleshooting of errors like that
in the future."

Before when upgrading and doing a Rename after without the /Reboot command most of those commands would ""fail silently"" which is the best way I can describe it. It would just leave these files in the main ossec-agent directory never really upgrading parts of the system. Using the File command has the added benefit of complaining if a file is in use during the installation. For example have the win32ui.exe open and try to run a new installation. It hould complain that the file is inaccessible until the application is closed. Previously, this would just leave os_win32.exe in the ossec-agent directory and never successfully upgrade the executable."

When using the win32ui to change the server IP or import the
authentication key the permissions on ossec.conf and client.keys
were not set correctly resulting in any system user being able to
read the contents of these files.

This brought on some additional problems where the win32ui was unable
to properly detect if it was running with Administrative privileges.
The previous logic would attempt to read/write a .test file in the
OSSEC directory but thanks to a mixture of UAC redirection, an
unsigned binary and not requiring Administrative privileges these
tests would always pass. That means the win32ui would be able to run
without Administrative privileges.

This solution still isn't the best. It would be better if proper
win32 APIs were used to set permissions and determine if the win32ui
was started with the proper privileges. This is just an iterim
solution to get something out the door."

Although this helps with 2012 detection it is not perfect. With the
addition of Windows 8.1/2012 R2 the documentation provided by
Microsoft indicates that the GetVersionEx APIs have been deprecated.
This means that if you are on an 8.1 machine and run GetVersionEx it
will return the Windows 8 version (6.2.0.0). In order to get the
correct version you must target your application for Windows 8.1.

I am just trying to fix installations on 2012 and 2012 R2 so this

Accumulator allows the collection of data across multiple log entries by
decoding and grouping on an id field.  The cache for the accumulator
lasts:
    Default expire to 2 minutes (on lookup of exact key)
    Default purge count to 200 lookups (on lookup of any key)
    Default purge interval to 5 minutes (on lookup of any key)

== hash_op.(c|h)
* Change to design of the API, OSHash owns the key's memory, caller owns
  the data elements memory.
* OSHash_Add() strdup's the key
* OSHash_Free() now free()'s the key element
* OSHash_Delete() added so hashes can be dynamic

== accumulator.(c|h)
* This allows log lines to accumulate details based on the previous log
  entries which share the same id element.  Lines must contain, therefor
  the decoder must extract, the id element, or the accumulator simply
  returns without performing any action. It is important to note, this
  is not a multi-line reader, each log line is treated as it's own
  event.  As more data is learned about each ID, the events are able
  to use that data.
* Accumulate_Init() sets up the accumulator constants and initilizations
  variables
* Accumulate() performs the accumulation of event data. The default
  expiry for an event ID is 5 minutes of inactivity.
* Accumulate_CleanUp() is called once every 100 lookups or once every 10
  minutes, whichever happens first.

== etc/decoder.xml
* Enabled accumulator plugin for the OpenLDAP Decoder.  This allows for
  rules to be created with <same_source_ip/>, like with SSHD multiple
  login failures.

Bug fixes included:
 * Accumulator working with in-memory structs
 * Testrule.c now is very flagrant about the accumulator usage
 * Fixed bug in Accumulator_CleanUp() which caused crashes"

From the submission message:
patch 02: Configurable reconnection time on the ossec-agents.
We've added two new options to the ossec agent configuration in order to allow the user to configure the reconnection time and the time between keep alive messages.

 <ossec_config>
   <client>
      <server-ip>192.168.2.18</server-ip>
      <notify_time>120</notify_time>
      <time-reconnect>240</time-reconnect>
   </client>
 </ossec_config>
notify_time: time in seconds between information messages sent by the agents to the server
time-reconnect: Time in seconds until a reconnection attempt. This time have to be greater than the notify-time.

We've added some log traces to check that is working properly"

If you have more agents than what is specfied on MAX_AGENTS, syscheck (inside
analysisd) will happely go beyound the limit until the buffer overflows and
it crashes.

It means that if you have open agent registration (like using authd), someone
can create a bunch of fake agents until the manager crashes...

Patch recommended to anyone with lots of agents and/or allowing any system
to register as an agent.

*Thanks Paul for the detailed report."

Hello,

I encountered a segmentation fault in syscheck_control. After investigating I found the problem was the use of uninitialized pointers in src/shared/read-agents.c in the case of ""restored"" files (line 65). The pointers are used in the code starting on line 145.

I also discussed it last week on IRC with ddpbsd.

I propose the attached patch. Please review as I'm not familiar with the ossec code.

Best regards,

Rutger Sassen"

                functionality available in the manage_agents binary. After a
                bit of looking into it, it wasn't very hard to clone the
                functionality completely in a sane way using perl.
Features:
                - Add / Remove / List / Extract Key / Import agent
                - Makes it much easier to script ossec from the server and
                  agent side of things on a mass scale.
                - perl is sexy
Examples:
        ./ossec-batch-manager.pl -l # List all available agents

        # Add a new agent. The key and id will autogenerate unless
        # they are specified with the --id and --key options
        ./ossec-batch-manager.pl -a --name agent02 --ip 10.75.25.42
        ./ossec-batch-manager.pl -a --name agent02 --ip 10.75.25.42 --key '5a832efb8f93660857ce2acf8eec66a19fd9d4fa58e3221bbd2927ca8a0b40c3' --id 001

        ./ossec-batch-manager.pl -e 001 # Extract the key of 001

        # Import a key extracted from the server onto an agent
