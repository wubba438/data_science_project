The heap layout is now saved when saving structure definitions to avoid
having to reconstruct it at load-time.
The obsolete instance type has been added, this instance uses an
OBSOLETE-INSTANCE-LAYOUT as the header layout instead of a regular
LAYOUT. Accesses to slots should use the new instance instead of the
obsolete instance. This maintains object identity when instances are
made obsolete, but allows the object layout to change.
The GC will rewrite pointers to the old obsolete instance to point at
the new instance to eliminate the indirection overhead.
Some funcallable instances were two words too short, CLOS boot was
not correctly computing the layout for those classes correctly.
Metaobject slot accessors that use a hard-coded location now only do
so on direct instances of their metaobjects, not subclasses. Slot
locations in a superclass may not be valid subclasses.
DEFSTRUCT was not using the short layout representation for fully
unboxed structs.
The file compiler has been updated for the new world."

This largely eliminates the slowdown from deep binding, with the cache
having a hit rate of around 90-95%.

The cache is a 128 entry array stored directly in the thread object,
replacing the old TLS array. It is currently index by the low bits of
the symbol address, but this could be replaced by any hash for the symbol.
The cache is updated when there is a miss, when a special variable is
bound (a recently bound special variable will probably be accessed soon),
and when a binding is undone (because it is no longer valid).

This currently relies on the fact that symbols and their value cells
are wired. Changes to the GC and cache index will be needed if
this changes."

NOTE: All .LLF files must be rebuilt!
This completely solves the ever-expanding-stack problem that
MULTIPLE-VALUE-PROG1 had, makes the GC immune to stray stale DX values
and obsoletes the stack mark bit, which has been removed now.

DX values are now allocated using two different methods, depending on
whether their size is know at compile time or not.
If the size is known, then they will be allocated directly in the
function's stack frame as scannable/live values.
Otherwise, they are allocated on the stack, and a value to the object
tagged with +TAG-DX-ROOT-OBJECT+ will be stored in the stack frame. Only
objects can be allocated this way, not conses. Allocating an arbitrary
number of conses requires them to be wrapped in a simple-vector, possible
because conses are normally represented without any header.

The GC will ignore any values that point to the stack area unless they
have the +TAG-DX-ROOT-OBJECT+ tag. Such values are only permitted to
exist in a function's stack-frame. In other words, they are internal to
the GC and should not be treated as real Lisp values. A real Lisp value
must be tagged with +TAG-OBJECT+ instead. They should remain live for as
long as the dynamic-extent allocation.

Arbitrary-size allocations are not currently exposed by the compiler and
are only used internally for &REST lists and M-V-PROG1's value save area."

stack pointer now, so interrupt stack groups can be eliminated.

Control stack sizes have been doubled to make up for the extra load, and to
take the space of the removed data stacks.
Backtracing must now examine return addresses and recover function objects
from them, instead of reading it from a magic stack slot.
The GC is broken, but will be fixed in part II or III!
Some assembly functions have been updated, some have not.

because tag had been killed before unbind-to, smash-r8 would happily
clear r8 without saving, leading to a missing tag bug."
