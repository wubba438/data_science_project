In strict mode, function declarations in local scope are block scoped (like const/let), but NormalizePass incorrectly assumes they're function scoped (like var) and rewrites them as `var x = function() { ... }`. This breaks code when the function shadows a variable in an outer scope.

Fortunately, MakeDeclaredNamesUnique already handles function declarations correctly. Therefore, we can fix this bug by uniquifying names before other normalizations, so that any introduced `var`s are guaranteed not to shadow other variables.

Note that it wouldn't be possible to fix this by rewriting function declarations into a `let x = function() { ... }` instead, since normalization occurs after transpilation and this would break pre-ES6 output.

The existing JS code which uses this code pattern  gets away with it because ClosureRewriteModule pass rewrites the code to assign to a qualified name, instead of making it a const declaration. (due to export inlining). Since we will be moving closureRewriteModule pass to run after Polymer pass, we need
to make the Polymer pass handle the const declarations of Polymer classes.

CollapseProperties will currently transform `var a = x || {b: 1}; var t = a.b` into `var a = x || {b: 1}; var t = a$b`, which causes a crash because `a$b` is never declared. A similar issue exists when the initializer is a ternary expression.

We should back off from collapsing property reads/writes when the property is declared in an or-expression or ternary-expression, since the declaration itself is never collapsed. However, property writes to undeclared properties are still safe to collapse, e.g. `var a = x || {b: 1}; a.c = 2` => `var a = x || {b: 1}; var a$c = 2`.

JS Compiler incremental compilation works by simplifying down each file to just what's needed for type-checking, so that it runs faster.

By default, object literal property right-hand-sides are simplified to ""0"", since the value doesn't usually matter. However, in the case of Polymer Behaviors the RHS does matter, because the PolymerPass uses it to understand which properties the behavior is going to set on the Polymer Elements that apply it.

This change preserves any property called ""properties"" on an object literal that is annotated with @polymerBehavior, and simplifies it so that only the necessary type information is preserved.

Polymer classes have a `$` property that is used as a dictionary-like object. Client code often does stuff like `this.$.someProp` to access these properties. Left unmodified, JSCompiler would complain about these, because it doesn't have sufficient type information on `this.$` to know what properties exist on it. So, the Polymer pass converts `this.$.someProp` to `this.$['someProp']`, which JSCompiler won't complain about, because it doesn't look into the values used for bracket access.

The logic of the Polymer pass sometimes does this conversion when it shouldn't, because it cannot tell which properties named `$` really belong to a Polymer object and which don't. This is a problem for some method calls that are accessed as something.$.someMethod().

This CL makes the Polymer pass a bit smarter by avoiding the conversion when the `something.$.someProp` is the callee of a function call. None of the properties of a Polymer `$` property should be functions to call, so this avoids incorrect conversion for those cases.

The problem was that for every default param, we have a node DEFAULT_VALUE
which holds the lhs(identifier NAME) and rhs(default value). We attach the
inline JsDocInfo to the lhs (NAME node), but  we push its parent DEFAULT_VALUE
into the function param list. So while searching for JsDoc info in the function's param list, we do not look into the child NAME node which holds the JsDoc info.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Breaks sourcemap generation in JS version of the compiler

*** Original change description ***

Switch the JS implementation of the transpiler to be created using J2CL rather than GWT.

This change restructures the generation process a bit because we can now optimize using the compiler itself and we don't have to unzip GWT JARs.

There's a 20% size increase in the transpiler following this change. As a next step this could be mitigated by better tailoring the resource files shipped with the transpiler, most of which are unused.

The open(...), close(), write(...) and writeln(...) methods on Document are
now part of the standard and have been moved to w3c_dom1.js to reflect this.

The typing of Document.prototype.close has been aligned with the specification
and with the overriding close methods in HTMLDocument.

The overrides  of close(), write() and writeln() in HTMLDocument have been
removed. This is done due to limitations of the jsinterop-generator tool that
is more fully described in google/jsinterop-generator#35 While the specifications
explicitly indicate that these overrides are present and annotates (requiring the
[OverrideBuiltins] attribute be applied to the containing interface in
WebIDL) it is not expected that this has any practical impact on programs
type checking against the externs.

Renames may include:
- containsAllOf => containsAtLeast
- containsAllIn => containsAtLeastElementsIn
- isSameAs => isSameInstanceAs
- isOrdered => isInOrder
- isStrictlyOrdered => isInStrictOrder

The other major change is to change custom subjects to extend raw Subject instead of supplying type parameters. The type parameters are being removed from Subject. This CL will temporarily produce rawtypes warnings, which will go away when I remove the type parameters (as soon as this batch of CLs is submitted).

Some CLs in this batch also migrate calls away from actualAsString(). Its literal replacement is `""<"" + actual + "">""` (unless an object overrides actualCustomStringRepresentation()), but usually I've made a larger change, such as switching from an old-style ""Not true that..."" failure message to one generated with the Fact API. In that case, the new code usually contains a direct reference to this.actual (a field that I occasionally had to create). Another larger change I sometimes made is to switch from a manual check-and-fail approach to instead use check(...). And sometimes I just remove a withMessage() call that's no longer necessary now that the code uses check(...), or I introduce a check(...) call. (An assertion made with check(...) automatically includes the actual value from the original subject, so there's no need to set it again with withMessage().)

Finally, there's one CL in this batch in which I migrate a Correspondence subclass to instead use Correspondence.from.

The traversal algorithms also updated to look primary parents first.
Although the existing algorithm works ok with current rules, when we start including implemented interfaces of the abstract classes in traverse, it will start returning incorrect results.

For example;

class Parent { /** @return {string} */ foo(){} }
class Sub extends Parent {}
class IParent { /** @return {*} */ foo(){} }
/** @implements {IParent} */
class Child extends Sub {}

even the closest definition of Child.foo is IParent.foo per BFS traversal, Parent.foo is the most authoritative one and dictates the return type if the method (i.e. string).

getImpureBooleanValue() could successfully calculate values for more
complex expressions than getLiteralBooleanValue() could and delegated
to getLiteralBooleanValue() for cases it didn't specifically handle.

The merged method is intended to act like getImpureBooleanValue()

This change helps to unblock a refactoring of mayHaveSideEffects()
s.t. it will always have access to the compiler object.

A recent change removed the one case where getStringValue() was actually
checking for side effects. The peephole optimizations may have been
relying on this behavior in some way that is hard to see clearly.
So, to reduce the risk of present or future bugs, I'm changing them
to explicitly check for side effects when calling getStringValue().

In a couple of places we've been using getPureBooleanValue() in order
to exclude the broader logic of getImpureBooleanValue(), but we don't
actually care about side-effects. Using getLiteralBooleanValue()
is more appropriate in those places, and unblocks refactoring of the
side effect logic methods.

getStringValue() consistently ignores the possibility of side-effects
other than its one call to getPureBooleanValue() in the case of
'!something', which seems like an unintentional difference.

CheckSuspiciousCode had a comment specifically saying it wanted to
ignore side-effects just above the call to getPureBooleanValue()

NEW:
Code now explicitly distinguishes among pure, literal, and impure
boolean values. Previous code conflated pure and literal leading to the
mistake that caused the rollback. See detailed explanation of what
these terms mean in the javadoc for the methods.

Rewrote the tests in a way that ensures all three ways of interpreting
an expression as a boolean value are tested for each example expression.

Also, the previous version unintentionally included a bunch of formatting
changes on unchanged code. These have been removed.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Appears to be unused (tsickle never generates this pattern).

*** Original change description ***

Allow multiple exports of the typescript namespace pattern

Typescript currently emits this pattern for exports of multiply defined
namespaces. So long as the RHS is an object literal, this doesn't violate any
of our assumptions for module rewriting.

This patch makes first module type that's recognized by JsFileParser as the module type and also stops recording the provided namespace in cases of module type conflict.

As a result of module type conflicts that are due to inaccurate parsing done via JsFileParser are less dangerous since the top one will win which is most likely the correct one.

The criterion for a valid @define initializer is that it be a statically-computable expression containing only literals or other @defines, but existing code used a naïve string-keyed map to determine whether an RHS name was a @define, which fails to understand modules and aliases.

To fix this, we now do an extra pass over all global declarations to find any additional valid aliases, repeating until a fixed point is found.

Also moves isValidDefineValue out of NodeUtil, since this is the only place it should ever be used.

Unlike a typical forward reference to a type, which are resolved through NamedType, references to goog.requireType types in goog.modules are currently broken. This is because in cases like

  const Data = goog.requireType('mod.Data');
  let /** !Data */ data;

TypedScopeCreator has already traversed the name ""Data"" local to the module. Making a NamedType to resolve ""Data"" is ineffective - we never declare the name ""Data"" in the module scope.

Two ways of fixing this problem are:
  1) (this CL) visit all goog.requireType imports after all module scopes have been created, but before type resolution.
  2) modify type resolution to make ""Data""'s NamedType (and types referencing properties of ""Data"") resolve in the scope of 'mod.Data', not the current module. This seems more complicated. JSTypeRegistry would have to know that the type name ""Data"" should actually be resolved in some other scope completely when inside a given module.

 - We soon will move provide/require rewriting after typechecking, but don't care about

 - This pass is huge.

We also plan to remove the require rewriting eventually, and consolidate rewriting for requires in ES modules/goog.modules/goog.provide files/scripts.

It was only needed to prevent confusing compiler crashes in NTI.  Classic type inference builds the necessary information directly into the type registry so it will not crash.

This should have no visible effect on any existing working builds.  The worst reasonable unintended consequence is either (1) code that was failing with this error will now fail with a compiler crash, or (2) code that was failing with this error will now succeed to compile but produce invalid results.  I do not believe either of these to be remotely likely, but even if it did happen it would not be detectable with a presubmit test, since digging through the already-failing builds is not feasible.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Test failure in release with this included, still under investigation.

*** Original change description ***

Change hoisting of externs and 'nocompile' files to use faster DependencyInfo parsing.

- Added PrebuildAST to bundle generation as some builds were hitting StackOverflows.

- Set module resolution mode and roots in JsMessageExtractorRunner, as it was failing for some targets when parsing some ES6 imports.

- Remove tests that tested bad requires, etc., as the dependency parsing will output an error before it hits any error in the rest of jscomp.

Removes the 'declare' pragma that was previously used in global.js, but was implicitly needed by other runtime libraries as well - though this fact was papered over by the Es6ExternsCheck.  Instead, we maintain a list of symbols in VarCheck that will be declared in externs at the end of the pass if they have not been encountered yet.  This is necessary because runtime libraries are injected *after* the first run of VarCheck, so any undeclared (normally externed) symbols in those files will cause undeclared variables that would crash later passes.

This approach is cleaner than conditioanlly declaring the symbols because (a) it avoids duplicate declarations, and (b) it leads to consistent behavior regardless of whether or not certain runtime libraries are included.

This change unblocks removing Es6ExternsCheck, ensuring that the compiler will not crash if no externs are provided.  Type checking runtime libraries without externs is not yet supported.

Recursive typedefs are not supposed to be possible, but there's a way to create them using forward-referenced named types. If such a recursive type is checked against a separate-but-equivalent @record or @typedef type, the type checker currently blows up with infinite recursion. This can be prevented by taking advantage of the ImplCache in PrototypeObjectType#isSubtype.

Doing this correctly requires carefully threading the needle through the various special cases and overrides of isSubtype, particularly due to a separate structural-subtype check that sometimes runs in addition to the version in PrototypeObjectType - if it reports (and caches) a different result then we end up with problems in union coalescing (either under- or over-collapsing), missing property detection, or various other places.
This CL attempts to consolidate the two structural checks into one by adding some extra dimensions to the check: (1) whether the supertype is an inline record literal or not (to determines which properties to match) and (2) whether to require explicitly voidable supertype props to be present in the subtype.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Caused crashes with CAST nodes missing @type JSDoc

*** Original change description ***

Resolve CAST types immediately after evaluation

Currently they are resolved after TypeInference runs on all scopes, in TypeInferencePass.

This is a problem when other code in the TypeInference pass tries to read properties off those types. It causes unknown type warnings when trying to delete InlineTypeAliases.

By default zip files created via URL connection supports caching. However this built-in cache never invalidate and we don't want that since zip file contents might change over time.

Earlier attempt to fix this issue killed caching completely which resulted in each individual entry to be independently loaded from the zip archive. That is very inefficient especially for big zip files.

This patch replaces earlier workaround with a timestamp controlled caching so we avoid inefficient re-reads.

With this CL, since it is no longer I/O bounded highly parallel parsing of AST (8+ threads) is 3x faster while the total time of bundling reduced by 40-50% (for J2CL sample app).

The improvement should reflect similarly for other tools (MF, MSS) as well but I didn't measure how much that will be.

The chosen default cache size of 1000 has memory impact around 5MB which is negligible (this is because ZipFile is already designed to be cached indefinitely by JDK since that is default behavior for URLs). Memory testing results/methodology could be found here:

*** Reason for rollback ***

This breaks the Google Transparency Report.

The Google TR is currently crashing with the error ""google is not defined"" in compiled mode.

This problem will happen on any website that uses the standard [] externs rule, and has any dependency that does a goog.provide for google.*. This is because the common externs has an extern for
""var google = {}"". In the case of Transparency Report, it's because we depend on the public Google Charts API, which provides the namespace 'google.charts'.

*** Original change description ***

Remove a little known feature from RescopeGlobalSymbols that rewrites most extern variables from e.g. `document` to `window.document`.

This was added (by me) to allow for chunks to be applied to multiple windows. Nobody is using it that way, and our current usage would like to avoid the overhead in bytes and runtime cost.

NodeUtil.isLiteralValue may return true for null values even isNull may not return true. Hence we cannot deduct that an expression's value is non-null from (isNodeLiteral && !isNull) check. We have been doing this for very long time but fortunately it was a very corner case nobody hit.

This CL stops using isLiteralValue and instead use getKnownValueType to detect which cases are safe to optimize. This will also help us to cover more cases and help to refactor Equality.same to Object.is semantics later.

GlobalNamespace now stores STRING_KEY nodes in object patterns as references to qualified names. For example, in

This requires CollapseProperties and AggressiveInlineAliases to understand how to change values assigned to destructuring lvalues. For example, CollapseProperties needs to replace  `const {z} = x.y;` with `const z = x$y$z;`. This may help code size, but more importantly fixes some incorrect optimization bugs

The JSCore bug is https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182414 and triggers when var declarations shadow parameters.

This CL prevents CoalesceVariableNames from creating 'var' redeclarations. The only cases where this was happening were when a single declaration contained multiple lvalues, either in a destructuring pattern or a let/const in a for-loop, so we back off on those.

This also fixes an actual compiler crash when renaming variables in destructuring patterns in enhanced for loops.

By taking advantage of RemoveUnusedCode's better logic, we are able to do significantly better removal than we could before (in particular, removing the Set polyfill no longer leaves the Map and WeakMap polyfills behind).  This introduces a direct dependency on type information into RemoveUnusedCode where previously it relied entirely on disambiguation for type awareness.  Without type information, polyfills may still be removed, but the accuracy is poorer (unused polyfills may not be removed, and used polyfills that are hidden on aliases may be incorrectly removed).

This CL does not actually switch over to the new logic in DefaultPassConfig yet.  We will do that in a follow-up CL to minimize the size of potentially breaking changes in case of rollbacks.

This polyfill is slightly incorrect for IE8 and IE9, where it performs no rounding at all. This is generally not a problem, since Math.fround is primarily used for optimization (to force faster 32-bit operations rather than 64-bit), but in cases where (a) the logic actually depends on a correct fround implementation and (b) the application targets very old browsers, this polyfill will be insufficient.  For that case, see https://gist.github.com/shicks/7a97ec6b3f10212e60a89a7f6d2d097d for a more correct polyfill that does not depend on Float32Array.

On the other hand, the incorrect (but faster) behavior can be enabled unconditionally for all browsers by setting $jscomp.SIMPLE_FROUND_POLYFILL to true.  This will safe a few bytes and make the operation faster for non-ES6 browsers.

A tagged template literal has both a raw version and a cooked version. The raw version has not had escape sequences expanded, while a cooked version has.

This change implements this optimization for the trivial but common case where the cooked and raw versions of the string are exactly the same.

In a couple of lit-html app that make heavy use of tagged template literals this reduced the js binary size by 1-2% after compression. Before compression the savings are much  larger, 20-25% bytes saved. Turns out compression algorithms are good at compressing long identical strings.

The newly introduced check models the legal return types from async code as a union type (which they essentially are) so that a subtype test is sufficient to verify them. There is a risk that synthesizing union types like these could lead to very verbose error messages, but it's thought that the error case being clarified (see bug) is more common.

This CL also tightens the requirements on async function to return no kind of union, including unions with `null` or `undefined`. This was required to make the return type validation correct, but also deemed more accurate. Nullable unions were initially supported as a compromise but on consideration seemed not particularly valuable.

This is now possible by actually adding the `MyString` property to the namespace type (it was omitted before, defined only in the registry), and then checking the definition node for the new annotation. This annotation is also transferred when a typedef is aliased directly.

This approach is sub-optimal, since it does not consolidate the handling of other kinds of type names, whose types are easily derived from their value types (specifically, constructors and enum objects). It would be nice if typedef objects could also store their typename types, but since most enums are undefined or objects, this would require additional proxying and leads to a mess figuring out where to add the new declarations and not conflict with the subset of typedefs that were already previously being declared. On the other hand, this approach could be consolidated to also include class and enum names, which we may pursue in the future.

Fix bug in AggressiveInlineAliases causing properties to be set to null

This bug was causing bad code to be output by the optimizations. AggressiveInlineAliases would inline constructor properties that also aliased another name, setting the ctor property to null, while there were still indirect references to the ctor property through an alias.

This change is not a safe optimization, but being slightly unsafe here works around CollapseProperties being unsafe. This relaxes the following condition in AggressiveInlineAliases:
  the pass will inline aliases of a name a.b.c only if the parent names a and a.b are never aliased/escaped

  Now, the pass will also inline aliases of a.b.c /if/ CollapseProperties will (possibly unsafely) collapse ""a.b.c"" -> ""a$b$c"", even if a or a.b are still aliased. Note that the InlineTypeAliases pass already inlined ""a.b.c"" even if ""a"" or ""a.b"" escaped, making it less likely that this CL will cause new errors.

This CL also fixes a bug in AggressiveInlineAliases related to nested assigns
  a = b, c = d;
which testing the above change uncovered.

Fix bug in AggressiveInlineAliases causing properties to be set to null

This bug was causing bad code to be output by the optimizations. AggressiveInlineAliases would inline constructor properties that also aliased another name, setting the ctor property to null, while there were still indirect references to the ctor property through an alias.

I changed GlobalNamespace to only special case @constructor's when checking 'is this name collapsible', but not when checking 'is this name inlinable?'. Now AggressiveInlineAliases will wait to set a constructor property to null until the constructor is never escaped/aliased.

This CL contains branching logic to minimize the change to InlineAliases (a.k.a. InlineTypeAliases), because changing that pass causes new type errors. We can remove the logic after the typechecker handles nullability of aliased enums/typedef correctly.

Background:
This is a follow up to a change which had previously switched
to using goog.exportProperty instead of our own externs interface.
That change did fix two of our bugs for class-based code, but not legacy code,
and also caused a regression in user bundle size (see attached bugs).
The new approach in this change fixes the original bugs for both styles of code,
and also restores bundle size back to where it was before.

For more context, please see the JSDoc on the createExportsAndExterns function,
where I've documented all the different approaches I looked at,
and why this one seems to be the best.
(I'm also totally open to other approaches of course).

*** Reason for rollback ***

Rollforward and fixing original issue that caused the rollback.

The fix includes:
- During code generation, instead of just using the raw string when generating template literals, use function escapeUnrecognizedCharacters to escape characters that might be misinterpreted later on. However, for characters such as \n and \u2028 we still use the actual raw character as is.

*** Original change description ***

Allow invalid escape sequences in tagged template literals.

The ""raw"" property on template literal substrings is always set as the string exactly as typed in input, but if the escape sequence is invalid, the ""cooked"" value of the template literal would be undefined.

Also update tranpilation of template literals to reflect the change.

Update the code generator to always use raw strings in template literals.

As part of the fix, change TemplateLit nodes to have TemplateLiteralSubstringNode children rather than String children, and updated affected files to reflect the change.

To prevent spurious warnings on template parameter types (which are allowed to be unqualified), do not warn on type names that appear in @template annotations in the same file. Because the check is purely syntactical (no type information), this incurs in some false positives and negatives. However, they are rare enough that it seems worthwhile to keep this check in the linter.

Also take the opportunity to add ""void"" to the list of primitive type names.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Added special-casing of template parameter types to prevent spurious warnings.

*** Original change description ***

Automated g4 rollback of changelist 212058481.

*** Reason for rollback ***

The new linter will incorrectly warn on an unqualified template parameter, e.g.

    /** @constructor @template T */ function Foo() {}
    /** @param {T} x */ Foo.prototype.bar = function(x) {};

will warn that the T in @param needs a ! or ?.

Rolling back to prevent a bad linter release.

This makes it so that one can create custom error printing set-ups by passing
a strategy to the standard error manager, rather than always needing to create
a subclass.  As an example, converted the JSON stream report generator from
a subclass of the standard error manger to an instance of the new interface.

The end goal is to support multiple different ErrorReportGenerators to run
within a single compiler, like for example to print out normally formatted
messages to the console and at the same time also print JSON formatted messages
to an extra output file.

Currently, passing an empty file into ConvertToTypedInterface within a test results in a ""deleted scope was not reported"" crash, because the deletion is reported to the deleted node itself, not the parent. It doesn't seem to be possible to report to the parent (the root) because it is neither a script nor a function. Therefore I'm removing the code that deletes empty files.

One test has to change because the synthetic ""fill files"" created by the compiler to populate otherwise empty chunks are now visible in the IJS output. We might want to figure out a way to get rid of them in the future.

This is a followup to CL 211408645. After this change, the module graph will be the single point of truth for the module and input lists.

Since `modules` is initialized to the same value that gets passed into the `JSModuleGraph` constructor, we can replace any reference to the former by a call to `moduleGraph.getModules()` (which now returns an iterable, rather than a list).

Some care must be taken on `restoreState`, which needs to update the names of the deserialized modules to match the preexisting ones. To avoid concurrent modification, a copy of the previous module list must be made.

The `inputs`, `modules` and `moduleGraph` compiler data structures overlap, which violates the SPOT rule and makes maintenance of the compiler's internal state more error-prone. This CL remedies part of the problem by removing `inputs` in favor of a `JSModuleGraph#getAllInputs` method, which returns an iterable over inputs in dependency order.

Note that it's already the case that `inputs` is in dependency order, since `initModules` and `rebuildInputsFromModules` (two of the three places where `inputs` is set, the third being `restoreState`) already initialize it in that manner. Thus, in most places where `inputs` occurs, we can simply replace it by a `moduleGraph.getAllInputs()` call. The exceptions are the methods that mutate the module graph: `hoistExterns` and `hoistNoCompileFiles`. In both cases, iteration must be over a copy of `getAllInputs()` to prevent concurrent modification.

Also note that, in `orderInputs`, passing `inputs` as an argument into `JSModuleGraph#manageDependencies` is redundant, since the graph itself contains that information.

Finally, a couple of places verify that the compiler has been initialized by a null check on `inputs`. These must be replaced by a null check on `moduleGraph`.

The existence of the setJs and setJsZip methods is thus redundant, and in fact, the CommandLineConfig implementation never does anything with what they receive.

Also note that all existing calls to setJs and setJsZip are already accompanied by an equivalent call to setMixedJsSources.

As a result of an upcoming change to the JSCompiler, additional issues have been surfaced in downstream code, including yours. This CL is a preparatory step to prevent build errors and test failures when the main change lands. The goal is to unblock progress by the JS Infrastructure team with the smallest possible overhead.

Additional suppressions or loosened types present in this change are not new, they are simply being made more visible. Any code that worked before the upcoming change should continue to work afterward. The JS Infrastructure team has neither the domain knowledge nor resources to actually fix all revealed issues, but we warmly encourage you to do so when possible.

This does still back off on references inside function scopes, to handle cases where functions definitions are hoisted to the beginning of a block but called later.

`NamedType` instances used to only be compared based on their string references. Now, if they have been successfully resolved they will be compared based on their underlying (proxied) type instances, else fall back to comparing strings.

This change is not a complete fix because:
  - `NamedType` equality should also consider scopes
  - There is some ambiguity between forward declared types and `NoResolvedType` I haven't been able to unravel.
Fixing these has been punted in favour of an incremental improvement.

As a confirmation that this change is positive and to help prevent the contract from slipping further, `assertTypeEquals` in the ""jstype"" unit tests is being updated to compare `hashCode()` in addition to `equals()`.

This change is a step towards adding support for ES6 class syntax. It is necessary because class syntax creates new ways of referencing properties that the existing code didn't model well. Refactoring to this abstraction allows us to reuse the existing logic, which is large, complex, and fragile.

A number of latent errors in access control checking were discovered during this change (unchecked l-value syntaxes, ambiguity between override/overload/access). These issues are left as is since this is intended to have minimal impact on behaviour. Fixes will come later.

A bunch of code is forked from `AccessControlUtils` into `CheckAccessControls` to support the new abstraction. A tracking bug exists for reconciliation.

When a class node has an UnknownType rather than a FunctionType (this can happen when the class is immediately inside a CAST node to unknown, though I'm not positive that that's the root cause), trying to cast the type to FunctionType fails.  In general, casting JSType is almost always the wrong thing to do.  Instead, JSType.toMaybeFunctionType is much safer.

This can happen if an IIFE defines the superclass on a global qualified name.  Previously it gave up when the name was not found in the scope, and so made a class with Object as its superclass.

This initial support uses a partial, hacky workaround in order to exactly reproduce the same warnings as type checking pre-transpiled code.  A more correct implementation would be based on the type of `this` in the static method, but currently `this` in static methods are treated as unknown, so tightening that would introduce many new errors across the codebase, which would block moving class transpilation to after type checking.  Instead, we will tighten the types in a later step.

This is the last known blocker for type checking classes natively.  Once this is in, we should be able to move class transpilation to after type checking.

This is needed to generate unique names for variables. Today we achieve that by treating each block scope as an anonymous function scope and generating ""function%n"" symbol for all block scopes. That leads to a lot of unnecessary symbols which are ""not clickable"" and generally misleading.

Instead ""function%n"" will be generated only for actual function scopes. But we still need to generate unique names for variables and block indices will help with that: we prepend containing scope indices to variable name making it unique.

`typeof x === 'undefined'` is the strict mode compliant way to check if a

TypeScript. TypeScript emits code snippets under certain situations that check
for the presence of a variable and use it if it is defined. We could suppress
`checkVars` in the emit, but we'd rather not, given the check is valuable.

It does still require some special handling to look for names in this special type of scope, but the lifetime of this overlay is now much cleaner.

For type resolution within the body, the types are actually added into the registry at the proper scope root, and vars are added to the scope so that JSTypeRegistry#getLookupScope is able to find them correctly.  This has the chance to shadow outer names, but that shouldn't cause any problems.

This isn't a super important usecase, but I was curious why instrumentation was broken and it turned out it was a classic case of unintended property renaming.

coverage instrumentation works by populating a special object called '__jscov' on the window object with coverage metadata.  This means that we need to ensure that both __jscov itself and its various sub properties are not renamed since the code that ultimately reads this data is not part of the same compilation unit.

Export the gjd method of JsfileParser in the same JS module as the GwtRunner.

This are slightly awkward since GwtRunner already is using default exports. So the module is the compile function that has the gjd function as a property. To make things slightly less confusing I've also added the compile function as a property of itself, so that the module may be treated either as the compile function or namespace with the compile and gjd functions.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Causes breakages and compiler crashes internally.

*** Original change description ***

Support basic ES6 class syntax in typed scope creation

So far, we only support the class and extends keyword and an optional constructor method.  All other methods are ignored and will probably cause an error if left untranspiled (since TypedScopeCreator will not annotate them with types).

This should unblock work on class visibility.

LocalScopeBuilder and GlobalScopeBuilder were basically doing the same thing, with the only difference being how function scopes were handled.  With ES6 block scoping, function scopes are much more limited: they never include any statements and therefore don't have any declarations.  This change combines the existing two concrete ScopeBuilder subclasses into a NormalScopeBuilder, but pulls out the separate behavior for FunctionScopeBuilder into its own place, differentiated by completely different shouldTraverse() and visit() logic.

It turns out that much of the complex type creation logic is actually still needed in both, since blockless arrow functions and default parameter initializers still allow object literals to exist directly in function scopes - so parsing JSDoc function declarations (etc) is still required.  But we can get by with less branching and special casing in shouldTraverse, and this opens the door to a separate ClassScopeBuilder in the near future with its own separate logic.

The new version is comparable in overall performance (inferSlotType() is about 3x slower, but getSlot(), equals(), and JoinOp are all about 3x faster), but is much cleaner and easier to reason about.  There is no longer a separate cache, so there's no longer any need for duplicated logic between the linked list and the cache.  Moreover, with the nested maps, it's now trivial to remove inner block scopes when they are exited, or qualified names when their receivers should be invalidated (see #2854).

Previously compiling a loop like:
for(var i = 0, n = 5; i < n; i++) {}
resulted in mangling of variable references, but not the declarations:
for(var i = 0, n = 5; i$$test < n$$test; i$$test++) {}

This happened, because name mangler skipped multi-variable declarations under assumptions that they would be split into separate statements per variable. At the same time, the code splitting the declarations bailed on for loop initializers (because there can be only one initializer statement).

The offending code was added in https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/commit/71b36e83b928ce63fa66f727f744ff2aefbe647c and https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/commit/6f43ec65e570b983a46bc7a652e42f89f1f92e67.

Why we need two splitMultipleDeclarations (in updateNameReference as well as in RewriteModule.visit) is beyond me. I suspect that this code is still not 100% correct, but better than before.

This method exists solely to support short-circuiting AND and OR.

We already had logic to add parentheses when the object literal was the only thing being returned, but not when the object literal or object pattern was more deeply nested in an expression.

To do this I added two states to the CodeGenerator.Context enum. One is for when we are at the start of an arrow function body and the other is for the case where we are both in an arrow function body and inside a for loop init clause.

(Deciding to add parentheses by recursing to see the leftmost child is an object lit caused some unnecessary parentheses: e.g. in cases where something like a cast also added parentheses before the ""{"", I was adding parentheses twice)

This leads to confusing unit test behavior, causing incorrect behavior for
one test case in TypeCheckTest and correct behavior for the wrong reason in others.

2. Also create TestExternsBuilder class.

This class provides a way to build exactly the externs definitions needed for a test
case rather than continually adding definitions to one or more ""default"" externs
variables that grow ever larger creating a performance drain on test cases that don't
need most of the definitions they contain.

2. Declare qualified names on their owner's scope: this is a slight behavior change that improves type inference.  It's included in this change because with the introduction of block scopes, the question of which scope to declare a qualified name on is becoming more nuanced, so it helps to start by making the behavior more consistent.

Background: CL 181680335 fixed/generalized the equals and hashCode behavior of Var and TypedVar, which previously only depended on the definition node, to instead depend on the name and the root node of the scope in which the name was defined.  Importantly, this preserved the property that Vars needn't share the same scope creator to be equal, but was still required to be an instance of AbstractVar, which requires a corresponding AbstractScope.  This CL loosens that requirement, in particular by providing a simple value type `ScopedName.of(name, node)` which can be used alongside (e.g.) TypedVar as keys in the same ScopedName-keyed map.  This is a step toward supporting block scopes in OTI (#2796).

This is a prerequisite for handling block scoping correctly: to ensure names are defined in the correct order, TypedScopeCreator needs to create nested block scopes when they are encountered in the createScope traversal, rather than afterwards.  This is required for, e.g. `if (true) { class Base {} } class Sub extends Base {}`.  TypedScopeCreator can now create these scopes and be sure they are correctly memoized.  This is straightforward since every usage of TypedScopeCreator was always wrapped in MemoizedTypedScopeCreator.  The upshot is that MemoizedTypedScopeCreator can now be deleted.

Add the ""strictMissingProperties"" diagnostic group.  While the current ""missingProperties"" warnings report when a property can't be found on the type or any of its subtypes, when the ""strictMissingProperties"" diagnostic group is enabled, the type check will report references to properties that are not declared on that type.

As the subtype property references are typed as ""unknown"" this encourages patterns that less frequently into pits of cascading unknowns.

The historic ""missingProperties"" check was implemented they way it was in no small part because of the awkwardness of typing the DOM API (knowning which subclass of Node/Element you are expecting, etc) and it is expected that this will continue to be the case here that it is awkward.

Also here, we hack the suppression guard so that ""checkTypes"" and ""missingProperties"" include the ""strictMissingProperties"" warnings when they are used for suppressions.

Note this CL lays a solid foundation for these checks but there are two areas of follow up:
property assignments and properties of unions types require additional unit tests.

Previously they were keyed off of nameNode, but this has two problems: (1) nameNode can be null, such as in TypedScopeCreator#declareNativeType, or in many unit tests - in this case hashCode would throw; (2) nameNode is not always unique for different variables (particularly qualified names).  Additionally, TypedVar did not satisfy the equals contract since Var.equals(TypedVar) could return true while TypedVar.equals(Var) would return false.

The new approach is to compare the variable's name and its scope's root node.  Both of these things should never be null, and together they actually *do* uniquely identify the variable.  We no longer distinguish between Var and TypedVar: they can now freely equal each other if they refer to the same symbol in the code.

This allows all var instances to be used safely as map keys (rather than just some), which is important for teaching the type checker about ES6 scopes.  Control flow graphs are necessarily at function granularity, rather than block, so with ES6 scoping variable names alone are no longer sufficient to track the flow of data through different blocks.

Note that identity semantics is incorrect here since vars can be stored and compared across traversals (i.e. different scopes).  This also has the benefit of allowing to remove some of the special (and less correct) handling for arguments variables.

This fixes some bugs in CoalesceVariableNames in ES6 mode where variables in dead destructuring assignments were incorrectly being coalesced. It also changes the AST traversal in LiveRangeChecker to visit the rhs of a destructuring assignment/declaration before the lhs, since that's how it's evaluated.

For example, it stops the compiler from coalescing ""a"" and ""b"" in
  var a = 2;
  var {b} = {};

This change has two main consequences:
1. Some code that was previously considered to be ES5 will now be marked as ES6, resulting in transpilation occurring in test runners, bundlers, and debug loaders.  If LANGUAGE_IN is explicitly set to ES5, or if ES6 externs are missing, it's possible that builds could break.
2. A possible behavior change for ambiguous block-scoped declarations.  The code `function f(){return 1;} {function f(){return 2;}} console.log(f());` will print '2' in sloppy mode, but '1' in ES6 strict mode (and is an error in ES5 strict mode).  Depending on a variety of other factors, the compiler may output ES5 code printing either result; this change will make it always obey the strict-mode behavior and print '1'.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Roll forward

*** Original change description ***

Automated g4 rollback of changelist 179255046.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Breaks transpilation.

*** Original change description ***

Normalize shorthand object properties.

After this change, the AST no longer has special forms for shorthand object properties (i.e. {x}), neither in object literals nor in object destructuring patterns.  Import specs are unchanged.

All handling of shorthand properties has been pushed to the extremities of parsing (which returns the same AST as {x:x}, except the STRING_KEY node has an IS_SHORTHAND_PROPERTY annotation) and code generation (which will re-collapse the property if the annotation is present and the names are the same).

This greatly simplifies a number of checks, transpilations, and optimizations, which now no longer need to deal with a different form of tree.

A number of NTI data types violated this contract, which can cause very confusing problems.

Because the string replacements fail to take their surroundings into consideration, it was previously omitting parentheses, e.g., by replacing `1 + equals(x, y)` with `1 + x == y`, which has a different meaning.  This change is slightly conservative, and has the potential to add more parentheses than necessary (e.g., `1 + add(x, y)` will change to `1 + (x + y)`), rather than fiddling with details of associativity.

 - fixed bad code, when a symbol definition had a HOOK or other nontrvial

 - fixes regressions where parameters were not optimized if the symbol was used in a typeof/instanceof expression
 - reverts improvement to constructor optimizations when caused breakage when function constructor properties were used to invoke constructors (until we can decide to ban them or similar).

Improve the compile time cost for Optimize Calls from #1 to #17 (roughly 25% of its previous time).

This is handled correctly.

If ns is not defined at all, VarCheck complains, so we don't need to handle that case.

If ns and ns.Foo.Bar are defined, but not ns.Foo, then OTI registers the type ns.Foo.Bar, and also complains about the missing property ns.Foo. This seems like a rare case, so for now NTI won't match the OTI behavior; we don't register ns.Foo.Bar. If it turns out that it's a widespread use, we can revisit.

This stops Normalize from splitting export default + a function/class declarations with since default exports are unnamed.

It also stops rewriting of

Also changes the behavior of some NodeUtil helpers and unit tests to acknowledge that export default can contain module-level function and class declarations, which is both technically correct and should aid future work on export statements.

Direct calls require access to a FailureStrategy instance, and we're hiding those instances.

Additionally, in this particular CL, call check().about(...) instead of directly calling a Subject constructor with THROW_ASSERTION_ERROR.
Avoiding the Subject constructor is good for the reasons described above. But switching specifically to check().about(...) rather than assertAbout(...) also means that, if someone uses the Subject with a different failure strategy, we'll correctly propagate that strategy to derived subjects, rather than switch back to THROW_ASSERTION_ERROR.

I know that this CL adds a lot of boilerplate. If it's any consolation:
- We plan for check() to automatically add context in the future, so you'll get some value from it.
- We plan to convert SubjectFactory to an interface, so we'll come back and convert these all to ""public static SubjectFactory<FooSubject> foos() { return FooSubject::new; }.""

When there is a deep class hierarchy, even the clinits are empty, we can only remove one clinit at each pass.
This makes the number of optimization loops to be at least same as the level of depth of class hierarchy and each loop is quite expensive since a lot of passes not looking at only changed code.

This patch updates clinit pruning pass to be more aggressive and remove clinits/references to a fixed-point in single pass. As a result we can remove  whole empty chain in the class hierarchy in single pass instead of relying on other passess to cleanup to be able to do more removals.

There are two test cases that still fail in NTI.  It seems when 'window' is not explicitly declared in externs, then NTI does not recognize types declared on it.  It's actually more surprising that OTI *does* recognize these types, since the pass seems like it should be a no-op in this case.

Today following code:

const Bar = goog.require(""tests.Bar"");
const {doBaz} = goog.require(""tests.baz"");

gets rewritten to

const module$contents$tests$usage_Bar = goog.require(""tests.Bar"");
const {doBaz: doBaz} = goog.require(""tests.baz"");

doBaz becomes a global variable. So if doBaz is used in other goog.module they all will be indexed as one symbol. This messes up index.

This CL changes rewriting logic to produce following:

const module$contents$tests$usage_Bar = goog.require(""tests.Bar"");
const {doBaz: module$contents$usage_doBaz} = goog.require(""tests.baz"");

For some tools that ignore parse errors it is useful to parse code assuming code is ""strict"", but retain octal numbers.  So, when we report a parse error for octal numbers go ahead a produce the octal value as if there were not a parse error.

This also allows us to switch the NodeUtilTest to run using the default language mode.

Today following code:

const Bar = goog.require(""tests.Bar"");
const {doBaz} = goog.require(""tests.baz"");

gets rewritten to

const module$contents$tests$usage_Bar = goog.require(""tests.Bar"");
const {doBaz: doBaz} = goog.require(""tests.baz"");

doBaz becomes a global variable. So if doBaz is used in other goog.module they all will be indexed as one symbol. This messes up index.

This CL changes rewriting logic to produce following:

const module$contents$tests$usage_Bar = goog.require(""tests.Bar"");
const {doBaz: module$contents$usage_doBaz} = goog.require(""tests.baz"");

There were a number of changes that needed to happen to TypeInvalidator for this to work, since disambiguation has rather significantly different criteria compared to ambiguation and inlining.  Additionally, the disambiguate pass has some warning rate-limiting logic shoe-horned into it, which needed to instead be added to InvalidatingTypes.  I hope to simplify some of this logic (and, in particular, the way nodes and errors are stored in TypeMismatch objects) in a future change.

For object literals:
Previously we used the span of the entire function for the STRING_KEY for a
function's name when it was a method def in an object literal. For example, in
'var foo = { f2() {}};', the span for f2 would be 'f2() {}'. With this change,
the span for the name will just be 'f2'.

For goog.defineClass:
We would use the root of the property as the truth for
source location information during the rewrite of the property name. When you
used foo: function()... syntax, this would work because the root is a STRING_KEY
for foo. However, if you used foo() {} syntax the root would still be the
MEMBER_FUNCTION_DEF, which has a span covering the whole function. In the
MEMBER_FUNCTION_DEF case, we actually want to use the first-first child (a NAME
node) for the source location information.

Includes some minor changes to the semantics.  In particular, there's no reason to keep a class' subtypes separate form an interface's direct implementors: NTI does not make this distinction, and no callers distinguish (rather, they just end up asking for both).  So #getDirectImplementors has been folded into #getSubTypes.  Additionally, it no longer ever returns null: an empty list is returned instead, making it more ergonomic to use.

Many of the errors were about constant-named fields that aren't actually constant.  I opted to just suppress these warnings, rather than rename them, since they do behave like constants, and they should be consistent across different files.

It might be nice to fix these someday down the road, though it's not clear what the best approach would be.  Simply adding ""commonTypes."" isn't too terrible, particularly for any that are only used once or twice; for more frequently-used types, a getter and/or query method might be more appropriate.

Alternatively, if we could (a) eliminate the `inCompatibilityMode` flag to JSTypes, and (b) make the rest of the fields constant, it would be possible to make these types actually static constants.  The second part might be difficult, since the properties of many of these types *do* depend on externs, which may change from compilation to compilation.  These would take a lot more work to factor out: we'd need to figure out how to remove the reference to JSTypes in the really-constant versions, or else have an extra instance of it with only a subset of types (provided this doesn't cause any problems).

It's acceptable to reference 'this' from within a function that is within an ES6 constructor before calling the super(). It will only be a runtime error if the function is called before the super() has returned. However, the JS cannot prove this, nor can it prove that 'this' is not bound to something entirely different. Therefore it should backoff in these cases.

This also uncovered a bug where the pass would accept the super() call from a nested class as the super() call for the enclosing class, this has also been fixed.

In performing this migration, a number of bugs on OTI's typed code printing surfaced (primarily around nullability), so I fixed them and added a few regression tests.

One omission was leaving out the `@this` annotation from functions.  Fixing this unfortunately introduces a few redundant `@this` annotations where they shouldn't be necessary (we currently do a bit of work to try to eliminate these, but it depends on type information in the AST which isn't always available - see a few test cases that have been changed; potentially it's not worth doing this at all and we could eliminate the extra logic and simply always emit `@this`).

A number of new TypeI methods were required to support this.

This CL improves the check in two situations:

1. If goog.dom.TagName is aliased, e.g.:

const TagName = goog.require('goog.dom.TagName');
goog.dom.createDom(TagName.SCRIPT);

2. If the tag name is not used as a literal, e.g.:

var tag = goog.dom.TagName.SCRIPT;
goog.dom.createDom(tag);

This second situation is not very common but this CL prepares the ground for addressing this pattern which occurs in real code:

var tag = foo ? goog.dom.TagName.LABEL : goog.dom.TagName.SPAN;

This change fixes a bug in CrossModuleCodeMotion that could potentially have a
big impact on how code is moved across modules.

When a reference looks like this
`x instanceof Foo`

CrossModuleCodeMotion changes it to this:
`'undefined' != typeof Foo && x instanceof Foo`

Once that is done, it is safe to ignore the reference when deciding where to
move Foo.

This change is to ensure that CrossModuleCodeMotion
ignores the added `'undefined' != typeof Foo` references when it is run
repeatedly.

It relies on a definition finder instance as an index within which to find
parameters to change/remove. But it was not updating the index to match
ongoing AST changes which sometimes lead to the index containing references
to already-removed nodes and this lead the duplicative attempts to remove
them and report the associated change.

The pass was making a cursory attempt to mitigate this by collecting all the
removed nodes into a list and then updating the index at the end, but it was
possible for the duplicate removal attempts to occur between the original
removal and before the late index update.

I changed the index updates to each occur immediately after each node
removal.

RemoveUnusedVars was sometimes removing references inside of subtrees that
were already removed. Correct this in an elegant way is very difficult
because the different removals are tracked in different datastructures,
some of which are difficult to update for nodes in subtress and others of
which don't track the full set of node types.

I had a larger, less hacky and slower solution. But it didn't always work
since defFinder doesn't track GET_ELEM nodes and the other tracking
datastructures do.

all or nothing validation works correctly). Several issues:
* There was a logic mismatch with regard to which Nodes should be checked and
SCRIPT nodes were being ignored.
* The validation was only run if the PhaseOptimizer set but CompilerTestCase
does use PhaseOptimizer by default (some all but a few don't)
* The validation was comparing the state before the setup passes ran (es6
transpilation, normalization, etc) so a unit test might pass even if it didn't
mark a pass as changed.
* The validate logic, in unit tests, was not checking scopes not marked as changed but only
 validated that marked nodes had been changed (the latter is less likely to be
 incorrect).
* The validation logic was ignoring Node annotations when comparing node for
changes which causes some false negative results.

In addition to the validation logic fixes, this simplifies the Compiler/PhaseOptimizer interaction with regard to change tracking and makes way for future changes.

The validation is now turned off by default.  The next
change will turn it on by default with appropriate fixes.

 - Removed externs for HttpPromise.success and HttpPromise.error, which are removed in 1.6
- angular-.1.6-resource:
 - Fix externs so that types are not declared on typedefs, which is not supported by JSCompiler.
- angular-1.6.js
 - Remove most @typdef in favor of @record for better typechecking.
 - Remove dots before template parameter (e.g. Array.<string> => Array<string>)
 - Re-organize a few externs, so they are not used before being declared
 - Fix externs so that types are not declared on typedefs, which is not supported by JSCompiler

Outstanding Issues:

JSCompiler doesn't support properties declared on functions. These are moved out to their own file, so that the rest of the externs can be successfully type-checked.

For ArrowType:
The previous version simply summed all the parameter hashcodes, but since + is commutative this means that function(a,b){} and function(b,a){} would have the same hashCode.

Also it included the 'returnTypeInferred' field in the hashCode though it was not part of equals().  This has been fixed.

For FunctionType:
All functions with the same ArrowType would get the same hashcode.  To resolve this we instead just hash more data.

Doing this revealed a bug in the equals() method for FunctionType where it was assymmetric and allowed constructors to be equal to ordinary functions in some circumstances.  This has been also been fixed.

*** Reason for rollback ***

breaks jdossier because it introduces a binary incompatibility and jdossier is built against one version of rhino and runs against head... which is sad and should be fixed

*** Original change description ***

Change UnionType to hold a List instead of a Collection for the alternates and switch most accessors to do indexed iteration.

heap profiling showed that the iteration in JsType.checkEquivalenceHelper was allocating lots of iterators. This is an easy, if slightly annoying, way to make these operations a little cheaper.

The way this was implemented recursively it would cause one StringBuilder to
be instantiated for each level of a qualified name so

a.b.c.d

would allocate 3 StringBuilders and the string 'a' would get copied 6 times.
(once into the string builder and once calling toString on the builder) With
this change we will allocate exactly one StringBuilder and copy 'a' exactly 2
times (no matter how many levels of qualification there are).  This should be
faster and produce much less garbage.

This is good both because it makes CollapseProperties more focused and because
it makes the aggressively inlined AST state available to other optimization
passes that want to be able to assume such an AST state as input.

In the past some passes (like J2clPropertyInliner) assumed that aliases would be
inlined before they saw the AST, and when this was not true the solution was to
tell users that it was their responsibility to mark type alias vars @const so
that the InlineAliases pass would handle them. But it is no longer the desire of
JSCompiler team to require this of users, which makes the change (being performed
in this CL) a necessity.

This prevents renaming of the `exclusive` property in ADVANCED

Example code:
```javascript

		fs.root.getFile('some.file', {create:true, exclusive:true},

In ADVANCED compilation mode the `{create:true, exclusive:true}` object
is compiled to `{create:!0,a:!0}`.

Spec says it should be named `Flags` but I think that's too common name
so I went MDN's way with `FileSystemFlags`.

As a @constructor, user code which calls Geolocation methods generates a warning. Since there is no user-callable constructor, this needs to be a @record in order to allow an Object with the given properties to be treated as valid.

Additionally, the three properties are supposed to be optional, so their types now allow undefined. (Should they allow null too?)
From the spec (https://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html#position_options_interface):

> In ECMAScript, the enableHighAccuracy, timeout and maximumAge properties are all optional: when creating a PositionOptions object, the developer may specify any of these properties.

Also made position of type annotations consistent (on request).

*** Reason for rollback ***

Looks like some clients are relying on the old ordering. They should be ported to be ordering-independent before rolling forward.

*** Original change description ***

Adds the --create_externs_from_exports flag, which allows the creation of externs from exported methods.

Also fixes a minor bug in AbstractCommandLineRunner that prevented the use of that flag with relative paths containing no separators.

Finally, changes the way generated externs are sorted so that they respect dependency order. Alphabetical sorting is still used, but only within a script. This is important for the generated externs of a large project to be used directly without editing.

Fix...

Fix enum type references in generated externs

When a generated extern referenced an enum type in a parameter or
record type, the primitive underlying the enum was being used instead
of the enum itself.  For example, this code:

  /** @enum {number} */
  var E = { A: 1, B: 2 };
  /**
   * @param {function(E)} takesEnum
   * @param {E} e
   */
  function f(takesEnum, e) {
    takesEnum(e);
  }

Would become this in the generated externs for the library:

  /** @enum {number} */
  var E = { A: 1,...

This change ensures that the enum name itself is used when referencing
the enum.  The primitive type under the enum is only used in the enum
declaration.

However, this:

This allows users to easily map from generated source that's an
input to the compiler back into their original source files.

E.g. when compiling TypeScript, users would have:
    input.ts -(a)-> input.js -(b)-> compiled.js

Where (a) is the TypeScript compilation operation, and (b) is Closure
Compiler. With this option set, the source map generated in (a) is
applied to the operation (b), with the final source map mapping back
into `input.ts` from locations in `compiled.js`.

This also introduces an interface `SourceFileMapping` to avoid
increasing the coupling and responsibility of the Compiler object.

This reduces 'checkTypes' time in the J2CL 'timing' readable example
(which uses Guava) from 24.5 seconds to 1.7 seconds.

For future reference, note that when performing subtype analysis
JSCompiler sometimes incidentally calls
TemplateTypeMap.getResolvedTemplateType(). With that out of the way we
continue:

It just so happens that the TemplateTypeMap datastructure allows its
contained list of template keys and the list of template values to
have different lengths. When responding to getResolvedTemplateType()
requests it wants to correct this length mismatch (by duplicating the
map and filling in the missing template values slots with UNKNOWN_TYPE)
so that arbitrary index accesses will be safe.

But the act of duplicating a TemplateTypeMap and inserting UNKNOWN_TYPE
triggers new (and also expensive) type comparisons.

If the types being dealt with are nested templatized types, the result is
a super-linear explosion of back and forth cross talk between the acts of
subtype checking and TemplateTypeMap duplicating + UNKNOWN_TYPE padding.

The simple fix is to make arbitrary index access in
getResolvedTemplateType() safe not by duplicating and padding with
UNKNOWN_TYPE but to instead directly return UNKNOWN_TYPE if the index is
past the bounds of the template values list.

Building a version of jscomp that shares a JVM with closure-templates and other
closure tools would be easier if we could eliminate some dependency mismatches.

There are two issues that I try to address here
1. The guava dependency is a SNAPSHOT dependency, and compiling against it
   links to new Preconditions.check* method that do not exist in stable builds
   even though the 19.x/20.x-SNAPSHOT are source compatible.
2. Closure templates requires protobuf-java:3.x.

This does not change the versions of any dependencies.
It simply moves the versions for protobuf-java and guava into a
<dependencyManagement> section in the parent POM, and introduces
properties to specify them.

I can then build a soy+csscomp compatible jscomp thus

Since RefasterJS uses the same compiler object as whatever compilation unit it is refactoring, any type that is used by RefasterJS templates must already be known by that compilation unit or RefasterJS must not match against any code in that compilation unit. This previously didn't work because the template types were being treated as unknown, thereby loosely matching a lot of code.

This is done by making the ""previous"" node list circular, so that ""first.previous"" returns the same value as ""last"".

Here the ""next"" list is left as a simple list terminating with a null.  Originally, I attempted to use also make this circular (as the symmetry with the previous list was appealing).  However, this change ""getNext"" from a simple property retrieval to a conditional and this function is hot enough that it caused a compile time performance regression.  In this version ""getNext"" remains unchanged and no performance impact was measurable.

This has the following coding implications:
- in the Node class ""previous"" and ""getPrevious()"" no longer produce the same value
- it is no longer possible to call ""getPrevious"" on a detached Node as the ""first"" child of the parent must be known.
- removeChildren() returns a circular list
- ""Children"" and ""Child"" methods can no longer be used interchangeably for a single detached Node
- it is no longer possible to add a ""tail"" portion of a detached list

This change has the following benefits:
- the correct Child/Children methods must be called for the node structure

Previously we monkey-patched them to try to fix Symbol so that Object.keys and Object.getOwnPropertyNames would not return polyfilled symbols, nor would they return the hidden WeakMap property.  In practice, as long as Symbols show up in exacly one of getOwnPropertyNames and getOwnPropertySymbols, we're probably okay.  Given that the guerrilla patches (a) add a lot more code, and (b) increase complexity and brittleness significantly, it's probably best to not do it here.

Previously we polyfilled it with a method that always threw or returned false.

If a goog.module has exports of the form `exports = name` then we can create fewer aliases by replacing the definition of `name` throughout the module with the synthesized module export name, rather than synthesizing both a module-local and an export name.
So for example, instead of transpiling:

    goog.module('a.b.c');
    class Foo {}
    exports = Foo

to:

    class module$contents$a$b$c_Foo {}
    /** @const */ var module$exports$a$b$c = module$contents$a$b$c_Foo;

we can transpile to the even simpler:

    class module$exports$a$b$c {}

The intention is to use this to deprecate/remove the inlineAliases pass.

1. setUp() should always call super.setUp() & declare 'throws Exception'
2. Don't call setUp() from any method. Provide a method to explicitly create a
   fresh compiler instead.
4. Rename 'getOptions()' to 'getDefaultOptions()' to make it clearer that it doesn't
   just fetch the options object out of the compiler.
2. Make it easy to modify compiler options for individual test cases.
3. Make ""passes"" a local variable.

This can be done separately from the library polyfills since they are injected via a different mechanism.

One upshot of this is that using ES6 language features will no longer pull in the entire polyfill library.

Most isSubtype functions just pass the flag around. The interesting places are:
- In union types, we ignore null and undefined
- In generics, we ignore null and undefined when checking for invariance

This CL only makes the changes in the type checker. It changes TypeValidator only in a single place, to allow testing the new subtyping relation. In follow-up CLs, we will funnel more TypeValidator and TypeCheck warnings through this mode, and enable the mode on a per-file basis.

Previously the polyfills were written in ES6 and transpiled down to ES5 (and concatenated) into es6_runtime.js during the compiler's build, which requires us to check in generated code into our repository.  In order to eliminate this pre-compilation step (and use the separate files directly), we need to manually bring everything down to ES5, since the libraries are injected part-way through transpilation, so if a library is injected later that requires an earlier pre-processing, we'd have a bad time.  It might be possible in the future to move back to ES6 but we'd need to take care to ensure the injected libraries get the full transpilation treatment, and it's not clear that there would be any benefit since the whole point of these polyfills is that the browser *doesn't* support ES6, so they're only used when language_out < ES6.

  a. A Object.defineProperty(...) where an aliased property name is being

  def.
  b. A Object.defineProperties where the last param is not an object literal.

To ensure safety, a property being defined with an aliased descriptor now just
blacklists that property name.

Finally, a new diagnostic error is introduced to report when there is a
pattern that triggers a critical deoptimization.

Some fields in Java are not compile time constants but eventually become assigned by a constant value after JsCompiler optimizations (e.g. System.getProperty calls and other operations that are statically evaluate-able).
As such fields are not compile time constants, they are both assigned in module scope as part of class declaration and also inside $clinit for initialization. As a result, JsCompiler refuses to inline and statically evaluate expressions that refers to field because it doesn't know when it will get initialized.

Technically, this is correct behavior since there are no guarantees that the initial value will be visible by others or not. However, such value is only visible in Java if there is a cycle in clinits and the field is accessed before initialization. That is almost always a bug and GWT never assumed this state is observable in its optimizations, yet nobody complained. Hence we consider it is safe to upgrade such field to a constant and make it inline-able as GWT does.

But with goog.module it might be a problem because some symbols start with module$exports and some with actual module name. This cl fixes ordering by putting all module$exports symbols before all other symbols.

This bug affects only modules that start with ""n"" and later. Everything before ""m"" should not be affected.

Currently this is only done when there isn't any unconsumed comments. For those following along there are three steps to the parsing:

(1) parse
(2) convert to the internal AST
(3) validate

Step 1 already handled long chains of binary operators (the parser doesn't recurse for operators of the same precedence)
Step 2 we now handle by looping rather than recursion, but to avoid complexity only if there isn't any pending comments (JSDoc processing can be skipped).
Step 3 we handle with a simple loop and a work queue as it is a readonly traversal.

Currently the GWT compiler simply hardcodes the empty string for JVM properties, but this leads to the parser's ""unknown annotations"" list being parsed as a singleton list containing only the empty string, which is bogus.  The upshot is that a particular angular.js file has some JSDoc with a CSS example containing ""@-webkit"" which gets parsed as an empty annotation and breaks rhino's source position information, causing an unchecked exception and crashing the parser.  This change fixes it in two different places: (1) we no longer add the empty string as a valid annotation name, and (2) even if an empty-named annotation is found by the JsDocInfoParser, it is considered invalid.  It also adds better debugging to the exception thrown by SourcePosition, which previously omitted the line number (which turned out to be very important in tracking down the issue).

This pass is not control-flow optimized so for example a clinit that exists in both true-false conditional blocks will not cause any later clinits to be removed. However a clinit called before the control block will still prune the ones inside the control block.

Also simplifies current empty clinit pruner and enables the upcoming changes (e.g.'constant hoisting from clinits') since the clinits are simplified (no duplicates or self calls).

require.ensure is defined by the CommonJS spec: http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/Async/A. It is implemented by the InjectJS module loader and is also used by WebPack to support async loading of CommonJS modules.

It's a key component to allowing CommonJS modules to work in a browser uncompiled.

After compilation, it serves no use as the modules are all bundled. This removes the calls to require.ensure during module rewriting.

IE goog.module(""foo.bar.Outer.Inner""); before goog.module(""foo.bar.Outer"");

Some of the major implementation points:
- instead of creating a goog.scope() rename every top level name in a module with a module$contents$Foo_ prefix to guarrantee uniqueness
- for goog.module()s rename the exports object to module$exports$Foo for global uniqueness
- rewrite all goog.require()s that reference a goog.module() (even inside of legacy scripts) to pull in the relevant module$exports$Foo object.
- inline all type aliases (both from goog.require()s and goog.forwardDeclare()s) in goog.module() files because goog.scope() did this and other passes have come to depend on it
- if a goog.module() declares legacy namespace add a ""foo.Bar = module$exports$foo$Bar;"" binary name to legacy name bridge at the end so that legacy goog.require()s resolve
- for every legacy script add a ""var module$exports$foo$Bar = foo.Bar;"" legacy name to binary name bridge at the end so that all goog.require() statements inside of goog.module() files can be desugared with the assumption that there is a binary name out there for it to reference
- replace JsDoc type names in the entire program to turn fully qualified type names that reference types in goog.module() files into resolvable ""module$contents$Foo"" references, as well as to account for type alias inlining in goog.module() file.

Instead of using loose matching, which can result in post-refactoring code that
does not type-check, use a strict type matching that matches only the exact
type specified in the template, or proper subtypes thereof.

To allow refactoring of code that does not quite match types as needed in the
after-template, as well as un-typed code, this CL changes RefasterJS to attempt
template matches strictly in the order in which the before-templates appear in
the template file.

This allows multiple before-templates of a given pattern to be specified with
successively more loose type matching, and appropriate after-templates.

See examples/navigational_xss_sinks.js for an extensive example.

Fix class name not properly scoped to CLASS

We need to treat CLASS as a root for a block scope possibly
containing just the ""class name"" declaration.

See ""classScope"" in:
http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-runtime-semantics-classdefinitionevaluation

Add a few unit tests regarding class names and function names.

Note that our transpilation doesn't support referring to the class name
in a method body yet. Eg:

var Clazz = class Foo {
  bar() {
    return new Foo;
  }
};

is currently transpiled to:

/**@constructor @struct */var Clazz = function() {
};
Clazz.prototype.bar = function() {
  return new Foo;
};

which does not work at runtime. This will be fixed later.

Part of the fix to #1546.

Closes #1551

Add GwtRunner, the GWT equivalent of CommandlineRunner

Changed JsComp.gwt.xml to use the SingleScriptLinker so that the GWT
compiler only outputs a single JavaScript file (jscomp.nocache.js).

Changed JsCompGwtMain to GwtRunner with ""JSCompiler"" exported as the
JavaScript name through JsInterop. Currently, GwtRunner supports a
limited set of compiler flags, including compilationLevel,
warningLevel, languageIn and languageOut among others.

To use the GWT version of the compiler, do a Maven build and include
""jscomp.nocache.js"" from
target/closure-compiler-gwt-1.0-SNAPSHOT/jscomp/, Eg.:

<script src=""jscomp.nocache.js""></script>
<script>
  var output = new JSCompiler().compile(""var x;"", {
      compilationLevel: 'ADVANCED',
      warningLevel: 'VERBOSE',
      languageIn: 'ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT',
      languageOut: 'ECMASCRIPT3'
  });
  console.log(output);
</script>

Note that GwtRunner doesn't automatically load the default externs yet,
so for now you need to manually provide the needed externs for ES6.

As an aside, the Maven build for closure-compiler-gwt is much faster
now that I removed most dependencies to gwt-user.jar.

Adding a goog.require wouldn't be a way of fixing these cases anyway.

This is particularly important as we switch to code using modules.
e.g. It doesn't make sense to ask for a require of FooBar.Subclass
for the following code:
    function FooBar() {};
    FooBar.Subclass = makeConstructor();
    new FooBar.Subclass();

Simplify !IArrayLike|!Array to !IArrayLike in ES6 Array polyfills

After 9d52fed2c7da2a9e3807477c852c60b56edd2497, Array implements
IArrayLike, so the union type can be simplified.

Contribution from @Dominator008

Closes #1530
-------------

Disambiguate: Backoff for properties of @records defined in externs.

For external code, the usage of an @record type by a matching class may
in code not visible to the compiler, so for now just skip disambiguation
for all properties of @record in externs to be safe.
-------------

Add type annotations for chrome.wallpaper API.
https://developer.chrome.com/apps/wallpaper

We will use that API at Files app (Chrome OS File Manager).

*** Reason for rollback ***

Breaks obfuscation due to an issue with @record.

*** Original change description ***

Fix the Angular externs.

- Convert angular objects from @typedef to @interface.
 - angular.$filterProvider
 - angular.$http.Config
 - angular.$http.Interceptor
 - angular.$provider
- Move angular.$provider up in the file, so that it is not referenced before being defined.
- @constructor => @interface, when possible--Angular provided objects cannot be 'new-ed', and users should not reference internal Angular methods.
- Remove the '.' after Array/Object and the template type.

Check for useless blocks. A block is considered useful if it is part of a
control structure like if / else / while / switch / etc. or if it contains
any block-scoped variables (let, const, class, or function declarations).
Otherwise there is no reason to use it so it is likely a mistake. This would
catch the classic error:

return
    {foo: 'bar'};

or more contrived cases like:

if (denied) {
  showAccessDenied();
} {
  grantAccess();

The bug has a number of facets to it.
  * The source js file declares a parameter type of {?function(...T)}, but in
  fact that isn't really accurate. It's more of a function that takes an
  arbitrary number of arbitrary types, notof one type.
  * The tooling that auto generates the externs file incorrectly turns the
  above (wrong though I think it is) into {?function(?)}, so now we can't use
  the API when passing in a handler that takes more than one parameter (as the
  one for the ""set_at"" event does.

When the receiver has an optional property and accesses it, we currently give two warnings, one for possibly-inexistent property and one because the context usually expects a type that doesn't include undefined. No point in giving two, we should warn only for the 2nd thing, and the programmer can check for undefined if they want. The 1st warning is also bad because they can't cast to a sensible type to avoid it, only to ?.

For unions of objects, we still give the possibly-inexistent-property warning. For those, the type doesn't include undefined when accessing the property.

Int casts in Java will truncate a long value and consequently may alter the sign of the value being cast. Compare methods may be implemented using a subtract, iff values are known not to be near overflowing limits. When the values are longs you can get:

int compare(MyLongHolder other) {
  return (int)(other.x - x);
}

As the cast won?t preserve the sign of the subtract it is buggy and can lead to broken sort orders.

then do checks/optimizations, and then convert to ES6, where possible.

The code currently does:

(0,eval(""...""));

which is a ""direct eval call"" (See http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_10.4.2
for details). I believe the intention was do an indirect call to get a global eval:

(0,eval)(""..."");

Since we weren't using a global eval before, it would be safer to just remove
the ""0,"" to maintain the same behavior, but I believe doing the indirect call
is the prefered solution, since it more directly simulates the list of <script>
tags.

For example if a function wrapper was added or a ""use strict"" was added to the
outer script, this wold cause these direct eval calls to have separate
execution contexts, and functions/variables could not be shared (in fact this
is probably why change cr/93455279 was done, the ""use strict"" broken because of
this eval bug).

Removed the confusing inFunction() method in NodeTraversal and added inGlobalHoistScope().

Given NodeTraversal t, prefer t.inGlobalHoistScope() over t.getClosestHoistScope().isGlobal() because the former never scans any scopes.

Prefer t.getEnclosingFunction() over NodeUtil.getEnclosingFunction(n) because the former scans less nodes in general.

Fixed ScopedAlias to not report extra error messages for legitimate declarations.

Fixed InlineFunctions not traversing function declarations in global block scopes, as shown in CommandLineRunnerTest.

Verified that these changes don't introduce code size regression after each pass.

The current SortDependencies.java implementation is a breadth first
graph traversal that does not support circular dependencies.

ES6 modules support circular dependencies and perform a depth first graph
traversal.

This change adds support for the ES6 modules style ordering and turns it
on when JSComp is in ES6+ language-in mode.

To minimize side effects and reuse testing the change was performed by
turning SortedDependencies.java into an interface and creating 2
implementers.

When converting ECMAScript 6 modules, don't add an extra namespace
declaration. The namespace will be declared through `goog.provide`. When
processing the `goog.provide`, the compiler will then add a JSDoc
`@const` tag to the namespace.

For example, instead of converting the following ES6 module:

```
// calculator.js
export function square(x) {
        return x * x;
}
```

to:

```
goog.provide(""module$calculator"");
function square$$module$calculator(x) {
  return x * x;
}
var module$calculator = {};
module$calculator.square = square$$module$calculator;
```

it will now be converted to:

```
goog.provide(""module$calculator"");
function square$$module$calculator(x) {
  return x * x;
}
module$calculator.square = square$$module$calculator;
```

which will later be converted to:

```
var /** @const */ module$calculator = {};
function square$$module$calculator(x) {
  return x * x;
}
module$calculator.square = square$$module$calculator;

Detects UMD pattern when processing JavaScript modules and rewrites it
to make sure the CommonJS ""module.exports"" or ""exports"" statements can
be reached. Checks the condition of an if-statement for an occurrence of
either ""module.exports""/""exports"" for CommonJS or ""define.amd"" for
AMD. For an if-statement that is checking for CommonJS, we pull out the
then-branch and remove the rest. For an if-statement that is checking
for AMD, we pull out the else-branch (since it could be checking for
CommonJS) and remove the rest.

For example:

var foobar = {
    foo: ""bar""
};

if (typeof define === ""function"" && define.amd) {
    define([], function() {
        return foobar;
    });

    if (true) {
        module.exports = foobar;

} else {
    this.foobar = foobar;

will be translated to:

    foobar$$module$umd_standard = {foo:""bar""},

required: (undefined|{defaultValue: (null|number|string|undefined), formId: string, id: string, label: (null|soydata.SanitizedHtml|string), ...})

This is not useful at all. I know that I can pass undefined but that's not the problem. The problem is that the object has a mismatch in some other properties that are omitted from the error message.

ProcessScope looks at scopes outer-to-inner, and we can't change this order without major changes (if at all). So, it's very common to see a constructor as the RHS of a @const assignment, without having seen all its class properties yet.

The reason we finalize a namespace is to convert it to a JSType. But when we compute the namespace type for the constructor, we care about the static properties (and the prototype properties), not the class properties (because the class properties are on the instances, not on the constructor). The class properties always live on RawNominalType.java, so we can keep adding them even if the raw type is contained in a JSType.

Decouple jsdoc documentation parsing from IDE mode.

Currently the parsing of JSDoc documentation is coupled to the IDE mode
option so normally JSDoc documentation strings are not parsed.  This
prevents the implementation of custom compiler passes like API Documentation
generation.  This patch introduces a new compiler option
(parseJsDocDocumentation) which can be used to enable the documentation
parsing even when not in IDE mode.  The functionality is backward
compatible, when IDE mode is enabled then documentation parsing is always
enabled)"

[NEW TYPE INFERENCE] Create pass that converts new types to old types after type inference.

This allows the type-aware compiler passes to work with NTI without being converted to TypeI. (Thus, conversion to TypeI can be done gradually). For this CL, I only looked at CheckAccessControls. In later CLs I will enable NTI on the unit tests of other type-aware passes.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Decrease the number of methods in TypeI and friends. We've recently decided to go about the migration of passes to NTI in a slightly different way.

[NEW TYPE INFERENCE] Convert CodingConvention and its subclasses to use TypeI.

The only classes from rhino.jstype left in coding conventions are JSTypeNative (which we are keeping), StaticScope and StaticSourceFile. We will eventually remove the last two also.

This change requires supporting some of TypeI in the new type inference.

This reduces the old-type-system usage in the rest of the compiler. CL/87658872 removed some uses of getTypedScopeCreator. The last method in Compiler is getTypeRegistry, which is used in many places, so it can't be removed.

- CheckAccessControls only uses getReadableJSTypeName. This method is in TypeValidator, but it only needs a registry, o/w it could be static. So, move it to registry.
- Ambiguate/Disambiguate/InlineProps only use the mismatches.

The built-in behavior of the compiler is to produce only the declared language_out source code. It does this with the primary CodeGenerator, as well as a subtype, TypedCodeGenerator, which additionally emits the declared types in JSDocs.

I would like to have my own subclass of CodeGenerator, to experiment with new language features for AtScript. In particular, I'm overriding the behavior of printing classes to emit an ""interface"" keyword rather than /** @interface */ class{}. I cannot do this in a CompilerPass because the syntax I'm generating is not valid ES6_TYPED and so it cannot be represented by the AST.

Context: the StaticSymbolTable interface is not used by the compiler. It is only used by the SymbolTable class, which creates a symbol table for the compiler's custom clients. By making StaticSymbolTable untyped, we allow the 4 classes that implement the interface to use either typed or untyped scopes. In the next CL, I will split Scope and Var into typed and untyped versions (the original goal), and change several classes in the compiler to use untyped scopes and vars.

*** Reason for rollback ***

This change starts an awful chain of consequences that leads to the current type system's distinction of declared and inferred record types.As is this causes some inferred record types to become declared record types.  It is unclear if it is time well spent to try to fix this. An alternate solution for goog.module is proposed.  However, that solution doesn't help ES6 modules or other module systems that naturally have a lot of type declaration aliases.  Native understanding of ES6 modules is, of course, the correct solution there.

*** Original change description ***

Improve type inferrence for goog.module exports (part 1 of 3):
Fix declaration of type aliases with inferred constants.

The jQuery AJAX setting dictionary is a defined dictionary with known fields. When the various methods accept such a dictionary, they expect very specific properties (the developer can indeed add more properties, of course). Adding a typedef for this type of dictionary reduces the need to quote properties.
Currently, $.ajax({url: ""/"", beforeSend: function (){} ,cache: true,username: ""d"",xhrFields: {}}) compiles to $.ajax({url:""/"",a:function(){},b:!0,c:""d"",d:{}}), causing errors.

With the use of the typedef in the various functions, $.ajax({url: ""/"", type: ""post""}) and friends will be minified without renaming the relevant properties, causing the code not to fail anymore."

*** Reason for rollback ***

Sometimes we do need to instantiateGenerics even when the type variable
to be substituted is ""bound"" by a nominal type.
See the added unit test.

Due to a couple more issues about the memoization in NominalType
and the mutation of the boundTypeVars parameter, I think it's easier
to just rollback for now and add back this perf optimization later
if needed.

*** Original change description ***

[NEW TYPE INFERENCE] Return early from instantiateGenerics when possible, to avoid creating new types.

Currently, the Google coding convention uses a source file's path as its package name. This is a problem for legacy directory layouts that place test files within test/ or testing/ subdirectories. (Closure places _test.js files in the same directory as source files, so it is unaffected.)

Currently, the default coding convention treats every source file as if it occupies a unique singleton package. If we added @package annotations to the Closure Library without changing this, compilation involving those parts of the library would fail. This CL makes the default coding convention use the source file's path as its package name, without the ""test"" exceptions of the Google coding convention.

While it's generally recommended to maintain externs together with the original
library, in the case of AngularJS this didn't really work: changes to the
externs are prone to break things, and we can only test those within Google.
There also seems to be little interest in maintenance of these outside of
Google, so most contributions come from inside and are much easier for users if
the source is maintained internally.

blickly,2013-08-15 23:08:10,https://api.github.com/repos/google/closure-compiler/git/commits/659c5484f5cb439436b44f38124adc1b24c80809,659c5484f5cb439436b44f38124adc1b24c80809,"Introduce an experimental option to use externs to export mutable properties and/or properties not on global names.

This differs from @expose in that it does not interfere with CollapseProperties or other optimizations that can ignore externs (generally, objects known not to escape) and pattern matching that doesn't expect GETELEM.

A finalized version of this combined with a @nocollapse annotation will allow us to remove @expose support.

Several simplification are made here:
1) only properties that would not otherwise have been legal to export are exportable using this new approach so this can't introduce problems for existing @export usage.
2) the properties are ""exported"" by creating synthetic properties on ""Object.prototype"".

Exporting on ""Object.prototype"" is not ideal as it prevents property disambiguation and thus renaming of the property globally, however it is sufficient to validate this approach. What should happen, once we have a mechanism for adding an synthetic interface declaration, is that each ""class"" would implement a specific ""exports"" interface just for that class.  Only object literal properties would be exported to Object.prototype.

Alternately, in an ES5 world these properties could be exported by introducing ES5 getters/setters for the properties to ""alias"" the name (this gets a little tricky as we would need to handle the case where the property is not actually renamed).

Since the ALL type may represent a non-function type, so it can't be gauranteed to be a callable expression. On the other hand, {?} is never type checked, and allows callers to cast the return value.

Maybe if AngularJS team does closer integration with Closure compiler in the future they can map these to concrete types :)

.get and .invoke return {*}, the ""ALL"" type. Unfortunately, the ALL type is still type checked, and apparently doesn't include functions.

The simplified scenario is:

goog.exportSymbol('id', id);

In the compiler's ExternExportsPass class, there's a definitionMap that maps symbols names to Nodes. In the node traversal, the id function is found but then later overwritten by the the local variable id in function foo.

So, clearly this is bad behavior.
