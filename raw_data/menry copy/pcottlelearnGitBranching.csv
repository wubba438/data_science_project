This project uses `contributor-faces`, it includes `gh-got`.

And `gh-got` require Node v8 so `travis-ci` will have the error.

- Or install `contributor-faces` in your machine(require Node >= 8) and sometime run `contributor-faces .` in your project to update list contributor."

Avoid stating that changing HEAD alters the working tree.  Although that
is a common next step they are not actually the same action and can be
done independently (e.g. `git reset` without `--hard`).

Also state that committing while on a branch only alters the branch,
without actually changing HEAD; HEAD only gets the new commit because it
points to the branch rather than a specific commit."

Change the order of parents of the final commit in the goal of the level

either order is accepted the new, consistent order of parents is the
more idiomatic one merging a bugFix into master rather than master into
bugFix. Actually producing the old goal would require more commands.

Even though ordering of parents is too advanced of a topic to be covered
this early, it would be nice to keep that consistent."

I noticed there's a typo in the 1.3 alert modal.  If you follow the
directions to the T, it won't pass because it commits to the wrong
branch.

It needs to say make a new branch called `bugFix`,
then `git checkout bugFix`, then commit.

Screenshot with commands in working order:

13 tests, 13 assertions, 0 failures
I couldn't get it to build to test the text displaying in browser, so
that still needs to be tested."
