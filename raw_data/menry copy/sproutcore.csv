store indicates it has fetched the query, the status will stay
READY_CLEAN and observers late to the chase (such as stateObservers)

jQuery fail to compute the correct offset when using $.position.
This is because, in SC, centered elements are positioned in percentage
like this: top: 50%; margin-top: -10px. And jQuery is subtracting the
margin from the offset which lead to a wrong value.
This commit fixe this and remove some hacky code in
positionOverTargetView which was related to this behaviour. This hack
were causing trouble when an SC.InlineTextFieldView were displayed from
an element positioned without percentage (like in SC.TableView)."

publickeating,2015-01-15 20:45:05,https://api.github.com/repos/sproutcore/sproutcore/git/commits/93e6a407e43fbd35c0674cf0973f9f75b08ef89f,93e6a407e43fbd35c0674cf0973f9f75b08ef89f,"After some investigation, it was found that there were a number of issues with the built-in gesture support. For example, two touch taps would throw an exception, pinches would fail to register and in particular, supporting multiple gestures failed in a number of scenarios. In order to fix these problems, the gesture code has been rewritten from the top-down.

It is now possible to mixin SC.Gesturable to a view and use events to react to multiple gestures concurrently. Examples of the advanced type of behavior that the gesture code allows include:

* Responding to single finger, two finger or any other number of touch taps, pinches (2+ touches) or swipes individually or as a group. For example, your code may want to perform different actions when a single finger taps vs. when there is a two finger tap.
* A touch session, the time between when the first touch begins and the last touch ends, may contain more than one gesture. For example, it's possible for the user to perform a pinch, then use a third finger to tap, then swipe the remaining fingers. For example, imagine using pinch to scale an image, tap to save the change and then swipe to move it aside all without lifting the fingers. At the least, the ability to perform gestures in a single touch session multiple times, makes the gesture recognition more robust against stray accidental touches.
* Swipe gestures can now be configured to match against any arbitrary angles, not just left, right, up & down.
* Swipe gestures no longer trigger by simply moving far enough in one direction. They must also move quickly (configurable) and end immediately."

This includes the existing polyfill for `window.requestAnimationFrame` and a brand new polyfill for `Object.keys`. The legacy framework is included by default by requiring `:sproutcore` in a project's or an app's Buildfile. The legacy framework itself requires the `:sproutcore/desktop` framework, which allows for any legacy code in the SproutCore controls to be separated out.

Therefore, to build an app that will only work with the newest browsers (probably not a great idea —), you may change your Buildfile requirements to include only the specific SproutCore sub-frameworks you need. For example,

    config :my_app, :required => [:""sproutcore/desktop"", :""sproutcore/datastore""]"

Because the `id` property is a computed property, once it has been read (i.e. `myNewRecord.get('id')`), it will remain cached for any further reads. This can become an issue in situations where the ID of the record changes after being saved to the server. For instance, a new record may be given a temporary ID when it is created and the temporary id may be accessed via `get`. After that record is saved to the server, a call to `store.dataSourceDidComplete(RecordType, newBody, newBody.id)` would properly update the `id` value in the store, but would fail to clear the record instance's cache of `id`. Therefore, a successive call to `get('id')` would return the old value."

The issue was that the callback functions were called on the parent before the child was updated to the proper new state. For example, if a developer set the visibility of a child view to false in `didCreateLayer`, at that point the child view would have still been in an unrendered state and optimizations preventing visibility changes to unrendered views would have meant the visibility change would have been lost.

Refactored the view statechart code significantly to improve the clarity of the state transition handling and fixes #1269."

It is often the case that a single property depends on two or more bound properties in a complex manner that isn't handled by the current `and` and `or` transforms. To handle this situation previously, the developer would need to write the code to bind in the external property values and then make a local computed property dependent on each of these.

Instead, these occurrences were converted to either access the arguments by index without a copy or to do a fast copy without instantiation. See http://jsperf.com/closure-with-arguments for an example of the performance difference this can make. Using slice is anywhere from ~50% to ~90% slower depending on the browser.

This allows calling-time specific information to be passed to the action + target on each call. To specify the `action` for `fireAction` to use, the existing `action` property should still be set. As part of this change, the documentation for SC.ActionSupport has been greatly extended and includes tips on supporting multiple actions or targets and for implementing actions on targets.

Along with this change, the `actionContext` property has also now been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of SproutCore.

Note: this is a backwards-compatible change. If a String is passed to `fireAction` *and* no `action` property exists, the argument will be used as the `action` (i.e. no context will be sent). When this occurs, a Developer Warning will appear in the console. Likewise, a Developer Warning will appear if `actionContext` is set prior to a view being initialized.
* SC.ButtonView and SC.CollectionView have both been altered slightly to use SC.ActionSupport. This has no affect on the use of action & target in these views."

SC.mixin and SC.supplement iterated the arguments object to insert a boolean flag to pass to a private function that then iterated its arguments in order to ignore the flag argument, which is totally unnecessary. Instead, SC.mixin and SC.supplement iterate the arguments once and pass the new Array to the private function as a second argument, removing the need for a second iteration.

As well, these three areas all accessed the arguments object to copy it, which requires the browser to instantiate it, which is costly. Instead, we now do a fast copy (similar to this: http://jsperf.com/closure-with-arguments) without instantiating the arguments object.

Finally, by doing a fast copy of arguments these functions are now optimizable by V8, whereas they weren't previously.

Certain containing views, transitions and specialized layout engines need to know what type of layout their child views will have in order to make the proper adjustments.

When a user clicks a mouse like the Apple Magic Mouse, they often involuntarily trigger a couple mousewheel events while pressing or lifting their finger. The result of this is that any scrolling views that act on the mousewheel event will move the content slightly (e.g. Ever notice how Google maps is basically unusable with an Apple Magic Mouse because every click zooms sporadically?). To prevent this, SC.CollectionView claims mousewheel events when it is also handling the mousedown event. As well, for a very brief moment after the mouse is released (and the user's finger is still traveling upward), the view continues to claim mousewheel events.

This change also refactors the mouseDown and mouseUp methods to have a single return (thus greatly reducing their complexity) and fixes an inconsistency in which `actOnSelect` only worked on mouse events when `useToggleSelection` and `selectOnMouseDown` were set (it now works when any mouse handling results in a ""select"")."

The previous polymorphic record support took care to ensure that the same store key was returned for all polymorphic classes by duplicating the store key to id mapping on each related polymorphic class. But where it failed was in situations where the store manipulated the store keys hashes directly (ex. replaceIdFor()), which would result in different store key to id mappings between polymorphic classes. Also, duplicating the mapping on each class was very wasteful and slow due to recursion. Instead, now the mapping is stored only once on the root polymorphic record and all subclasses simply reference it directly. This removes the duplicate memory use and removes the need to recurse each time that a new polymorphic record is added to the store."

SC.State had two `observes` helper functions used to be notified when its `enteredSubstates` and `currentSubstates` arrays change. Since these arrays are modified by the owner statechart, the observers needed to be chained enumerable observers. However, this resulted in slower object initialization for each state object and excess observer firing as the entered and current substates change. Instead, we simply notify the target state directly each time that the statechart makes a change to its `enteredSubstates` and `currentSubstates`.

Benchmarks:
  initStatechart in unit tests: ~21ms to ~13ms (~38% faster)
  initStatechart in large application: ~81ms to ~51ms (~37% faster)"

There were a couple of issues hampering performance for SC.PickerPanes within SC.ScrollViews. The first was that the scroll view observers were too greedy observing (the unfortunately noisy) horizontalScrollOffset and verticalScrollOffset of the scroll view for changes and repositioning on each change. What this meant was that an SC.PickerPane could reposition itself up to 6 times in a single run loop as the content of the scroll view changed even thought the scroll offsets may not have changed at all. Instead, the proper pattern for observing multiple properties (or noisy properties) is to filter the input through an invokeX (i.e. so even though 6 calls to the observer function occur, we only call positionPane once, via invokeOnce). Additionally, we no longer observe the offsets if the scroll view can't even scroll (in either direction). And finally, to ensure that the anchor element is in its new position before we re-position, we actually use invokeNext as our input filter."

The pane listened to changes to its borderFrame in order to know whether to reposition itself or not. This means that changes to its size (width/height) allowed it to reposition to best fit, but because repositioning ends up changing the same borderFrame, it meant one (potentially dangerous) extra call through positionPane for no reason. Instead, we use viewDidResize, which only gets called on size (width/height) changes."

Previously, there were 3 ways to display the hint: via placeholder attribute, via a text overlay or via setting an initial value of the input field. The last way, setting the value of the input, is the oldest method and the least useful, because it requires a lot of extra work to modify the type of the input when it is a password field into a text field. This work is made even worse because Internet Explorer doesn't allow you to modify the type of the field and so the code gets quite ugly and has been the source of a lot of bugs.

But the second approach, using a text overlay, can do all of this with much simpler code and therefore we've removed the legacy approach for a two method approach: 1) use the placeholder when possible, unless hintOnFocus is true, or else 2) use a text overlay."

Since the thumb portion of the scroller is translated and since it is not an SC.View, we can’t call .animate on it directly and calling .animate on the actual parent node’s SC.View fails to work too.

Also, changes the fade out implementation slightly to only call fadeIn/fadeOut once on the ScrollView per change, which speeds things up a lot and saves the ScrollView implmentation from having to track state. Also ensures that the scrollviews don’t only fade out on append, but also fade back in on re-append or re-show.

Also, renames fadeDelay to fadeOutDelay to be more explicit on what the delay is (fade in vs. fade out) and removes fadeInDuration/fadeOutDuration, because the fade animation is strictly handled by the scroller."

      &.small { line-height: 24px; }
      &.large { line-height: 36px; }
    }

I found that almost every view in a design mode of the app needed small adjustments to their CSS for the current mode.  While it was possible to use classNameBindings on to the 'designMode' property, it ended up being used on almost every child view which meant a lot of repeated typing, plus classNameBindings would have resulted in an additional observer on each child view.

While a design may be flexible for a wide range of display widths, at a certain point it no longer makes sense to keep stretching or compressing views and instead it is better to completely alter the design.  A prime example is that a design that can flex between a medium sized display like a tablet and a large sized display like a desktop, will not likely work for a small display like a smartphone.  In order to very easily alter the design, SC.Pane provides the designModes property which includes the width thresholds that you want to trigger a change to the overall design of the application.  Each time a threshold width is crossed, the child views will be updated with the new design mode.  At this point, any properties dependent on 'designMode' will recompute allowing you to adjust settings such as isVisible.

As well, SC.View has a new property 'designLayouts' that is simply the layouts for the 'designModes' you define.  For example, if the design mode becomes 'small' any child view that has a 'small' designLayout will have its layout automatically set.

This completes work spec #843."

One scenario that this has been seen in is an observer that destroys an old binding and creates a new binding to a *store query based computed property*.  As the binding is about to update, it first has to get the value of the query based computed property from the target, which results in the store flushing and indicating certain records did change which in turn triggers the original observer function where the binding is replaced.

Previously, the tree observer process was extremely inefficient. For one, the tree controller constantly destroyed and recreated item observer instances whenever its content changed. For another, the item observer observed all properties of its items so any property change (even those not associated with tree item content) would cause the item observer to check for changes to the item’s expanded state or children.

For example, in a current app with a one level deep tree of tree branches, the old code created 25 tree item observers and destroyed 21 for a total of 4 actual item observers. The new code simply creates 4 actual item observers one time!"

This code was essentially unreadable and did not even really work.  There were lots of odd constants that affected the positioning and placement in strange ways.  With this refactor, the picker pane properly positions itself on the most appropriate side and will slide itself up/down or left/right if it can in order to fit.

- adds ability for pointer to automatically adjust its position as the pane shifts left/right or up/down regardless of its size
- fixes pane positioning to take into account the borderFrame
- adds private `windowPadding` property that ensures pickers are positioned a certain amount of distance from all edges of the screen
- deprecates the extraRightOffset property since the pointer positions itself
- fixes bug with render delegate that left the position class on the view after it changed"

While you could previously use the `isEnabledInPane` property to determine if any ancestor view had been disabled, it was lazily computed and not bindable.  With this change, `isEnabledInPane` is updated actively, which means that it can be used to update the child view's display if wanted.  For example, a view gets the 'disabled' class if isEnabled is set to false, but it can also add isEnabledInPane as a displayProperty and use it to appear disabled if any ancestor becomes disabled.

This cascading can be blocked by any child view by setting `shouldInheritEnabled` to false, which allows you to set isEnabled on the top pane, but keep a section of child views separately enabled.

Includes unit tests.  Closes #638."

For example, this allows you to toggle canReorderContent to hide or show a drag handle on item views that have isReorderable as a display property.

2de01b5f0576a907 (which were welcome since besides fixing the z-index,
it also fix a problem where if an inline text field was in a scroll
view, the field wasn't moving when scrolling), the calculation of
position of the editor was completely wrong. This can be see in the
showcase, with the SC.LabelView and the SC.ListView examples.
Based on my app and the showcase app, this commit fix the problem. I
haven't added units test because I believe this can't be tested.

The code assumed that the first argument would normally be undefined, but because the function is an observer method, the first argument is always the target of the observer.  Therefore, the fast path conditional would always be false.

Also, this causes problems if developers use the theme's classNames and assume it will be an Array like with SC.View.

This is a potentially incompatible change, but it actually fixes current code that uses the theme's classNames with the updated SC.RenderContext API so it should potentially work with any current code.  Also, because this API is so under-used, hopefully it will not affect any implementations.  Though, if it does cause actual backwards incompatibility, it will have to be reverted for 1.10."

After struggling to make the container view handle multiple nowShowing changes while the previous items were still exiting, I had to step back and draw up the proper statechart for the container view to try and figure out why I couldn't get certain transitions to behave exactly as they should.  I determined that the container view's states are very basic, but what was missing was that each content view needed its own statechart in order to manage its own state.  For instance, a content view may be told to exit multiple times while it is in the process of exiting and the number of times it is told to exit may effect its transition.  Therefore, I added a simple statechart, SC.ContainerContentStatechart, that the container view can create for each new content and give control of the content's transitioning to.  This makes it possible to do very complex transitions, such as the PUSH transition that adjusts its exit animation accordingly to account for being pushed off before even being fully pushed on."

Previously, each SC.View created an SC.LayoutStyleCalculator object that it used in a truly dubious manner.  The LayoutStyleCalculator was supposed to be a group of functions that could be shared between all views, but instead each view had to create and modify its own instance of the calculator.  The calculator had several internal state variables which meant it could not be shared between views.  The calculator also cross-referenced the view itself and was never cleaned up resulting in a memory leak.

This update untangles the view from the calculator so that the calculator can be shared between views (not really much reason to even have this separate, but none-the-less…) and fixes the memory leak of SC.LayoutStyleCalculator instances."

- animate() uses invokeNext() so that the developer never needs to monkey with the run loop in order to call animate().  Animations will only begin after the browser has had a chance to flush any changes to the DOM, thus ensuring that the animation actually occurs.  This will make using .animate() much easier whereas previously, developers would revert to invokeLaters to try and make sure the DOM style existed before animate would adjust it.
- the animate() function can now accept a target argument as well as a method, which conforms to the standard used by many methods in SproutCore.
- if no target it given the view itself will be the value of `this` in the callback.  Previously, this would be the layoutStyleCalculator, an internal object of SC.View.
- the animate() function is thoroughly documented now, including notes on how to hardware accelerate position changes.
- uses new additions to SC.platform and SC.browser to make animations forward compatible and fixes animate() on Firefox nightly
- hardware accelerated styles no longer remain in the DOM after the animation completes (i.e. sometimes the translate values would stay in the style)
- resetAnimation() has been renamed to cancelAnimation(), because reset indicates 'revert', but the default behavior doesn't revert the layout.
- added SC.ANIMATION_POSITION constant for use by cancelAnimation().
- fixes hasAcceleratedLayer to be dependent on the layout.  Previously, adjusting a non-accelerated layout to an accelerate-able layout failed to update the property and hasAcceleratedLayer would be incorrect.
- cancelAnimation() can now cancel an animation and adjust the layout to its current value during the transition, to its original value or to the final value which is the default.
- adds a private `liveAdjustments` property to SC.View, which will return the current value of properties that are being animated.  This even works for accelerated transitions that use transforms and return CSSMatrix values while animating.
- simplifies the code somewhat and cleans up a lot of loose ends that remained since the original code was largely copy-pasted over from the old animation framework.
- removes an observer on the view's layout from within the layoutStyleCalculator and properly chained up the dependencies to remove some manual notification code.
- includes new unit tests"

publickeating,2012-12-23 21:53:30,https://api.github.com/repos/sproutcore/sproutcore/git/commits/579b225a4df4fd75777eb14c8c3f8bc57878c84e,579b225a4df4fd75777eb14c8c3f8bc57878c84e,"Refactors transition and animation testing of SC.platform; adds SC.browser.cssPrefix, SC.browser.domPrefix and SC.browser.classPrefix; adds SC.browser. experimentalNameFor(), SC.browser. experimentalStyleNameFor() and SC.browser. experimentalCSSNameFor() methods; and adds SC.UNSUPPORTED constant.

There were many problems with the animation and transition tests that existed before.  There was no forward support so browsers, like the Firefox nightly that have dropped prefixes, would fail to identify as supporting transitions and transforms.  Also, animation event listeners were hard coded into RootResponder for webkit only.  Also the event names needed to be forward supported as well and because there is no consistency in the event naming, the real transition and animation events may not have been captured on certain browsers.

Now, SC.platform does quick and precise tests to determine the actual event names allowing the RootResponder to listen only to the properly named events rather than using a shotgun approach with a bunch of different browser prefixes.

To make the code forward compatible for when prefixes are dropped, SC.browser has three new support functions:  experimentalNameFor(), experimentalStyleNameFor(), experimentalCSSNameFor().  These functions return the proper name for experimental names for object classes & properties, DOM properties and CSS attributes, not by guessing, but by testing the standard name and then testing prefixed versions of the name if necessary.  This allows developers to avoid writing code like:  SC.browser.cssPrefix + ""box-shadow black 0 1px 2px"", which will fail on browsers that no longer need a prefix and instead use:  SC.browser.experimentalCSSNameFor('boxShadow'), which will return either ""box-shadow"", some browser prefix + ""box-shadow"" or SC.UNSUPPORTED (allowing you to do something else).

- The css prefix and dom prefix were calculated from the user agent, which duplicated work already done with more rigor in SC.browser.
- Fixes duplicate 'input' property in SC.platform.
- Deprecates SC.platform.cssPrefix and SC.platform.domCSSPrefix."

This makes invokeNext the appropriate method to use when needing the DOM to be up-to-date before running code against it.

Previously, invokeNext functions would not run until the next run loop occurred, which if there were no events or timers, might mean that the code won't run for a long time.  While invokeLast lets you put code at the end of the run loop, the DOM will not have yet been updated and invokeLater is risky to use at small intervals, because if the interval is too small, the invokeLater code will run in the current run of the run loop and again the DOM will not have been updated.  Instead, invokeNext now ensures that the run loop completes execution and schedules an immediate timeout in order to allow the browser to update the DOM.

This works with the timer additions to the run loop, so additional run loops only run once even if there is an invokeLater expiring at the same time as the invokeNext timeout triggers a new run loop.

The way that SC.Set removes objects is to ""untrack"" the internal index of the object by shrinking its length, but it never actually removed the object at the last index.  The only way that the object could be freed is if a new object is inserted at the same internal index, thus replacing it.  If the objects were removed in the reverse order that they were added, every object would still be in the set (until they were possibly overwritten)."

Each time that a new observer is added to an object the ObserverSet for the object will add a tracking hash for the target and the method.  As more methods are tracked for the target, they are added and as methods are no longer tracked for the target, they are removed.  However, even when no methods are tracked for the target, the tracking hash for the target still exists.  This creates a small leak of memory, because the target may have been destroyed and freed, but we are still maintaining an empty tracking hash for it.

Here's an example that would create 3,000 empty hashes in coreOb._kvo_observers_key._members:

    obs = [];
    window.coreOb = SC.Object.create({ key: '1' });
    SC.run(function() {

Previously, views that had fixed sizes (i.e. width + height), but not fixed positions (i.e. not left + top) would still call parentViewDidResize on their own child views each time that the view's parent view resized.  However, this isn't necessary, because changes to the view's parent view will effect the view's frame, but if the view has a fixed size, it will not effect the child view's frames.

- This fixes a strange issue that occurs with SC.ImageView's viewDidResize implementation, where it fails to resize appropriately.
- This separates isFixedLayout into isFixedPosition + isFixedSize, allowing us more options to decide what to do when the layout is a fixed position vs. a fixed size vs. both vs. neither.

- The previous version had some broken code, such as checking for the existence of id, although it is not set anywhere previously or passed to the function and creating an existingId variable for no purpose.  It also wrapped most of the function in a run loop, but I'm certain it's not necessary.
- The previous version would create a new record even if the child record has no primary key, which would auto-generate a new primary key and thus a new store key each time that same child record needed to be re-accessed.  It also did extra work fixing up the store by having to manipulate the id after creation.
- This version generates a re-usable id upfront for child records that don't have a primary key value.  This means that the id is unique to that child record and if the child record is unloaded and reloaded, even though it doesn't have a primary key, it will still get the same generated id and thus, get the same store key in the store, preventing the store from creating new objects and leaking the caches on the old child record.

- The first time that you access a child record, the store updates four caches:  parentRecords (parentStoreKeys => [childStoreKeys]), childRecords (childStoreKeys => parentStoreKeys), records (SC.Record instances), dataHashes (SC.record backing attributes).
- Previously, if you set the child record to null or unloaded and reloaded the parent record or set the child record to a new child record and the child record doesn't have a primary key, the store would create duplicates on all these hashes, resulting in a memory leak.
- Now each time that you set the value of the child record on the parent, it clears the old child record caches in the store.

- Standardized set of properties on SC.browser:  device, name, version, engine, engineVersion, os, osVersion.  This will make it easier to match a specific browser (ex. Chrome), specific engine (ex. Webkit), a specific browser version (ex. Safari 5.0.5) or a specific engine version (ex. Webkit 533.16).
- Added constants for comparison: SC.BROWSER, SC.DEVICE, SC.ENGINE & SC.OS
- Better detection of browser version vs. layout engine version.
- Detecting blackberry browser/device/os.
- Detecting presto engine/version.
- Detecting gecko engine/version.
- Detecting android device/os.
- Several new user agents in unit tests.
- Added ISO 639-1 country code support and unit test: SC.browser.countryCode.
- Prevent bugs that exist when blindly transforming version Strings into Numbers for comparison.  For example, Version strings may have multiple sub-versions and may include letters like 'b' for beta. Use SC.browser.versionMajor(), SC.browser.versionMinor() or SC.browser.versionFloat() to correctly transform a version into a comparable Version.  (Not flawless, but much safer).
- Deprecated the multiple SC.browser properties, since there is no clear rule for what becomes a property (device vs. browser vs. engine vs. browser version vs. engine version) and it will be easy for future user agents to introduce bugs in any one of the properties since they are all calculated somewhat independently."

See extended commit message for potential breaking change.

As part of the bug fix, this change refactors responsibility for isTextArea completely into TextFieldView. Previously, it was awkwardly split by SC.FieldView and SC.TextFieldView. The change is fully compatible with the internal API, but if you have any application views that extend SC.FieldView and depend on the incomplete isTextArea logic in SC.FieldView, you will need to either extend from TextFieldView instead or implement your own support for isTextArea."

The issue is that when the property changes, the code necessarily updates the HTML but it attempts to attach events based on the HTML present in the DOM, resulting in a failure to wire up the change event properly. This case never arises if isTextArea is set statically at the time the TextFieldView is created. It arises if the property is changed after creation of the view, either manually or via a binding."

The bad thing that happens is that even though we cleared this.touch, occasionally if touchEnd() comes in right at the end of the Run Loop and then the timer expires and starts a new Run Loop to call beginTouchesInContent(), that this.touch will STILL exist here.  There's no explanation for it, and it's not 100% reproducible, but there is about a 40ms window where the firing timer and the end touch cause a crash.  What happens is that if we try to capture the touch that has already ended, assignTouch() in RootResponder will check touch.hasEnded and throw an exception."

Now compensates for when a given observer path has a dot index greater than 0 but the path doesn't start with ""this"". Instead if the first character is lower case then we assume the path is relative to the object, otherwise the path is considered relative to the window object. This was done since most people get confused using * and . when using the observes() function extension. This makes things easier (better developer ergonomics)."

Plus store.recordTypesByStoreKey would forever be stuck on the superclass Record Type.

Instead of generating the key at the bottom and passing it up, I generate the key at the top and recursively pass it back.  That way if a subclass claims the ID later, it can get the current key from its superclass and claim the Record Type for store.recordTypesByStoreKey."

Currently, the helpers ""bind"", ""boundIf"", ""if"", ""with"", and ""unless""
always generate a <span>.  This makes them unsuitable for rendering
block-level content, because HTML does not technically allow block
elements (like <div>) inside a <span>.

While browsers tend to gracefully handle such invalid HTML, it can
cause subtle breakage.  For example, jQueryUI makes assumptions that
break if you put divs inside spans.

This change allows an optional ""tagName"" parameter on the
aforementioned helpers.  So you can do:

{{#if someProperty tagName=""div""}}
<div>Some Content...</div>
{{/if}}"

Also, the bug fix removes need to double check frame updates within canvas render delegate, so removed some code.

Also, pulled the inner frame math out of SC.ImageView into a SC.InnerFrame mixin.  Custom views will be able to mix it in and then align and scale an inner element.  For example, this will be useful for custom list items that wish to best fit an img element without needing to rewrite the math themselves.

Finally, fixed some inaccurate unit tests and added tests for static layout with img and canvas elements."

Errors passed into the store via the error callbacks (dataSourceDidError()
and dataSourceDidErrorQuery()) are now written to internal arrays
(recordErrors and queryErrors, respectively).  These errors can then be
retrieved via calls to readError() and readQueryError().  Also modified the
errorObject computed properties on SC.Record and SC.RecordArray to invoke
these functions.  This way, when a record or record array transitions to the
error state, a simple get('errorObject') call will return the relevant
SC.Error object for inspection.

The readError() and readQueryError() functions on SC.NestedStore are simply
delegated to the parent store."
