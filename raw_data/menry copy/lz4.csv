When using an empty dictionary, we bail out of loading or attaching it in
ways that leave the working context in potentially slightly different states.
In particular, in some paths, we will cause the currentOffset to be non-zero,
while in others we would allow it to remain 0.

This difference in behavior is perfectly harmless, but in some situations, it
can produce slight differences in the compressed output. For sanity's sake,
we currently try to maintain a strict correspondence between the behavior of
the dict attachment and the dict loading paths. This patch restores them to
behaving identically.

This shouldn't have any negative side-effects, as far as I can tell. When
writing the dict attachment code, I tried to preserve zeroed currentOffsets
when possible, since they benchmarked as very slightly faster. However, the
case of attaching an empty dictionary is probably rare enought that it's
acceptable to minisculely degrade performance in that corner case."

This behavior has been preserved for compatibility with existing ecosystem.
But it's problematic, as some environment start `lz4` without identifying stdout as console by default,
leading to a change of behavior for a same line of script.

A more sensible policy would be to default to stdout only when input is stdin.

Soft change for the time being : keep the behavior, just print a warning message.
User should prefer `-c` to explicitly select `stdout`.

Also : updated tests in Makefile to explicitly select `stdout` with `-c`."

Fixes a mismatch in behavior between loading into the context (via
`LZ4_loadDict()`) a very small (<= 4 bytes) non-contiguous dictionary, versus
attaching it with `LZ4_attach_dictionary()`.

Before this patch, this divergence could be reproduced by running

```
make -C tests fuzzer MOREFLAGS=""-m32""
tests/fuzzer -v -s1239 -t3146

Making sure these two paths behave exactly identically is an easy way to test
the correctness of the attach path, so it's desirable that this remain an
unpolluted, high signal test."

which actively tries to make it write out of bound.
For this scenario to be possible,
it's necessary to set dstCapacity < LZ4F_compressBound()

When a compression operation fails,
the CCtx context is left in an undefined state,
therefore compression cannot resume.
As a consequence :
- round trip tests must be aborted, since there is nothing valid to decompress
- most users avoid this situation, by ensuring that dstCapacity >= LZ4F_compressBound()

For these reasons, this use case was poorly tested up to now."

The error can be reproduced using following command :
./frametest -v -i100000000 -s1659 -t31096808

It's actually a bug in the stream LZ4 API,
when starting a new stream
and providing a first chunk to complete with size < MINMATCH.
In which case, the chunk becomes a dictionary.
No hash was generated and stored,
but the chunk is accessible as default position 0 points to dictStart,
and position 0 is still within MAX_DISTANCE.
Then, next attempt to read 32-bits from position 0 fails.

The issue would have been mitigated by starting from index 64 KB,
effectively eliminating position 0 as too far away.

The proper fix is to eliminate such ""dictionary"" as too small.
Which is what this patch does."

the initial intention was to update lz4f ring buffer strategy,

Instead, it uses the destination buffer as much as possible,

Pretty efficient.

The previous change broke decoding with a ring buffer.  That's because
I didn't realize that the ""double dictionary mode"" was possible, i.e.
that the decoding routine can look both at the first part of the
dictionary passed as prefix and the second part passed via dictStart+dictSize.

So this change introduces the LZ4_decompress_safe_doubleDict helper,
which handles this ""double dictionary"" situation.  (This is a bit of
a misnomer, there is only one dictionary, but I can't think of a better
name, and perhaps the designation is not all too bad.)  The helper is
used only once, in LZ4_decompress_safe_continue, it should be inlined
with LZ4_FORCE_O2_GCC_PPC64LE attached to LZ4_decompress_safe_continue.

(Also, in the helper functions, I change the dictStart parameter type
to ""const void*"", to avoid a cast when calling helpers.  In the helpers,
the upcast to ""BYTE*"" is still required, for compatibility with C++.)

So this fixes the case of LZ4_decompress_safe_continue, and I'm
surprised by the fact that the fuzzer is now happy and does not detect
a similar problem with LZ4_decompress_fast_continue.  So before fixing
LZ4_decompress_fast_continue, the next logical step is to enhance
the fuzzer."

I noticed that LZ4_decompress_generic is sometimes instantiated with
identical set of parameters, or (what's worse) with a subtly different
sets of parameters.  For example, LZ4_decompress_fast_withPrefix64k is
instantiated as follows:

    return LZ4_decompress_generic(source, dest, 0, originalSize, endOnOutputSize,
		full, 0, withPrefix64k, (BYTE*)dest - 64 KB, NULL, 64 KB);

while the equivalent withPrefix64k call in LZ4_decompress_usingDict_generic
passes 0 for the last argument instead of 64 KB.  It turns out that there
is no difference in this case: if you change 64 KB to 0 KB in
LZ4_decompress_fast_withPrefix64k, you get the same binary code.

Moreover, because it's been clarified that LZ4_decompress_fast doesn't
check match offsets, it is now obvious that both of these fast/withPrefix64k
instantiations are simply redundant.  Exactly because LZ4_decompress_fast
doesn't check offsets, it serves well with any prefixed dictionary.

There's a difference, though, with LZ4_decompress_safe_withPrefix64k.
It also passes 64 KB as the last argument, and if you change that to 0,
as in LZ4_decompress_usingDict_generic, you get a completely different
binary code.  It seems that passing 0 enables offset checking:

    const int checkOffset = ((safeDecode) && (dictSize < (int)(64 KB)));

However, the resulting code seems to run a bit faster.  How come
enabling extra checks can make the code run faster?  Curiouser and
curiouser!  This needs extra study.  Currently I take the view that
the dictSize should be set to non-zero when nothing else will do,
i.e. when passing the external dictionary via dictStart.  Otherwise,
lowPrefix betrays just enough information about the dictionary.

    * * *

Anyway, with this change, I instantiate all the necessary cases as
functions with distinctive names, which also take fewer arguments and
are therefore less error-prone.  I also make the functions non-inline.
(The compiler won't inline the functions because they are used more than
once.  Hence I attach LZ4_FORCE_O2_GCC_PPC64LE to the instances while
removing from the callers.)  The number of instances is now is reduced
from 18 (safe+fast+partial+4*continue+4*prefix+4*dict+2*prefix64+forceExtDict)
down to 7 (safe+fast+partial+2*prefix+2*dict).  The size of the code is
not the only issue here.  Separate helper function are much more
amenable to profile-guided optimization: it is enough to profile only
a few basic functions, while the other less-often used functions, such
as LZ4_decompress_*_continue, will benefit automatically.

It occurred to me that the formula ""The last 5 bytes are always
literals"", on the list of ""assumptions made by the decoder"", is
remarkably ambiguous.  Suppose the decoder is presented with 5 bytes.
Are they literals?  It may seem that the decoder degenerates
to memcpy on short inputs.  But of course the answer is no,
so the formula needs some clarification.

Parsing restrictions should be explained as well, otherwise they look
like arbitrary numbers.  The 5-byte restriction has been mentioned
recently in connection with the shortcut in LZ4_decompress_generic,
so I add that.  The second restriction is left to be explained
by the author.

I also took the liberty to explain that empty inputs ""are either
unrepresentable or can be represented with a null byte"".  This wording
may actually have some merit: it leaves for the implementation,
as opposed to the spec, to decide whether the encoder can compress
empty inputs, and whether the decoder can produce an empty output
(which the implementation should further clarify)."

The bug is a read up to 2 bytes past the end of the buffer.
There are three cases for this bug, one for each test case added.

* An empty input causes `token = *ip++` to read one byte too far.
* A one byte input with `(token >> ML_BITS) == RUN_MASK` causes
  one extra byte to be read without validation. This could be
  combined with the first bug to cause 2 extra bytes to be read.
* The case pointed out in issue #508, where `ip == iend` at the
  beginning of the loop after taking the shortcut.

Benchmarks show no regressions on clang or gcc-7 on both my mac
and devserver.

Fixes #508."

The notes about ""security guarantee"" and ""malicious inputs"" seemed
a bit non-technical to me, so I took the liberty to tone them down
and instead describe the actual risks in technical terms.  Namely,
the function never writes past the end of the output buffer, so
a direct hostile takeover (resulting in arbitrary code execution
soon after the return from the function) is not possible.  However,
the application can crash because of reads from unmapped pages.

I also took the liberty to describe what I believe is the only sensible
usage scenario for the function: ""This function is only usable if the
originalSize of uncompressed data is known in advance,"" etc."

The simple change from
`matchIndex+MAX_DISTANCE < current`
towards
`current - matchIndex > MAX_DISTANCE`

is enough to generate a 10% performance drop under clang.
Quite massive.
(I missed as my eyes were concentrated on gcc performance at that time).

The second version is more robust, because it also survives a situation where
`matchIndex > current`
due to overflows.

The first version requires matchIndex to not overflow.
Hence were added `assert()` conditions.

The only case where this can happen is with dictCtx compression,
in the case where the dictionary context is not initialized before loading the dictionary.
So it's enough to always initialize the context while loading the dictionary."

Having a dedicated file for optimal parser
made sense during its creation,
it allowed Przemyslaw to work more freely on lz4opt, with less dependency on lz4hc,
moreover, the optimal parser was more complex, with its own search functions.

Since the optimal was rewritten last year, it's now a lot lighter.
It makes more sense now to integrate it directly inside lz4hc.c,
making it easier to edit (editors are a bit ""lost"" inside a `*.h` dependent on its #include position),
it also reduces the number of files in the project,
which fits pretty well with lz4 objectives.
(adding lz4hc requires ""just"" lz4hc.h and lz4hc.c)."

The LZ4 block format specification
states that the last match must start
at a minimum distance of 12 bytes from the end of the block.

However, out of an abundance of caution,
the reference implementation would actually stop searching matches
at 13 bytes from the end of the block.

This patch fixes this small detail.
The new version is now able to properly compress a limit case
such as `aaaaaaaabaaa\n`
as reported by Gao Xiang (@hsiangkao).

Obviously, it doesn't change a lot of things.
This is just one additional match candidate per block, with a maximum match length of 7 (since last 5 bytes must remain literals).

With default policy, blocks are 4 MB long, so it doesn't happen too often
Compressing silesia.tar at default level 1 saves 5 bytes (100930101 -> 100930096).
At max level 12, it saves a grand 16 bytes (77389871 -> 77389855).

The impact is a bit more visible when blocks are smaller, hence more numerous.
For example, compressing silesia with blocks of 64 KB (using -12 -B4D) saves 543 bytes (77304583 -> 77304040).
So the smaller the packet size, the more visible the impact.

And it happens we have a ton of scenarios with little blocks using LZ4 compression ...

And a useless ""hooray"" sidenote :
the patch improves the LZ4 compression record of silesia (using -12 -B7D --no-frame-crc) by 16 bytes (77270672 -> 77270656)
and the record on enwik9 by 44 bytes (371680396 -> 371680352) (previously claimed by [smallz4](http://create.stephan-brumme.com/smallz4/) )."

Pattern analysis (currently limited to long ranges of identical bytes)
is actually detrimental to performance
when `nbSearches` is low.

Reason is : `nbSearches` provides a built-in protection for these cases.
The problem with patterns is that they dramatically increase the number of candidates to visit.
But with a low nbSearches, the match finder just aborts early.

In such cases, pattern analysis adds some complexity without reducing total nb of candidates.
It actually increases compression ratio a little bit, by filtering only ""good"" candidates,
but at a measurable speed cost, so it's not a good trade-off.

This patch makes pattern analysis optional.
It's enabled for levels 8+ only."

lz4opt is only competitive vs lz4hc level 10.
Below that level, it doesn't match the speed / compression effectiveness of regular hc parser.

This patch propose to extend lz4opt to levels 10-12.
The new level 10 tend to compress a bit better and a bit faster than previous one (mileage vary depending on file)

The only downside is that `limitedDestSize` mode is now limited to max level 9 (vs 10),
since it's only compatible with regular HC parser.
(Note : I suspect it's possible to convert lz4opt to support it too, but haven't spent time into it)."

static analyzer `cppcheck` complains about a shift-by-32 on a 32 bits value,
which is an undefined behavior.
However, the flagged code path is never triggered in 32-bits mode,
(actually, it's not even generated if DCE kicks in),
the shift-by-32 is necessarily performed on a 64-bits value.

While it doesn't change anything regarding lz4 code generation, for both 32 and 64 bits mode,
(can be checked by md5sum on the generated binary),
the shift has been rewritten in a way which should please this static analyzer,
since it now pretends to shift by 16 on 32-bits cpu (note : it doesn't matter since the code will not even be generated in this case).

Note : this is a blind fix, the new code has not been tested with cppcheck, because cppcheck only works on Windows.
Other static analyzer, such as scan-build, do not trigger this false positive."

The bug would make the bt search read one byte in an invalid memory region,
and make a branch decision based on its value.
Impact was small (missed compression opportunity).
It only happens in -BD mode, with extDict-prefix overlapping matches.

The bt match search is supposed to work also in extDict mode.
In which case, the match ptr can point into Dict.
When the match was overlapping Dict<->Prefix,
match[matchLength] would end up outside of Dict, in an invalid memory area.
The correction ensures that in such a case,
match[matchLength] ends up at intended location, inside prefix."

Add an additional BUILD_STATIC_LIBS option to control building static
libraries independently of shared. This makes it possible (if both
options are set to ON) to build both shared and static libraries
simulataneously.

A dependant option is used to preserve the current BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
behavior, i.e. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -- shared lib only,
-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -- static lib only.

The targets used to build shared and static library are split now,
and only relevant properties are passed to each of them. An alias is
used to link programs to the preferred library."

cmake: significant changes to accomodate a new ""bundled"" mode."
nemequ,2016-11-08 21:31:47,https://api.github.com/repos/lz4/lz4/git/commits/661c48040ea485202f6ba1f0d029d1bc1fca963a,661c48040ea485202f6ba1f0d029d1bc1fca963a,"cmake: significant changes to accomodate a new ""bundled"" mode.

This makes it much easier to include LZ4 in a CMake-based project;
you only need to add_subdirectory(lz4/contrib/cmake_unofficial),
then you can use the lz4 target (which is the library).  In bundled
mode a static library will be built and nothing will be installed,
although the lz4 and lz4c command line tools will still be built.

This also makes some other much less intrusive changes, including:

 * Version information is now parsed from lib/lz4.h so the
   CMakeLists.txt file no longer needs to manually be kept up to date
   manually.
 * pkg-config file uses ${prefix} where appropriate instead of writing
   out full paths, which is important for people on Windows.
 * Warning flags are now checked instead of blindly added.
 * The GNUInstallDirs module is used to determine installation
   locations.
 * The static library generates position independent code, which means
   it's usable when building a shared library.
 * The CLI tools link to liblz4 instead of duplicating the object code."

Add a check to allow safe ""in-place"" decoding (meaning that the
beginning of the source buffer partially overlaps the end of the
destination buffer). This is usually possible as long as the output
stops at least 15 bytes before the end of the input buffer (7 to account
for the extra spill from LZ4_wildCopy, 4 for a possible block checksum,
and 4 for the terminating block header), but in some pathological edge
cases it could be possible for the output stream to overwrite a byte in
the input stream before it gets decoded. With this patch the decoder
will reliably detect those cases and return a decoding error.

Add forward/backward compatibility test between all versions

 - Add new Makefile target ""versionstest"".
 - Standard test procedure like ""make versionstest && make clean""
   works properly.

test/test-lz4-versions.py

 - This script creates test/lz4test and checkout all
   Release tagged versions.  After that, compile all versions of
   lz4c and lz4c32 and compress/decompress between all versions.

 - This test clones entire git repository to checkout all tags.
    - Since Travis's default command does not clone entire repository,
      we could not checkout all tags from Travis' default clone.

 - After that, test script shows all unique .lz4 files.  In this list,
   'r999' means 'head' of current working copy."

https://code.google.com/p/lz4/issues/detail?id=155

This is experimental implementation. Just a proof of concept.
It works Linux and Windows.

# Build

To build experimental version, define 'LZ4IO_ENABLE_SPARSE_FILE' like the following command :

    make lz4programs 'CFLAGS=-O3 -DLZ4IO_ENABLE_SPARSE_FILE=1'
    ./programs/lz4 -h

You will see ""EXPERIMENTAL_SPARSE_FILE"" as lz4 revision :

    ""*** LZ4 command line interface 64-bits EXPERIMENTAL_SPARSE_FILE, by Yann Collet (...) ***""

# Experiment

This experimental version adds option ""-x"" for sparse file for decompression.
You can use this option like this :

    ./programs/lz4 -9 -f my-file
    ./programs/lz4 -d -f -x my-file.lz4 my-file.lz4.out
    cmp my-file my-file.lz4.out"

For example: gzip file1 file2 file3. You can now do: lz4 [args] -m file1 file2 file3. Fixes 151.
