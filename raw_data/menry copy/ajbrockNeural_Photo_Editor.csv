The masking technique means the output image is based off the original
ground-truth image. After an aesthetically pleasing change is made, such as
growing the length of the hair, a new ground-truth image must be saved and
the latent space recalculated before a different change is made such as
changing the hair color."

Removed cuDNN as a dependency by replacing the DeconvLayers with
appropriately sliced TransposedConv2DLayers, and moving around some
imports and explicit DNN calls. cuDNN use is still the default, but can
be easily switched off by editing line 64 of NPE.py to ""dnn=False."""

Add pretrained model to repo with git-lfs.
Add another pretrained model with slightly more complexity (note that
this is different from the IAN architecture already uploaded, and
doesn't appear to be as suitable for use with the NPE as my slimmed down
version. I haven't been able to test it very well because my local GPU
can barely handle this model. Its sample quality appears to be higher,
but its reconstruction quality appears to be lower).
Fixed some unnecessary imports and keyerrors
Added MADE/IAF support to NPE.
Renamed l_latents to l_Z for consistency across models.
Found a bug in the MADE layer.

Added some comments, working on making the code more readable."
