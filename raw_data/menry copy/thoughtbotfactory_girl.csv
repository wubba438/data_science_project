Fixes #1305

Before Rails 6 when the build_stubbed strategy assigned an id on a
record without a primary key column, the `id=` method would no-op, and
the record would end up looking like a new_record (i.e. `new_record?`
would return true because the id was nil).

This problem surfaced because of a [change in Rails 6][rails], which
caused `id=` to raise a potentially confusing
`ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError: can't write unknown attribute ''`
for records without a primary key column.

Since build_stubbed stubbed was calling `id=` for all instances,
regardless of whether they had primary keys, it was raising the above
error.

To avoid this error, we check whether the instance has a primary_key
defined before setting the id.

We also changed `persisted?` and `new_record?` to be less dependent on
the id. That way those methods will work as expected for records without
primary keys.

In 241e8e5fb4e79865c2a9cd3c8ff858668f6ce2a9, this call to `undef_method`

redefined.

That warning is only printed when the method is already defined on the
class in question; it isn't printed when the method was inherited from
an ancestor, since overriding methods by shadowing them is a feature.

However, `method_defined?` returns true for inherited methods, which
means we're sometimes undefining methods that wouldn't cause a warning.

If a factory defines an attribute named `object_id` (admittedly not a
great idea), we will undefine the `object_id` method inherited from the
`Object` class, and the following warning will be printed:

    factory_bot/evaluator.rb:70: warning: undefining `object_id' may cause serious problems

By only undefining the method if it's defined on the current class, we
can avoid undefining inherited methods and triggering this warning."

In [#1156] we added support for looking up local traits with either a
symbol or string. This matches the lookup for factories and for global
traits.

We were calling `to_sym` on the trait arguments passed in when
building an object, assuming that those arguments would always respond
to `to_sym`. This leads to a confusing error message when passing an
object that doesn't respond to that method.

This PR replaces the confusing ""NoMethodError: undefined method `to_sym`
for ..."" with a more helpful ""KeyError: Trait not registered: ..."". It
ensures that all trait resolution is done using strings instead of
symbols, all objects should have a `to_s` method.

When sequence rewinding was first introduced in #1078 it only applied to
globally defined sequences. To get rewinding to work for inline
sequences as well we registered them ""privately"" in the global registry
in #1164. Unfortunately in #1164 we did not take inline sequences inside
traits into consideration. Since trait names are not unique, it is
possibly to get a `FactoryBot::DuplicateDefinitionError` when defining
two sequences that have the same name in two traits that have the same
name.

This PR abandons the idea of ""privately"" registering inline sequences,

The `FactoryBot` module has a mixture of methods that are meant for use
by people using the library, and methods that are meant only for
internal use. The methods meant for internal use are cluttering the
documentation, and may be confusing to users.

This change was prompted by [#1258]. Rather than introduce yet another
public method on `FactoryBot` meant only for internal use,
we can introduce a `FactoryBot::Internal` module,
and avoid generating documentation for that module.

The `FactoryBot::Internal.register_inline_sequence` method in [#1258]
will need access to the configuration instance, so this PR moves that
into `FactoryBot::Internal`. Eventually I plan to deprecate
`FactoryBot.configuration` and `FactoryBot.reset_configuration`, and to
move more of the `FactoryBot` methods into `FactoryBot::Internal`, but I
would rather hold off on all that until the dust settles on the 5.0
release.

Background
---

In issues #64 and #66 (from 2010) people expressed surprise
that using the `build` strategy would still `create` any associations.
I remember being similarly surprised by that behavior when I first
started using factory_bot.

The main reason for this behavior is to ensure the built instance will
be valid if there were any foreign key validations
(like `validates_presence_of :user_id`). If we don't save the
associations, there won't be any ids present.

PR #191 (from 2011) offers a workaround for people who don't want
records to be saved automatically. Passing `strategy: :build`
(originally `method: :build`, but later renamed) when declaring the
association will prevent it from being saved when using `build`.

But #191 isn't really a complete solution (as discussed on the PR
after it was merged). `strategy: :build` may do
the right thing when building objects with the `build` strategy, but it
can cause new problems when using the `create` strategy.

A better solution would be something like:
`strategy: <whatever strategy I was already using>`.
PRs #749 and #961 (merged in 2016) introduce something like that,
with the `use_parent_strategy` configuration option.
With this turned on `build` end up being generally [a little faster][]
than `build_stubbed`, since it no longer needs to hit the database for
each association.

[a little faster]: https://gist.github.com/composerinteralia/d4796df9140f431e36f88dfb6fe9733a

I have set `use_parent_strategy` on several projects now. I also added
it to suspenders in thoughtbot/suspenders#952.
On newer projects I have not run into any problems. On existing
projects I have seen the occasional test failure, which are easy enough
to fix by changing `build` to `create`.

Unfortunately I don't think `use_parent_strategy` is widely known,
since it wasn't documented until #1234 (about a month ago).
I also learned in #1234 that the `use_parent_strategy` setting gets
wiped out with `FactoryBot.reload`, which can be problematic when using
factory_bot_rails.

To summarize, we have been exploring having a `build` strategy that uses
`build` all the way down since 2010, but there still isn't a totally
reliable way to get that.

This PR
---

* Default to using the parent strategy for factory_bot 5, as suggested
in #749.
* In the original PR for this (#1240) I had removed
`use_parent_strategy`, but to make the transition smoother I ended up
fixing the reload problem in #1244

Once factory\_bot 5 is released and the dust has settled, it may make
sense to deprecate `use_parent_strategy`, and maybe also the strategy
option for associations."

Before this PR, `use_parent_strategy` was set on the configuration
instance. Since `FactoryBot.reload` wipes out the configuration, it also
ends up resetting `use_parent_strategy` back to `nil`.

This can cause problems when using factory_bot_rails with Spring, since
it calls `FactoryBot.reload` each time Spring forks. If
`use_parent_strategy` is set in a file that Spring preloads, like in an
initializer, then the value will get wiped out.

With this PR, we set `use_parent_strategy` directly on FactoryBot,
rather than on the configuration instance, and so reloading no longer
has any effect."

to make use of did_you_mean gem.

The did_you_mean gem only supports NameError, NoMethodError
and KeyError. However, for NameError the message does also need
to match a certain format and we can not use a custom message
like 'Factory not registered ...'. Therefore using KeyError
is to only logical conclusion.

The did_you_mean gem makes use of the receiver attributes, but
in Ruby > 2.5 it is not possible to set the receiver and key attributes
on a KeyError (they are only set when the KeyError is raised in C).
We explored monkey patching KeyError for earlier versions of Ruby, but
it was a problematic solution.

Instead we can rescue the original KeyError, take the message from it,
which will already include the did_you_mean message, then customize
the message and re-raise a new KeyError with that customized message.
Starting in Ruby 2.6 this will not be necessary anymore
https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14313, so maybe we can get rid of it
for FactoryBot 6 or 7.

This has come up a few times, and I can see why it might be helpful to
have access to full backtraces when debugging a factory error uncovered
by `FactoryBot.lint`. But since most of the time I don't want the extra
noise from the backtrace, I added this as a verbose option.

The default message is still:

```
The following factories are invalid:
* user - undefined method `save!' for #<User:0x00007ff0cbc89100>
* admin - undefined method `save!' for #<User:0x00007ff0cbc73e40>
```

And with the verbose option (usually with more lines of backtrace):

```
The following factories are invalid:
* user - undefined method `save!' for #<User:0x00007ff0cbc89100>
  /Users/.../thoughtbot/factory_bot/lib/factory_bot/evaluation.rb:18:in `create'
  /Users/.../factory_bot/lib/factory_bot/strategy/create.rb:12:in `block in result'

* admin - undefined method `save!' for #<User:0x00007ff0cbc73e40>
  /Users/.../thoughtbot/factory_bot/lib/factory_bot/evaluation.rb:18:in `create'
  /Users/.../factory_bot/lib/factory_bot/strategy/create.rb:12:in `block in result'
```

I moved the linting option defaults out of the FactoryBot.lint method
and into keyword argument defaults in Linter#initialize. This seems a
bit cleaner, and now we will get an error if we pass an option we don't
understand (before 6e511597 we had a test that passed in a bogus
option)

In this code we are passing an implicit declaration `user`, rather than
the symbol `:user`:

```rb
factory :post do
  author factory: user

This will raise a confusing error:
`undefined method 'name' for :comment:Symbol`.

This is coming from the implicit declaration `#==` method,
called on lib/factory_bot/attribute_list.rb#56.
The method wasn't ever designed to compare against
objects of different classes. I added some tests for all the declaration
classes to handle being compared against other kinds of objects.

Previously, instances created with the Stub strategy disabled a number of
methods defined by ActiveRecord::Persistence, to ensure that stubbed instances
did not read or write to the database. However, this blacklist was incomplete,
allowing some methods (e.g. #save!) to be called on stub instances.

This expands the blacklist to disable all methods defined by
ActiveRecord::Persistence that are not explicitly defined on stub instances
(currently #new_record?, #persisted?), or do not talk to the database at all
(#becomes, #becomes!).

The blacklist is correct as of current Rails master (the pre-release for Rails
5.0). It also, as a result, includes a couple of methods that are not defined
by ActiveRecord::Persistence in earlier versions of Rails, and will not
automatically include methods added to this module in future versions of
Rails.

It would be possible to make this automatic using reflection, and instead
using a whitelist of allowed methods:

    ActiveRecord::Persistence.public_instance_methods

However, at present this test is not dependent on ActiveRecord, so I have left
this for future work if desired."

this may greatly slow the time to lint factories."

Calling `block.call(self)` means any implied scope of block evaluation
goes out the window when an arity of 1 is used. This change uses
`instance_exec`, passing along self as the argument for the block
variable, meaning that the block is still invoked within the context of
the FactoryGirl::Evaluator while allowing the variable to have access to
the evaluator.

to conditionally define methods based on whether what we're dealing
with from the definition is actually meaningful. The base class
(DefinitionHierarchy) uses the defaults (an empty array for #callbacks

The previous implementation of trait handling within the Definition
didn't account for when implicit traits were used within other traits.
This is useful if you have two different traits, but one depends on
another; for example, a refunded order and a completed order could both
have the attribute `completed_at` set, but refunded would additionally
have `refunded_at` set:

    FactoryGirl.define do
      factory :order do
        trait :completed do
          completed_at { 3.days.ago }
        end

        trait :refunded do
          completed
          refunded_at { 1.day.ago }
        end
      end
    end

This also tests to make sure that callbacks, custom constructors, and
creation overrides work correctly when implicit traits are used within
other traits.

The twiddle-wakka specifying only major and minor (not tiny) versions
will grab latest minor, which ended up being 3.2 for all versions of
Rails supported. This ensures that when we report supporting Rails 3.0,
3.1, and 3.2, we actually test against those versions.

It also backports ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribed, which was
added in 3.2.

There were some big issues with trying to undefine specific methods on
the Evaluator. After investigating maybe inheriting from BasicObject (or
ActiveSupport::BasicObject since BasicObject is 1.9+), that turned out
to be too much of a pain because it undefines almost everything,
including class and a handful of other methods necessary for Evaluator
to work properly.

The second solution was to undefine all private methods. The problem is,
when other libraries defining methods (private or otherwise) on Object
are loaded *after* factory girl, those methods get added and Evaluator
sees those methods on Object. So, that solution didn't directly work either.

This commit removes undefining methods (the sole reason of which was to
capture with method_missing and process ourselves, returning the
override or cached value) and instead introduces a new concept -
iterating over each override and defining it as a method on the
evaluator INSTANCE. This means that overrides don't collide because
they're on the instance and we don't have to worry about undefining
methods so that method_missing kicks in. This is the most stable and
guaranteed way to get this to work because the overrides are applied to
each instance at runtime.

Closes #279, #285"

This allows for traits to be used with normal factories without having
to name every single factory that uses one (or many) traits.

So, instead of creating male_admin and female_admin factories:

    FactoryGirl.define do
      factory :user do
        trait(:admin)  { admin true }
        trait(:male)   { gender ""Male"" }
        trait(:female) { gender ""Female"" }

        factory :male_admin,   :traits => [:male, :admin]
        factory :female_admin, :traits => [:admin, :female]
      end
    end

    FactoryGirl.create(:male_admin)
    FactoryGirl.create(:female_admin)

You could just create a user with those traits assigned:

    FactoryGirl.create(:user, :admin, :male)
    FactoryGirl.create(:user, :admin, :female)

This can be combined with attribute overrides as expected.

    FactoryGirl.create(:user, :admin, :male,   :name => ""John Doe"")
    FactoryGirl.create(:user, :admin, :female, :name => ""Jane Doe"")"

Static attributes must be executed first because dynamic attributes might
rely on them. This is really important when using the :parent relationship.

Previous code didn't work fine in situations like this one:
  Factory.define(:generic_user, :class => User) do |u|
    u.email { |user| ""#{user.name}@example.com }
  end

  Factory.define(:flavio, :parent => :generic_user) do |u|
    u.name ""flavio""
  end

When building a :user object the previous code would have set the email
attribute and then the name attribute. This results in a user object with
an invalid email address: the 'name' attribute is yet not set while the
'email' attribute is evaluated.
