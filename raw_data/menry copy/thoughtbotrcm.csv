In mkrc, separate the list of files with newlines instead of spaces.

spaces with the bell character (`\a`).

rcup then sends the file name off to lsrc, which decodes the bell back
into a space.

The test makes sure an `a` character is in the filename, in case some
encoding goes wrong. We use tr(1) instead of sed(1) because tr(1)

Solaris 10 lacks readlink(1). Additionally, its different grep(1) and

Use a Perl one-liner instead of readlink(1) which is missing on Solaris 10.
Also because /usr/bin/grep and diff(1) don't understand the `-q` option, make
them go quiet by redirecting stdout to `/dev/null` instead.

The Perl dependency only exists in the test suite, so it does not incur
a runtime penalty for end users.

This is to work around the fact that readlink(1) is missing on Solaris.
The tradeoff is: on Solaris, installing third-party software (readlink)
is a pain, whereas on e.g. FreeBSD installing third-party software
(Perl) is simple and common."

Then, based on the synposis, I alphabeticalized the detailed listing of

host-specific directory.
- `rcdn -B foo` is just like normal `rcdn`, but with `host-foo` as the
  host-specific directory.

The `HOSTNAME` can also be set in the rcrc(5), and this is overridden by
the aforementioned `-B`.

Instead of requiring contributors to update rcm(7), pull the list of
contributors from the git log instead.

The `rcm.7` file has been moved to `rcm.7.mustache`. The `autogen.sh`
command will write `rcm.7` using autocontrib, a quick script included in
this commit.

This commit adds a `.mailmap` file, used by git-shortlog(1) to produce
correct and useful names and email addresses. An initial `.mailmap` has
been added to correct some existing email addresses and duplications.
`.mailmap` is documented in [Documentation/mailmap.txt][mailmap] for
git.

This adds a maintainer dependency on Ruby and the mustache gem. The
autocontrib program is spiked out in Ruby due to my familarity with the
language, but the choice of templating language (mustache) allows
flexibility for switching languages later. This is a dependency
requirement only for people who run `autogen.sh` -- maintainers.

This adds a maintainer dependency on git. Again, this is only for
maintainers, and many (all?) of them need git to get rcm's source
anyway.

Thanks to Patrick Brisbin and George Brocklehurst for the review.

The suite now honors the `COPY_ALWAYS` option in rcrc(5). This can be
set to a space-separated list of file globs. Any file matching a glob is
copied instead of symlinked. This is handy both for secure programs
(`netrc`, `ssh/id_*`) and for programs that oddly re-write files
(`weechat/*`).

To always copy everything, use the `*` glob.

This is reflected throughout the suite as follows:

* lsrc now has a `-F` option which shows a symbol to indicate whether it
  is a symlink (`@`) or a copy (`X`).
* rcdn only removes symlinks unless the file under question matches a
  `COPY_ALWAYS` glob, in which case it is removed regardless of whether
  it is a symlink.
* rcup will copy instead of symlinking any file that matches any
  `COPY_ALWAYS` glob."

With multiple source directories it is possible to have duplicates.

    .foo -> a/foo

Note the duplcate `foo` file.

We now handle this, in `lsrc` and therefore in `rcup`. We do this by
storing a `:`-separated string of destination files (e.g. `.foo`) and
`grep`ing that string before we operate on any destination."

The `rcup` and `mkrc` commands now support multiple source directories.
This is useful for sharing dotfiles between friends, spliting dotfiles
into private and public ones, or other such situations.

In `mkrc` this support means that you can specify the destination
directory for your dotfile, either from the command-line or from you
`~/.rcrc` configuration.

In `rcup` this means that it will recur through all source directories,
in order, creating the symlinks as needed. This means that duplicated
files will not be overridden. The order can be specified by the `-d`
option, which can be repeated, or by the `DOTFILES_DIRS` option in your
`~/.rcrc` configuration. The `-d` option overrides the configuration.

For example, this configuration file will update from the two
directories in order:

    DOTFILES_DIRS=""/home/mike/.dotfiles/public /home/mike/.dotfiles/private""

Any source directories that don't exist are skipped."
