Laravel v5.8 has a bit different way of getting environment variables.
The `ROUTING_LOCALE` variable is probably not set at boot time so it will not be available later on in the app lifecycle since `getenv` function is not used directly.
This fix is just using `getenv` as a fallback. Another option would be to just use it directly and not as a fallback for `env`."

* Add original url query to the result of getLocalizedURL.

* Change findTranslatedRouteByUrl so that it resolves URLs with their path rather than the full URL.
This will make it possible to match an URL when it has a query string (parameters that are not managed by Laravel).

* Fix extractAttributes so that it doesn't match the wrong route if the number of segment is the same. e.g: ""item/1"" shouldn't match ""project/{project_id}"".

* Fix extractAttributes so that URL that have an optional argument not present will still return the attribute with a null value. e.g: ""item"" matching ""item/{item_id?}"" will still return the ""item_id"" attribute, but null.

* Fix extractAttributes so that the attribute array won't return attributes from non matching routes. Also fix routes that have a smaller number of segment than the URL should be ignored since it's automatically not a match and would cause wrong matches.

* Fix extractAttributes so that empty value like a ""0"" inside a URL will still be treated as part of the URL. e.g: ""page/0"" for route ""page/{page_number}""
Also fix that routes with only an optional argument would automatically be rejected as a match.

* Remove the possible left-over '/' generated in getURLFromRouteNameTranslated.

* Add more tests to testGetLocalizedURLFormat for some use cases it wouldn't pass before.

* Change getRouteNameFromAPath to use the URL path so that it ignores additional parameters and also remove excess '/' from both the translatedRoutes and the URL for the final check.
Add a new unit test for getRouteNameFromAPath.

* Fix extractAttributes so that it remove the current locale from the URL path. This way we can match it with the routes. Add tests for this use case.

* Removed overuse of the shortand if for the urlQuery"
