Aside from being faster, it also requires less code.

This commit also changes the way architecture is detected for Win32 processes.
Previously, we relied on the Wine's preloader binary's architecture because we read its ELF header; now we read the NT header(s) by calling isWin32Process64Bit() (implemented in 86154c82344f130ed14633a21fdbe19b7937a80f)."

This is better than our current method because:
1. We don't need an extra handle (IsWow64Process() requires PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION or PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION).
2. It's more reliable: our current method consists in checking the result of IsWow64Process() (true if the process is 32 bit on 64 bit Windows) and the size of void * (4 bytes if 32 bit, 8 bytes if 64 bit).
It works correctly with a 32 bit plugin on 32 bit Windows and with a 64 bit plugin on 64 bit Windows; it doesn't work correctly when the plugin is 32 bit on 64 bit Windows: 64 bit processes are detected as 32 bit.
3. We can use the same method on Linux (the NT image is loaded in memory by Wine)."

These structures represent the header(s) of an NT image.

There are two ways to read the image:
- Loading the executable/library in memory and then reading the content at the beginning.
- Reading the process' memory at the beginning (base address).
  In the case of a loaded library, its header(s) can be found at its load (base) address.

By reading the header(s) we can gather useful info regarding the process, such as the architecture and, in the case of a library, the address of an exported symbol."

The crash happens when an invalid client is passed to jack_port_register().

This commit changes JackAudioInit::initialize() so that it aborts the initialization process in case the client cannot be opened (e.g. when the server cannot be started due to permission issues).

bJackIsGood was set to true by init_jack(), which was called by initializeInput() and initializeOutput(). In order to be able to check whether the client is correctly initialized (bJackIsGood == true) before making the backend available to the rest of the program (e.g. settings window), this commit merged init_jack() with JackAudioSystem() and destroy_jack() with ~JackAudioSystem().

The downside to moving the client initialization into the constructor is that it stays open (but not active) even when JACK is not used as backend, which is what currently happens with the PulseAudio backend.

In future we will improve the way audio backends are handled and fix the issue."

When Mumble is statically built, an executable and a shared library are generated.
The executable loads the Mumble library and calls its main entry point.

In order to do that we define the `MumbleMain` function in Mumble, which mimics Qt's WinMain() function.

The Qt qWinMain() function was used to parse command line arguments into a vector. However, this was no longer the case for normal Windows since Qt 5.4, and the function was removed in Qt 5.9.

Since Qt 5.4 the Windows API function CommandLineToArgvW()[1] is used for parsing the command line arguments. Consequently, we now use the same to do the same (this is the effective change of this commit).

The change history and use of qWinMain() in Qt is as follows:

* Before Qt 5.4 the qWinMain() function was used for all Windows platforms.
* Since Qt 5.4 the function was used only for Windows CE (and Windows RT?). Other Windows platforms use the CommandLineToArgvW() Windows API function.
* Qt 5.7 removed support for Windows CE.
* In Qt 5.8 the corresponding Windows CE code path in the main function was removed in https://github.com/qt/qtbase/commit/390598cb4392bbf5f77e8a05578e190b1a9f544a. Consequently qWinMain() was no longer in use but stayed for binary compatibility of the lib module.
* Qt 5.9 removed the now unused qWinMain() function in https://github.com/qt/qtbase/commit/71b54cc24431e8bc6e97f5d62132bd5261764c3a.

This change has been tested by building Mumble with MSYS2 and running it on Windows 10.

In protobuf 3.7 'g' is used as argument name, which conflicts with our global struct:

Azure Pipelines offers many advantages over AppVeyor, with the biggest one being a maximum of 10 parallel builds for open-source projects, drastically reducing the builds completion time.

A pipeline takes about the same time to build on the two CI infrastructures, however the caching feature is currently only available on AppVeyor, meaning that on Azure Pipelines the compressed environment is downloaded for each build consuming about 10 minutes.

This means that we'll save at least 10 minutes per pipeline compared to AppVeyor once the feature is added to Azure Pipelines: https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/9190"

Qt5 documents that QSqlDatabase must not be called from varying threads.
An instance must be limited to its thread.

In Mumble the Database class handles database access.
Up to now it contained static methods and always used the global default
database instance.
We instantiate the default database connection into the Global context.
It is mostly used from the main event loop, but also from a thread in
ServerHandler.
This is broken as per specification, and Qt 5.11 seems to finally enforce
that.

To resolve this issue, we promote Database to an instantiable class,
use the created Global context class instance from the event loop,
and a distinct Database instance (and connection) from the ServerHandler
instance (and thread)."

Having to many channels on a server can impact performance to the point
of making the instance unusably slow. This can be a problem for hosters
that allow their users unlimited channel creation.

This patch introduces a new per-server configuration parameter
channelcountlimit which can be used to configure a maximum number of
channels that may be created on each of the virtual servers. Once the
limit is reached channel creation will be rejected with permission
denied.

To allow a translated error message we have to bump the client version
to 1.3.1 to be able to use a fallback message for older clients.

As usual dbus, ice and grpc can ignore this limit. It is only enforced
against clients."

Our macOS Universal build has been dead for a while. This is due to an
interaction between XMLTools.cpp, XMLTools.h and Qt 4.

In Qt 4, the QXmlStream* classes once lived in the QXml module. In Qt 4.4,
they were moved to QtCore. However, to keep binary compatibility, the symbols
from QtCore are called QCoreXmlStreamReader/QCoreXmlStreamWriter.
The qxmlstream.h header then has preprocessor defines to map
QXmlStream* to QCoreXmlStream*. For more information, see:
https://github.com/qt/qt/blob/0a2f2382541424726168804be2c90b91381608c6/src/corelib/xml/qxmlstream.h#L100-L114

This means that the pre-declared classes used in XMLTools.h:

	class QXmlStreamReader;
	class QXmlStreamWriter;

won't work with Qt 4, >= 4.4, since QXmlStreamReader and QXmlStreamWriter
don't exist in QtCore in those verions of Qt.

This commit fixes that by including the headers for QXmlStreamReader and
QXmlStreamWriter instead of pre-declaring the classes.

This causes the right symbols to be used (that is, the QCore* variants),
and fixes the macOS Universal build."

This commit adds new class SvgIcon which allows you to create a QPixmap-backed QIcon
from an SVG.

We need this to fix mumble-voip/mumble#3124.

Basically, SVG-backed QIcons returns an empty list for QIcon::availableSizes().
There is some confusion as to whether this is the expected behavior or not.
(Tracked in mumble-voip/mumble#3374).

However: Plasma/KStatusNotifierItem currently expects QIcon::availableSizes()
to return a valid list of available sizes. For our SVG icons, that is not the case.

This commit works around this by constructing a QIcon backed by pixmaps, such that
QIcon::availableSizes() returns something sensible.

This is implemented via the static method, SvgIcon::addSvgPixmapsToIcon(), which renders

This commit fixes various problems discovered by building on Debian buster
which uses GCC 7. Building on buster gave various -Wimplicit-fallthrough warnings.

In Group.cpp and Server.cpp, we now use if statements instead of a switch with fallthrough.
This improves readability of the code, and fixes the implicit fallthroughs.

In PulseAudio.cpp, we had unintended fallthroughs in a switch statement, which have been
fixed.

In Cert.cpp, we had a potential fallthrough which was impossible to trigger at runtime,
fixed by adding an error return, like the surrounding code.

Altough our current MinGW builders use Wine as their test runner

it makes more sense to get blocked from merging on build failures.
The alternative is that we actively *check* that the MinGW is not
broken, which doesn't happen in practice.

We obviously can't expect Wine to mirror the exact behavior on any
particular Windows version, but let's just look at the MinGW targets
in .travis.yml as a check for whether a) the MinGW build works on Linux,
and b) whether our tests pass using Wine."

This PR includes two fixes for SRV port issues.

The first fix is for ServerResolver.  The Qt 5 (SRV) version had a bug where resolved ServerResolverRecords would be created with `m_origPort`. In practice, this meant that Mumble would *always* use the port specified in the ConnectDialog record for the server. Typically, this would be 64738, the default port.

The second fix is somewhat related to the first. The ConnectDialog had a bug where it would use `ServerResolver::port()` instead of `ServerResolverRecord::port()` when constructing the list of resolved addresses for a ConnectDialog entry. Unfortunately, `ServerResolver::port()` is the ""original port"". That is, the port specified in the ConnectDialog entry. Once again, this meant that Mumble would display the wrong port to user: the one from the ConnectDialog entry instead of the resolved port. Typically, this would be the default port (64738).

This commit removes the architecture-specific headers, by keeping only the OS-specific ones.
The different headers were needed to keep the legacy Windows header, after we created the ""procptr32_t"" (4 bytes) and ""procptr64_t"" (8 bytes) variables.
We created these variables because the ""peekProc"" functions read as many bytes as the variable can hold. A pointer is 4 bytes on 32 bit platforms and 8 bytes on 64 bit ones.

Now there's a new variable, called ""procptr_t"" and with a size of 8 bytes (unsigned long long).
We had a ""peekProc"" template function which returned the value stored at the specified memory address, but it has been used only to read pointers so far.
Since we needed a new function that checks the process architecture and sets the correct size of the memory to read, I decided to ""recycle"" it."

In a userbase of primarily gamers system instabilities aren't
that uncommon. Without synchronization of the user-db this can
lead to corruption of our client database storing the
user-certificate. We have had various reports of such issues
over time.

The current mode was set in 2010 in commit 9fee66e8 to speed
up the client-db ""even more"" though it is unclear whether we
actually had performance problems that required this step.

This patch switches the client synchronization mode from OFF
to NORMAL which according to the sqlite documentation will
leave a ""very small"" chance for database corruption but is
than the default FULL sync mode.

This commit should partially address issue #3254 by making
database corruption much more unlikely but detecting

The QSslDiffieHellmanParameters class is only available in Qt 5.8 or

When using Qt 4, or Qt 5 below 5.8, Murmur should refuse to run if
sslDHParams is set in the .ini.

However, with the introduction of the ""@ffdhe2048"" default value,
this mechanism broke: since the default value is not empty, users
of a Qt without QSslDiffieHellmanParameters would not be able to run
Murmur unless the explicitly set sslDHParams to the empty string.

This commit fixes the problem by comparing against the value from the
.ini, instead of potentially also checking against the default value."

This adds the ability to suppress global shortcuts injected from the main
thread. In practice, this means that Mumble will now honor suppressed keys
*inside* Mumble itself.

This is implemented using a std::promise<bool> in
InjectKeyboardMessageEvent and InjectMouseMessageEvent.

The injectKeyboardMessage and injectMouseMessage methods now
call shouldSuppress() on InjectKeyboardMessageEvent and
InjectMouseMessageEvent to retrieve a std::future<bool> from
the std::promise<bool> of the event. Calling get() on the
std::future<bool> shouldSuppress value blocks the
main thread until the GlobalShortcut engine's thread has set
whether the injected event should be suppressed or not in the
event's std::promise<bool>.

The injectKeyboardMessage and injectMouseMessage methods now return a bool
signalling whether or not the injected event is supposed to be suppressed
or not.

The gswForward method in MumbleApplication is also tweaked to return the
suppression status it receives from injectKeyboardMessage and
injectMouseMessage.

Finally, the event filters in MumbleApplication will now discard keyboard
and mouse messages when the gswForward methods returns true, which signals
that the GlobalShortcut engine told it that the injected event should be
suppressed."

This should fix the problem where some keys could not be observed in
Mumble when Mumble was the program in focus. People have reported this
problem with keys F13-F24.

The reason these keys could not be observed in Mumble is that:

Our keyboard and mouse hook callbacks do not receive keypresses and
mouse clicks when Mumble is on focus. We only recieve events when
other programs are focused.

DirectInput does not know of F13-F24.

To remedy this situation, this commit implements a system where we feed
the native Windows keyboard and mouse events from Qt's nativeEventFilter
into GlobalShortcutWin.

Technically, we provide methods in GlobalShortcutWin that allows the
nativeEventFilter to inject keyboard and mouse evnets into it. The events
from nativeEventFilter are received on the main thread. To inject them
into GlobalShortcutWin, we inject the mouse and keyboard messages through
two QEvents: InjectKeyboardMessageEvent and InjectMouseMessageEvent.

GlobalShortcutWin implements two new public-facing methods:
injectKeyboardMessage and injectMouseMessage. Internally, these methods
will cause a InjectKeyboardMessageEvent or InjectMouseMessageEvent
to be sent to the GlobalShortcutWin's event handler. This is done
through QCoreApplication::postEvent(), which means that the event
is handled in the receiving object's thread.

To achieve the ability to inject these events, some of general keyboard
and mouse handling code from our hook callbacks HookKeyboard and HookMouse
have been refactored into two new methods, handleKeyboardMessage and
handleMouseMessage.

These new methods are used in both HookKeyboard and the event handler for
InjectKeyboardMessageEvent, as well as in HookMouse and the event handler
for InjectMouseMessageEvent.

Note: the current implementation does not implement suppression of
keyboard and mouse events coming from the nativeEventFilter. This would
require us to block the main thread until GlobalShortcutWin has time to
handle the event. This is considered future work."

This commit introduces a new mechansim for executing OS-specific code

The entry point for os_early is ""os_early_init()"" which returns an int.
This return value, if non-zero, will cause Mumble to terminate, using the
return value as the exit status code.

This new system is quite similar to the exisitng os_init() system.
However, it differs in that this system is run very early (upon entering
main()), and it can cause Mumble to terminate, if necessary.

This commit only hooks up os_early on Windows. If other OSes need to
participate in the future, the code in os_win.cpp will need minor
changes."

Document that the button indexes in HookMouse() are DirectInput button
indexes.

The reason we use those, is that Mumble originally only used DirectInput
for global shortcuts on Windows. Later on, we added support for keyboard
and mouse hooks to get global keypresses and mouse clicks.

When these keyboard and mouse hooks are used, we actually get the same
event from *both* sources: First, we get it from the global hook. In
there, we have the option to suppress the event, so it doesn't get passed
on to us (or anyt other application). If we don't suppress it, it will
continue on further down the chain, and eventually we will receive the
same event via DirectInput. This means that in practice, we get *two*
events for all shortcut presses. Luckily, the underlying GlobalShortcutEngine
will treat them as one event because they arrive so close to one another.
However, for that mechanism to work, the internal decription of the events
will have to match. We chose to use DirectInput's representation as our
format. Because of that, we convert the incoming keyboard and mouse events
via our Windows hooks into the representation used by DirectInput."

This ensures that we apply all globally visible state from the lookedUp()
method before we attempt to auto-connect.

The previous block of code would, when auto-connect is enabled, call
accept() to perform the auto-connect. In case the selected ServerItem
has no username set, accept() will trigger a dialog box to appear asking
the user to input their desired username. Unfortunately, showing this
dialog causes Mumble to enter the event loop before the lookedUp()
method anticipated it to be entered. The point at which the auto-connect
happens, is before the lookedUp() method has had time to update the
global state of the ConnectDialog to reflect the successful host lookup.
In practice, this meant that the auto-connect would be triggered many,
many times in a row. In this scenario, Mumble would open a new username
dialog box for each auto-connect attempt. This would cause Mumble to
become unresponsive, because Mumble would spawn infinitely many username
dialog boxes.

the various global shortcut engines, was being destroyed by the wrong
thread.

The QTimer in GlobalShortcutWin is constructed within the
GlobalShortuctWin thread. So, the QObject belongs to that thread.
However, the destructor of GlobalShortcutWin is not called in the
scope of the thread. It is called on the main thread by
GlobalShortcutEngine::remove (in GlobalShortcut.cpp) when the last
GlobalShortcut object is removed.

This change works around the problem by not parenting the QTimer
to the GlobalShortcutWin object. Instead, it explicitly deletes
the QTimer after the GlobalShortcutWin thread's event loop has
exited.

Fixes mumble-voip/mumble#3189"

This gets rid of the errors in the Mumble log about destroying

The QProcess instances in OverlayPrivateWin are parented to the

The warning happened because the QObject destructor for OverlayPrivateWin
would destroy the QProcesses, because they are its children. However, at
that point, the processes were still running.

This commit remedies that by terminating the processes before the QObject
destructor runs."

Remove automatic generation of Diffie-Hellman parameters for vservers.

 - It was somewhat slow.
 - To avoid blocking the main thread while generating the DH parameters,

   could still execute (for example, clients could connect to the server

mkrautz,2017-07-09 09:30:10,https://api.github.com/repos/mumble-voip/mumble/git/commits/ab783c74330f0f630635be585bd7941d761fbfbd,ab783c74330f0f630635be585bd7941d761fbfbd,"Log: remove the notion of an invalid LogDocument.

Previously, the invalid state for a LogDocument that contained images
that Mumble deemed invalid.

For example, if Mumble was configured to not download external iamges,
a LogDocument that contained references to external images would be
marked as invalid, and would not show up in the user's log. Instead,
the whole message would be shown as ""[[ No valid image ]]"".

With this change, Mumble will instead show the message, but replace
the images with a 'broken image' marker (currently, Qt shows a 1x1
black image.)

This makes the 'Disable image download' option in Mumble more usable.
Before, messages that contained external (i.e, HTTP/HTTPS) images would
not be shown at all. This was not desirable, since such messages could
potentially contain messages alongside the images."

In mumble-voip/mumble#3153, it was reported that the new SRV code can
disconnect you from a server after a short while.

It turns out that we weren't being careful enough about our connection
timeout timer. A new timer was created for each connection attempt to
a server in the SRV list. In practice, this meant that 30 seconds after
each connection attempt, ServerHandler would try to tear down the
connection.

We now ensure we destroy the timer after we disconnect from a server.
This should ensure there is only one such timer active at any point in
time.

Many distros are now shipping OpenSSL 1.1.

However, Qt 5 only supports OpenSSL 1.0 at present.
A Qt Project changeset implementing OpenSSL 1.1 support
is currently slated for Qt 5.10.

This leaves us in a situation where we're inevitably going
to be in situation where Mumble and Qt will be forced to use
different versions of OpenSSL on most Linux systems.

The previous commit in this PR has added proper initialization
to Mumble's copy of OpenSSL, instead of relying on Qt's only
initialization, which only works if Mumble and Qt are using the same
copy. This should fix the crashes people have reported when trying to
use Mumble/Murmur in a configuration where Mumble and Qt each use
their own copy of OpenSSL.

I'm still wary of allowing this, but it seems like the cleanest
approach.

An alternative would be to have Mumble/Murmur to try and
dynamically look up the symbols they need to run. However, we don't
really have the proper infrastructure to suport runtime-loaded
dependencies on Unix-like systems. Nor is it something we've done
in the past. Also, using OpenSSL 1.1 headers against OpenSSL 1.0
might also prove problematic anyway."

This adds a hidden option to allow users to select which microphone
channels will be downmixed to mono.

Examples of using the setting:

	audio/inputchannelmask = 0x0  # Use no channels. Nothing is recorded.
	audio/inputchannelmask = 0x1  # Only use left channel (channel index 0)
	audio/inputchannelmask = 0x2  # Only use right channel (channel	index 1)
	audio/inputchannelmask = 0x3  # Use both left and right channel.

The value of inputchannelmask is used as a bit mask. If a given bit is
set, the channel with the same index as the bit will be included in the
final downmix.

In some environments, such as CI VMs/containers, we don't seem to get
the resolution we desire from QTime.

It's also worth noting that these tests were dormant in the repository
for a long time, until we hooked up 'make check'. So, they were quite
old, and assumptions made when the code was written might not hold up

This commit changes our check for whether a server is using a self-signed
certificate to check for the prefix 'Murmur Autogenerated Certificate'.

Previously, we would only check for 'Murmur Autogenerated Certificate v2'.
(The previous version, 'Murmur Autogenerated Certificate' is no longer valid,
so is not considered in this context.)

This will allow us to bump the version in the certificate, without needing
to update our code to know about these bumps."

This commit gets rid of manually allocated BN_GENCB structs
in favour of objects returned from BN_GENCB_new().

Why do this? OpenSSL structs are now considered opaque. Therefore, it is
not wise for us to allocate them based on their size in the current
OpenSSL header, since its size can change in the future.
Instead, we let OpenSSL allocate the object for us using the
BN_GENCB_new() method (and corresponding BN_GENCB_free() method for
freeing the allocated object).

These functions are only available in OpenSSL 1.1. To remedy this, this
commit implements mumble_BN_GENCB_new() and mumble_BN_GENCB_free().
On OpenSSL >= 1.1, these functions use OpenSSL's own new and free
functions. On prior versions, we allocate using malloc/free."

This was originally implemented in
2f07778a0eaf349b6a80489007ac31b7e54064f2.

This change was a mistake. We use the WH_CBT hook to inject our DLL into
potential targets. That means that every mouse/keyboard event will trigger
an attempt to load our overlay DLL, if it isn't already loaded.

That, combined with the new ability for the overlay to decline being
injected caused problems for processes that are blacklisted by Mumble:
Every mouse/keyboard event would attempt to load the DLL, go through the
exclusion checks (query the process tree, query the registry, find out
that the process is blacklisted, unload the DLL...).

We can't have that, so let's just revert this."

we have to add flags ourselves via dpkg-buildflags.

This commit implements a new CONFIG flag, CONFIG(dpkg-buildflags)

CXXFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS to QMAKE_CFLAGS, QMAKE_CXXFLAGS,
QMAKE_CPPFLAGS, QMAKE_LDFLAGS to ensure they are used in the Mumble

Previously, this would hide Mumble when switching workspaces in XMonad, and possibly other WMs
without a default notification area/system tray.

What happens when you switch to another workspace in XMonad is:

1. Mumble's MainWindow gets a ""spontaneous"" hideEvent. The window is now minimized.
2. Mumble's MainWindow gets a changeEvent, because of the state change from shown to minimized.
3. Because the window is minimized (via a spontaneous hide event), isMinimized() is now true.
   Mumble would then, before this change, invoke hide(). This causes the window to be non-visible:
   calling hide() is equivalent to calling setVisible(false).

This hidden state is never restored, not even for a spontaneous show event, so there is no
way, other than restarting Mumble, to get the MainWindow to show again.

This commit avoids calling hide() in changeEvent() on systems where no system tray is available,
such as XMonad.

Previously, the code tried to use floorf (in VolumeUp) and ceilf (in
VolumeDown) in order to ensure that VolumeUp and VolumeDown rounded to
the nearest 10%.

However, with /fp:fast on MSVC, that didn't work in all cases. For
example, in VolumeDown, the volume was previously always calculated via
ceilf(). On some occasions, a previous invocation of VolumeDown will have
set g.s.fVolume to a value close to 1.3 (130%). This value, when passed to
ceilf() would become 1.4 (140%) and subtracting 10% from that would still
be 130%. Not as we would expect.

This commit fixes the logic to not expect on exactness of floats via
floorf/ceilf. Instead of rounding to the nearest 10%, we just subtract
or add 10% to the current volume. It doesn't matter that it isn't a
multiple of 10."

Previously, this test depended on the fact that QTime is/was a low

This changes the test to only use the Timer class.

The test is re-written to run for 150 ms, to ensure that
we have enough samples to do a proper calculation. This
is also done to avoid fluctuations that could happen due
to context switches/overhead from other processes on the
test runner machine.

Since we don't compare to another timer anymore, we instead
explicitly test that the timer resolution is at least 5
microseconds. Currently, the Timer class doesn't spell out
its actual resolution, because its implementation varies
depending on platform."

This commit adds an 'excludecheck' module to the Windows overlay DLL that
implements the exclusion logic for the Mumble overlay.

It implements the new launcher filter mode, as well as the traditional
whitelist and blacklist-based approaches.

The rules for the launcher filter mode are:

 - Is the process blacklisted? Don't allow the overlay.
 - Is the process whitelisted? Allow the overlay.
 - Does the process's executable live in a whitelisted path? Allow the
   overlay.
 - Is one of the process's ancestors in the launcher whitelist? Allow the overlay.
 - Otherwise, disallow overlaw.

These simple rules, along with some sane defaults allow much finer-grained
control over the overlay -- and it allows us to ship a default profile
where we practically only inject into games."

This change adds the user interface and config dialog logic
needed for the overlay launcher filter.

This adds an additional mode to the overlay called the 'launcher filter'.

The idea behind the launcher filter is that we provide a sensible
whitelist of allowed launchers (which are typically digital storefronts,
and other launchers -- Steam, Origin, GOG, Battle.net, MMORPG launchers,
etc.), as well as a default whitelist of normal programs, because some
things don't fit into the 'launcher' check -- such as Guild Wars 2.

The existing 'blacklist' and 'whitelist' modes are still available,
as before.

This commit also changes the way ""default"" entries are shown.
Instead of being in a disabled state, they are now shown in italic.
Also, default entries now have a checkbox next to them, allowing users
to disable default entries.

Regarding new whitelist functionality:

To support the launcher filter overlay mode, we've added a default set of
programs to Mumble's whitelist.

However, when in 'whitelist' mode, Mumble has traditionally not provided
any defaults.

Also, for the whitelist mode to be useful to people, it should not have
any defaults -- because the whole purpose of the whitelist is for people
to be 100% in control themselves.

This commit also changes the UI in OverlayConfig to not show the defaults
from overlay_whitelist.h when in WhitelistExclusionMode."

This pull request implements support for building Mumble and Murmur with the MinGW toolchain.

Both x86 and x86_64 targets are supported, and most features work.

For now, we use, and test against MXE (http://www.mxe.cc).

The PR also implements a Linux-based cross-build of Mumble and Murmur on Travis CI. This environment uses Wine as a test runner."

@tatokis reported a voice recorder crash on IRC.
(Also filed as mumble-voip/mumble#2863)

The main culprit was missing error checking in flushCheck() for the values
of iTarget and iPrevTarget.

The problem is that iPrevTarget can be set to -1 in error situations,
when using voice target shortcuts. (Whispers and shouts.)

When that happens, the message type output by flushCheck() will be set
to an invalid value (7), because iPrevTarget is -1.

In flushCheck(), when the packet is a terminator, we set the packet's flags
to the value of iPrevTarget. However, in some error states, iPrevTarget is -1.
When flags is set to -1, all bits are high (say, 0xffffffff on 32-bit
systems). Since all bits are high, our attempt to set the message type in
the flags byte fail, because we attempt to splice it in there via binary
OR.

The result is a packet with an invalid message type of 7 gets into our
audio subsystem and wreaks havoc. Due to mistakes in other code in
AudioOutputSpeech, that invalid value could cause a crash. (The problem
was that we expected that all packets that weren't Opus or CELT to be
Speex. Even 'unknown' message types. This will be fixed in a separate
commit.)

This series of commits cleans up the use of QSslSocket::defaultCaCertificates() to avoid using a global CA certificate list for all servers.

This is preparation for hot-reloading SSL certificates.

Instead of using the global QSslSocket::defaultCaCertificates() list, we now keep our own lists.

For the MetaParams class, that means we now have a qlCAs list (that contains the certificates from the PEM bundle pointed to by murmur.ini's sslCA option) and a qlIntermediates list (that contains any non-leaf certificates from the sslCert option in murmur.ini.).
This allows us to properly apply CA certificates and intermediates in the contexts we need it. For CA certificates, that is when connecting to the registration server, and the per-user QSslSocket for client certificate verification. For intermediates, we use those when a virtual server inherits the Meta server's cert/key.

For the Server class, that means we rename qlCAs to qlIntermediates, to properly reflect its use. Before this change, any non-leaf certificates found in the server's certificate blob would be added to qlCAs. Now, to mirror qlIntermediates in the MetaParams class, we've renamed Server's qlCAs to qlIntermediates."

The sslCA option is used by people to specify extra CA certificates.

Before this patch series, the certificates from sslCA would be added
to the QSslSocket::defaultCaCertificates() list via MetaParams. Thus,
those certificates were automatically treated by QSslSocket as valid
root certificates -- by all QSslSocket instances in Murmur.

Since we've now stopped adding the sslCA certificates to the global
QSslSocket::defaultCaCertificates() list, we now have to add them to
each QSslSocket as necessary, for them to be treated as CA certificates.

One use-case for murmur.ini's sslCA option is to add extra CA
certificates in case the system CA store doesn't contain the necessary
certificates.

In Murmur, one place where CA certificates are used is when verifying
client certificats. In Murmur, if a user is using a valid CA-signed
certificate, that user has passed the 'strong' check.

As mentioned, before this patchset, all the certificates from the PEM
bundle pointed to by murmur.ini's sslCA option would be added to
QSslSocket's global default CA certificates list, which is available
via QSslSocket::defaultCaCertificates().

Thus, any CA certificates in sslCAs would be treated as CA certificates
when verifying client certificates of conecting clients.

To keep this behavior, we now add MetaParams's qlCAs to the CA list of
the each connecting client's QSslSocket.

This is useful if you are using private CA for signing
identities for Murmur. If you put your CA certificate into the PEM
bundle pointed to by sslCA, Murmur will treat users with a certificate
issued by that CA as having a valid ('strong') certificate.

Another useful use-case for this is if a user is running Murmur on an
unsupported OS, where certificate verification doesn't work due to Murmur
or Qt not being able to find the system's certificate store. In this
scenario, it is possible to point murmur.ini's sslCA option the sytem's
CA bundle, or a PEM copy of the Mozilla CA bundle. That way, verification
of client certificates from generally trusted certificate authorities is
restored."

In Murmur, one of the only places CA certificates are used, is when
connecting to the registration server via HTTPS. In theory, the system
certificate store should contain the root CAs necessary for connecting
to the registration server on our supported OSes. But it might not for some
unsupported OSes. For example, if someone is using Murmur on an unsupported
OS where we or Qt do not know how to read the sytem's CA store, it will not
be able to establish a conection to the registration server. On such a system,
a user will be able to use the sslCA option in murmur.ini to fix certificate
validation for the registration server, by pointing sslCA to the system's
PEM certificate bundle, or a PEM copy of the Mozilla certificate store.

This commit keeps that behavior. Some people are possibly using sslCAs
for pointing Murmur to a CA bundle -- and we don't want to break their
setups."

We would also add any certificates found in the sslCA PEM bundle to the

Due to the way the hot-reload feature for SSL settings is going to work,
these patterns wouldn't work well in that environment, because reloading
the settings would keep adding entries to the global QSslSocket default
CA certificates list. (QSslSocket::defaultCaCertificates())

To combat this, this series of commits try to be more strict about how
default CAs and intermediates in general are handled.

Generally, instead of adding them to the global QSslSocket default CA
list, we add them to each QSslSocket as necessary.

That is what we've relied on in mumble.pro previously.

However, that doesn't always work for all Qt installations.

To fix that, this change introduces a new lookup strategy for the 'lrelease' binary.
Instead of relying on it being in the user's default $PATH, we use qmake's QT_INSTALL_BINS
variable. That path is guaranteed to contain an 'lrelease' binary if the correct packages are
installed -- for both Qt 4 and Qt 5."

Previously, we always used the directory holding mumble.exe
as the working directory.

This commit changes that to use the versioned root directory
as the working directory -- if we're using one.
When not using a versioned root directory, the old behavior
is kept intact.

This is primarily done to work around mumble-voip/mumble#2837,
where, when loading mumble_app.dll on Windows 7, the search order
for ucrtbase.dll seems to be using the ""Standard Search Order for
Desktop Applications"" instead of the ""Alternate Search Order for
Desktop Applications"", as it should when we specify
LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH to LoadLibraryEx.

For context, see the following MSDN page:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586.aspx

Changing the working directory to the versioned root path allows
the Universal CRT to be correctly loaded -- via step 5 of the ""Standard
Search Order for Desktop Applications"" if SafeDllSearchMode is on --
despite this weird behavior from the system.

useless for us.

To sidestep this problem, we'll simply go back to relying on the OSes
version of dbghelp.dll. Shipping an outdated version of dbghelp.dll
isn't sensible. We're better off allowing Windows 10 to use a modern
(its own) version of dbghelp.dll than using a year-old version.

To give some context on how we use dbghelp.dll:

In Mumble, we use dbghelp.dll for writing our Minidumps.

In Murmur, Ice uses it for symbolicating stack traces in
Ice exceptions."

This fixes the invocation of protoc in mumble_proto.pro to be compatible with out-of-tree builds. For example, this is how Qt Creator builds Mumble by default.

For out-of-tree builds, our include path flags to protoc aren't sufficient. This is because protoc requires that the .proto file it is building is part of the include path. To fix this for out-of-tree builds, we add the absolute path to the directory that contains the .proto file.

This allows protoc to work for out-of-tree builds.

For reference, the error we got (before this commit) from protoc in out-of-tree builds was:
""File does not reside within any path specified using --proto_path (or -I). You must specify a --proto_path which encompasses this file. Note that the proto_path must be an exact prefix of the .proto file names -- protoc is too dumb to figure out when two paths (e.g. absolute and relative) are equivalent (it's harder than you think)."""

Qt 5.6 changed QDBus to use a thread, QDBusConnectionManager,
for managing DBus connections.

This caused a bad interaction with Murmur. It turns out that, prior
to this commit, the QDBusConnectionManager in Murmur was launched at
program start, because of a global static QDBusConnection in DBus.cpp.

This meant that there would be a QDBusConnectionManager thread around,
waiting to manage DBus connections. ...Until Murmur calls fork().

After fork()ing, the QDBusConnectionManager thread is gone -- fork only
keeps a 'main' thread, and isn't generally compatible with multi-threaded
programs.

Ouch!

Fortunately, the static global QDBusConnection (MurmurDBus::qdbc) was
only initialized this way because it worked in the past. Also, because
QDBusConnection has no default constructor, the 'qdbc' QDBusConnection
was statically initialized as a QDBusConnection to 'mainbus' on each
program launch. This wasn't strictly necessary -- it was only done because
QDBusConnection had no default constructor. However, there is no such thing
as an 'empty' QDBusConnection, so there not being a default constructor
does make sense.

To avoid the static global QDBusConnection, this commit changes MurmuDBus::qdbc
from a value to a pointer.

This allows us to defer the creation of the QDBusConnectionManager thread
until the first 'real' QDBusConnection is created -- after Murmur has forked.
This avoids the global static 'fake' QDBusConnection, and ensures the
QDBusConnectionManager thread is created after Murmur has forked.

Additionally, this commit also moves the registration of the 'MetaDBus'
object into the '!Meta::mp.qsDBus.isEmpty()' check in main.cpp.
This ensures the MetaDBus object is only registered if the user has
enabled DBus in murmur.ini. Without this change, the code would be
dereferencing a null MurmurDBus::qdbc.

mkrautz,2017-02-05 18:20:34,https://api.github.com/repos/mumble-voip/mumble/git/commits/c895dad88962dc88691520c977151f1d16e7522e,c895dad88962dc88691520c977151f1d16e7522e,"installer: ship app-local copies of UCRT DLLs.

MSVC2015 uses a new CRT called the Universal CRT.

This CRT is distributed in different ways, depending on your
OS.

For Windows XP, the official distribution is a VCRedist installer.
(Or, for Windows XP only -- merge modules).

For Vista through 8.1, UCRT is distributed via Windows Update.

For Windows 10, it's shipped as part of Windows.

This commit amends our installer to install an app-local copy of
the Universal CRT. This is the sanest way for us to distribute the
Universal CRT across all supported targets.

Even if we could drop Windows XP support, the fact that earlier
Windows versions deploy the Universal CRT through Windows Update
makes it a hard pill to swallow. People's hacked up machines might
not be able to get the update from Windows Update for whatever reason.
(Maybe they disabled the Windows Update service for performance reasons,
because a guide on the web told them to?)

So, for now, this is what we'll do. Perhaps it makes more sense to
statically link the UCRT instead of this massive soup of DLLs. But
this is a quick fix to keep our snapshots going until we can work
out the details for statically linking UCRT.

Note: Because Murmur is outside the versioned root-dir, we ship a
separate CRT copy for Murmur. Now that we have to ship the UCRT as
well, that's suddenly a lot more files we'll have to carry. That's
also an unfortunate side-effect of the UCRT. But if you look at it
from the perspective that shipping the VCRUNTIME+UCRT on MSVC2015
""the same thing"" as shipping MSVCRT on MSVC2013, we're not really
doing anything much different. Except, we're being ""punished"" by
the fact that Microsoft decided to split up the CRT into tiny pieces.

Future work: Ideally, we wouldn't include these .wxi files in the
repo, and instead depend on gen-ucrt.py being run before building
the installer. However, that would require buildenv changes, and
require us to redeploy buildenvs, which takes time. To get the UCRT
fix out into a snapshot, let's add them to the repo for now, and we
can clean it up later."

This uses the mechanism documented at
http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/msbuild/daily_builds.html
to use a local copy of WiX instead of using the WiX MSI package.

Previously, we required people to install WiX globally.
That's yet another tedious dependency required in order to build Mumble.

We'll now be distributing WiX in our buildenvs, so tell our .wixproj
to use that version."

This drops the workaround we added in c04aa4e8 (see also
mumble-voip/mumble#2429). There was a Qt regression in
early 5.6 versions that caused our previously working
monochrome bitmap drawing code to break.

To be fair, our original code was not exactly correct
per the Qt docs, but it did produce correct results before
Qt 5.6.

Qt accepted the bug as a regression, and restored the old
behavior, so we can now keep using the old behavior.

We should re-visit this soon, because the drawing code
isn't actually correct according to the Qt docs.

But it works. At least until Qt 6.

When built against the MSVC2015 CRT, we can't mix-and-match non-wide and
wide environment variables anymore.

Prior to this commit, MumbleApplication::applicationVersionRoot() used
Qt's qgetenv().

However, because of our change to MSVC2015, we can't use Qt's function
anymore.

Instead, we introduce getenvQString (a static function, local to
MumbleApplication -- for now). This function uses _wgetenv_s on
Windows to retrieve environment variables (expecting that they're all
UTF-16). On non-Windows systems, it uses getenv (and expects keys and
values to be UTF-8).

by mkflags.py. This will now generate only one qrc file because the svg
files are substantially reduced in size, all together 440.638 bytes in

actually get only one qrc file)."

Without this, we delay the log messages from -limits
until we exit with a qFatal.

This isn't good, because -limits *can* fail in ways that
cause it to get stuck. One example of this is when Murmur
runs out of memory. This typically happens on 32-bit systems
during the test that counts the number of threads Murmur can
spawn, given the system's resource limits.

One such instance is if we reach the virtual memory limit on
i386. Then, QThread::start() will try to call pthread_create(),
which fails with EACCESS. (Insufficient resources, system-imposed
or otherwise). Qt doesn't handle this error situation, but
instead calls qWarning to make the user aware.

Without this change, we would never present this warning to
the user, because Murmur would be stuck.

With this change, the user can at least see the warning, to

Previously, the python.pri helper would try to query which python
binary on the system to use via the 'which' command.

Some systems do not have which (some Docker-based CI systems,
for example).

We now detect the presence of 'which'. If it is not available,
we try to use 'python' as the Python command. We also print a
warning about 'which' not being available -- as well as a message
pointing users to the MUMBLE_PYTHON environment variable.

This commit documents the intent behind Audio::stopInput(), Audio::stopOutput() and Audio::stop().
Namely that the functions are coded the way they are to guarantee deterministic destruction of
AudioInput/AudioOutput on the main thread.

It also adds documentation to the AudioInput and AudioOutput constructors and destructors that
spells out the guarantee that they can only ever be called on the main thread, and only by
the Audio::startInput(), Audio::startOutput(), Audio::start(), Audio::stopInput(), Audio::stopOutput()
and Audio::stop() methods."

This reverts PR #2674. That PR has a bug in stop(), stopInput() and stopOutput().

Specifically, the original code was structured such that destruction of
the AudioInput and AudioOutput objects would happen inside any of the stop methods.
However, the new implementations of stop(), stopInput() and stopOutput() in PR #2674
could cause the AudioInput and AudioOutput objects to be destroyed at any site that
takes a copy of g.ao or g.ai.

This happened in the PulseAudio backend. The AudioInput destructor would be called
while holding the PulseAudio mainloop lock. The destructor of the Pulse backend's
AudioInput also, tries to take the PulseAudio mainloop lock, causing an abort() to
happen.

Let us revert PR #2674 for now. There is no obvious way to implement the controlled
destruction behavior of the boost::shared_ptr with QSharedPointer. We also don't have
any code in Mumble that requires the audio shared pointers to be atomic (which was the
reason for the PR in the first place).

This change modifies CryptState to use AES_KEY_SIZE_BYTES and
AES_KEY_SIZE_BITS constants instead of using AES_BLOCK_SIZE.

This cleans up the code, making it easier to read and understand.
The key size is a distinct concept from the block size, even though
Mumble only offiiclaly supports OCB-AES128.

This also allows users of custom builds to bump their key size to
256-bit, if they desire. Of course, such builds will not be compatible
with any existing Mumble server, because neither Mumble nor Murmur
currently supports negotiating the crypto mode used for voice packets."

It is replaced with a variable, mumble_hw_hwnd, which gets
filled out in main.cpp just after creating MainWindow.

Most MumbleHWNDForQWidget() uses were for g.mw, so the change
makes sense. The ones that weren't have been changed to use it,
or removed. Most of the removed instances are g.ocIntercept-related,
which is already broken beyond repair in Qt 5."

This introduces a new variable, QT_VERSION_INT, which allows
qmake files to more easily do Qt version checks.

Previosly, code would chain greaterThan/equals/lessThan with
logical ands for QT_MAJOR_VERSION and QT_MINOR_VERSION.

That worked OK, but was a little verbose, and is inconvenient
if you want to use a QT_VERSION check alongside other conditions
in a conditional.

The QT_VERSION_INT is a string variable is of the form:

  Qt 5.0.0:   50000
  Qt 5.6.1:   50601

it is base 10, and can be used with qmake's comparison operators
like so:

  greaterThan(QT_VERSION_INT, 50600) {
    // Do stuff for Qt > 5.6
  }

This commit also removes our own copies of QT_MAJOR_VERSION
and QT_MINOR_VERSION. These are provided by mkspecs/qconfig.pri,
and have been since (at least) Qt 4. So they're already available.
We don't need to provide them. Our method of fetching them was also
buggy due to Qt 4 compatibility - so that's fixed now."

QSharedPointer is thread-safe and atomic, while boost::shared_ptr isn't.

For some audio systems, this is necessary for proper implementation (for
example, an audio system where AudioOutput runs the show, and AudioInput
is simply 'fed' data from AudioOutput -- like my upcoming 'sndio' backend).

Most of this commit is straight-forward. Most of the change is simply
renaming the types and fixing up uses of boost::shared_ptr::get() to
use QSharedPointer::data() instead. Some places also use operator bool()
now. For Qt 4 compatibility, we also no longer use the restet method of
the shared pointer, instead preferring clear() which is available in both
Qt 4 and Qt 5.

In Audio.cpp, in stop(), stopInput() and stopOutput(), the
boost::shared_ptr-based code used the unique() method on
boost::shared_ptr. That doesn't exist for QSharedPointer,
so we emulate the old behavior by keeping a QWeakPointer to
the object around. Once the weak pointer is no longer valid,
we know the AudioInput/AudioOutput object has been fully
destroyed."

This commit changes various pri and pro files to always prepend
the global build output directory (which can be either 'release'
or 'debug', depending on the current build configuration).

Otherwise, if a library that we build ourselves, such as -lspeex in
CONFIG+=bundled-speex, is also available in one of the other lib dirs,
we can't be sure that the one in our build output directory will be used.

This is a problem on FreeBSD, where we add /usr/local/lib
to the QMAKE_LIBDIR in compiler.pri. That directory might contain
its own -lspeex.

With this change, we now prefer libraries in our build output directory
to system libraries."

Before this commit, BonjourServiceResolver would not consistently
tear down the ResolveRecord when an error occurred.

The 100% CPU usage problem from issue 2223 happens in
BonjourServiceResolver::bonjourResolveReply, where previously,
the ResolveRecord was removed from qmResolvers for both error
and success -- but was never deleted on error. To fix this issue,
we delete the ResolveRecord for bonjourResolveReply's error case.

For constency, we also introduce similar code in the
BonjourServiceResolver::bonjourSocketReadyRead method.
Now, if DNSServiceProcessResult returns an error, we tear down
the ResolveRecord and remove it from qmResolvers."

When handling low-level Windows key events, we emit them to the
GlobalShortcut engine using the same key ID that we use for
the DirectInput backend.

Unfortunately, the existing code for generating a DirectInput
compatible key ID didn't produce correct results for NumLock
and Pause.

This commit fixes that by special-casing the translation of the
""extended key"" flag when translating a scancode into a DirectInput
key ID.

Now, we ensure that the extended flag bit is ALWAYS set for the Pause
key (even though it isn't in the low-level key event). We also ensure
that the extended flag bit is NEVER set for the NumLock key (even though
it is in the low-level key event).

This yields correct DirectInput key IDs for NumLock and Pause keys.

ServerHandler: reconnect to the server if it is not responding to TCP pings"
mkrautz,2016-11-06 17:02:49,https://api.github.com/repos/mumble-voip/mumble/git/commits/9fc379a6fd7d090ac7c5a3d051fd19814ed5a83e,9fc379a6fd7d090ac7c5a3d051fd19814ed5a83e,"ServerHandler: reconnect to the server if it is not responding to TCP pings

This is implemened via a 'max in-flight TCP pings' counter, and
a rule for how many in-flight TCP pings there can be at one
point in time. (The default being 2, which means a client will
disconnect from a server if it takes the server more than 10
seconds to reply to a single ping message, given that Mumble
sends ping messages every 5 seconds.)

The idea is simple: ServerHandler keeps a counter of the number
of TCP pings it has sent, but has not yet received a response for.

When ServerHandler sends a ping, it increments the counter.

Once a pong or response for the ping has been received, it
resets the counter to 0.

But most importantly, ServerHandler now checks the amount
of in-flight TCP pings before it sends a new ping message.
If the counter exceeds the maximum number of allowed in-flight
TCP pings, it disconects from the server, allowing the client
to try to re-establish the connection.

One scenario where this is useful, is for IPv6 privacy addresses.
Privacy addresses are temporary, often with a default expiry time
of 4 hours. After this time, the address is removed from the system,
and TCP connections using that address will be terminated.
(See for example mumble-voip/mumble#1377)

One would naturally expect it to be possible to observe the fact
that the TCP connection has been terminated, but that doesn't seem
to be what's happening. At times, I've observed it taking up
to 30 minutes until my client realized that the connection wasn't
there anymore. (However, the server that I was connected to
found out immediately, and disconneted me.)

Because of this behavior, this TCP ping check was implemented."

GCC 4.1, used in our CentOS 5 buildenv doesn't know
the c++03 alias. Use c++98 instead.

This is completely safe, since there is no semantic
difference between -std=c++98 and -std=c++03.
GCC treats all of ""-std=c++98"", ""-std=c++03"" and
""-ansi"" as being equal. From the GCC docs:

  ""The original ISO C++ standard was published
   as the ISO standard (ISO/IEC 14882:1998) and
   amended by a Technical Corrigenda published
   in 2003 (ISO/IEC 14882:2003).

   These standards are referred to as C++98 and
   C++03, respectively. GCC implements the majority
   of C++98 (export is a notable exception) and most
   of the changes in C++03.

   To select this standard in GCC, use one of the
   options -ansi, -std=c++98, or -std=c++03 [...]""

This commit adds a new compatibility header for
loading QAtomicInts portably between all supported
Qt 4 and Qt 5 versions.

The compatibility matrix is as follows:

Qt 4's QAtomicInt has a conversion operator (operator int())
for loading the atomic value.

In Qt 5.0 through 5.2, operator int() is not present, replaced
with a load() method.

However, Qt 5.3 introduces support for operator int() once again.
This means that Qt >= 5.3 support both .load() and operator int().

To overcome this problem without littering our code
with preprocessor ifs for QT_VERSION, we're introducing
a function, QAtomicIntLoad, that will perform the appropriate
load operation on a given Qt version.

This new function lives in QAtomicIntCompare.h."

This is an offshoot of Debian bug #831184.
(See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=831184)

Basically, G++6 now defaults to C++11 (or greater) mode.
We haven't explicitly passed a C++ standard C(XX)FLAG, so
until now, we've built against the g++/clang's default, which
until now was C++98 or C++03.

Now, Mumble itself doesn't really care what C++ mode it's built in.
We build fine in C++11 mode.

However, on Debian/Ubuntu, libraries such as ZeroC Ice
provide separate C++11 and C++03 .so's with different ABIs.
The default version in system's lib dir is the C++03 version,
but the ABI that is targeted when building with ""g++ -lIce [...]""
(that is, without explicitly specifying a default C++ mode)
is the C++11 variant -- because G++6 defaults to C++11 mode.

This puts us in a situation where we have to *know* which C++
version we're built against, to be able to select the correct
Ice libraries on Debian/Ubuntu.

Debian's C++11 Ice libraries live in `/usr/lib/$TRIPLE/c++11`,
and the C++03 versions live in `/usr/lib/$TRIPLE/`.

(Actually, the C+11 libraries in `/usr/lib/$TRIPLE/c++11` are
symlinks to .so files in /usr/lib/$TRIPLE with a '++11'
suffix. Which makes sense: this way, /usr/lib/$TRIPLE/c++11 is
only a developer detail, and not part of the default library
search path of the system.)

This commit does a few things to patch things up:

 - We now explicitly pass a `-std=` flag to the compiler.
 - By default, we build with `-std=c++03`, but if
   CONFIG(c++11) is specified (either by being the default
   in modern Qt 5 versions, or explicitly via user action),
   we use `-std=c++11`.
 - When CONFIG(c++11) is specified, we ensure QMAKE_LIBDIR
   includes `/usr/lib/$TRIPLE/c++11` such that we link against
   the correct libraries.

Used place holder marks for PostgreSQL UPSERT values instead of positional binding since the statements require the values twice (once for the INSERT, and once for the UPDATE should the insert fail).
The values to use for the ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE part of the UPSERT have been prefixed with u_ .

This commit reverts to using REPLACE INTO for non-PostgreSQL databases and uses the same code for them as the upstream master mumble-voip/mumble.
Previously this branch used the same code for all databases. This commit uses if statements to treat PostgreSQL differently from other databases where it needs to use UPSERT instead of REPLACE INTO."

This adds a new QComboBox subclass called MUComboBox
to widgets/MUComboBox.{cpp,h}.

This QComboBox subclass explicitly uses a QListView
as the backing view for the QComboBox.

This fixes various styling issues for QComboBox
on macOS.

By default on macOS, QComboBoxes are backed by
something that tries to emulate a native macOS
menu. However, that QAbstractItemView behaves
inconsistently when styled. For example, it does
not seem possible to set the size of individual
items, because they're restricted to the height
of a normal macOS menu item.
Also, in some cases (such as the QComboBox used
for the transmission picker in MainWindow's
QToolbar),  the height of the QAbstractItemView
was also wrong when styled. This caused the combo
box to always scroll, even though it seemingly
was sized correctly.

To get consistent behavior, we use QListView as
the QComboBox's view in MUComboBox.

Also, at least for the default Mumble themes,
I've observed some weird eliding behavior for
the text of added items in the transmission picker
QComboBox in MainWindow's toolbar. Because of that,
for MUComboBox, we don't show ellipses by default.
This fixes the display of the combo box in the
MainWindow's toolbar."

Currently, Mumble has a restrictive message filter
that will filter away messages that are larger
than the screen. A filtered message is replaced with
the text ""Text object too large to display"".

This commit replaces the existing size filter.
Instead of using the screen size to determine
whether a message is too large to show, Mumble
now checks whether the area of the received
message exceeds 2048x2048.

For example, this will allow messages with
sizes such as 500x8388 or 1500x2796 -- or
simply 2048x2048. As long as the total area
of the rendered message does not exceed
2048x2048 -- in which case the
""Text object too large to display"" will
be displayed.

The Mumble client doesn't care, but it isn't very nice. It breaks things

To fix the problem, this change introduces a regString function that
converts a wchar_t string to QString. Any NUL value in the input

Querying the device list and checking whether IG_ is in the name does
not work on Windows 10 Anniversary Update (1607).

To work around that, we add the GUIDs for all Xbox One controllers.

This should fix the problem for the most common XInput devices for now.

Presumably, Microsoft will fix this later on. But for now, this will do.

The good thing about doing it this way is that it isn't a workaround per

This moves the manual plugin into Mumble itself.

First, it implements a new plugin interface, MumblePluginQt, that is
explicitly designed to allow widgets to ask for a parent QWidget when
showing its about/config dialog.
MumblePluginQt is an optional interface that can be implemented by
plugins, like manual, that require Qt functionality.

The manual plugin is modified to make use of MumblePluginQt.

Then, the manual plugin itself is moved from a shared library to being
built into Mumble itself.
It moves from plugins/manual/manual.{cpp,h,ui] to
src/mumble/ManualPlugin.{cpp,h,ui}.

The Plugins class is taught about built-in plugins, and manual in
particular. It's not a lot of code.

Finally, all the hacks required to use the manual plugin as a shared
library are removed.

The end result is that we get a manual plugin that works again, and we
save ~3.5MB in mumble_app.dll.

The machinery needed to support the ""manual"" plugin as a DLL
file on Windows is very complex.

This is because we build Mumble itself as mumble_app.dll and link
our dependencies statically. And also because of various changes
made in Qt 5.

The manual plugin uses Qt. When Mumble linked dynamically against
Qt4Gui.dll, etc. - everything worked fine. The manual plugin simply
linked against the same DLLs.

With the move to mumble_app.dll, we also moved to statically link
against Qt for mumble_app.dll.

To accommodate the manual plugin, we implemented various hacks to
export the Qt symbols from mumble_app.dll that were necessary for
loading the manual plugin.

And that worked for a while.

However, right now, with Qt 5.6, the plugin is broken. And I get
a lot of weird crashes when interacting with the manual plugin.

Most of it boils down to the fact that both manual.dll and mumble_app.dll
have copies of statically initialized data, like QArrayData::shared_null.
Sharing objects between mumble_app.dll and manual.dll in this scenario is
impossible, because using the object in one module will cause one set of
statically initialized data to be used, while use in the other will cause
the other data to be accessed. This is especially bad for things that use
reference counting, because it'll get out of sync.

So, to get rid of this mess, we're moving the manual plugin into Mumble
itself. Functionally, it doesn't change anything. The manual plugin could
not be auto-updated because it depended on a specific Qt and Mumble
version. Mostly because it depended on the correct set of Qt symbols to be
exported from mumble_app.dll.

The plugin now works correctly, and we can safely remove a lot of the
hacks that were required to load the manual plugin in its earlier
incarnation.

The only downside is that we can't test the manual plugin in PAHelper.
But that wasn't really the case before either, because the plugin
practically depended on Mumble to run."

If a plugin implements MumblePluginQt, it is a signal to Mumble
that the plugin wishes to use Qt-based about and config dialogs.

The MmublePluginQt interface includes two methods: ""about"" and
""config"".

Mumble will call these methods with a pointer to a QWidget that
is suitable to be the parent for the plugin's about and/or config
dialogs.

The MumblePluginQt interface is only useful for plugins that use Qt.
That, for now, is only the ""manual"" plugin. In general, plugins can't
really use Qt unless they're very tightly coupled to Mumble."

It seems that in EVE Online, if we update our overlay texture but do not
draw to the screen, the texture mapping is never freed, until we begin
drawing again.

I do not know enough D3D11 to know why.

Instead, this commit works around the issue by introducing a fully legal
optimization to the blit() method:

If the rect of active overlay elements is empty (that is, the screen is
empty), do not perform a blit at all.

The change also introduces an extra call to blit upon receiving
OVERLAY_MSG_ACTIVE. That message is the message that signals that
the rect of active elements has changed.
We need to blit here to ensure we redraw correctly once the rect
of active overlay elements changes.

Once all plugins have been transitioned over to the new explicit

In the old-style mumble_plugin_win32.h, PTR_TYPE
is set to 'void *', and PTR_TYPE_CONCRETE is
set to 'BYTE *'. The pModule varaible and the
getModuleAddr functions return PTR_TYPE_CONCRETE,

Our binaries are timestamped, and we expect them to be deemed
valid by Windows even after the certificate expires. And they
are.

However, our own code explicitly passes WTD_LIFETIME_SIGNING
to the WinTrust APIs, overriding Windows's default of treating
timestamped binaries as valid even after certificate expiry.
(As long as the certificate doesn't have the lifetime signing bit
set!)

From Windows Authenticode Portable Executable Signature Format [1]:

> Timestamp Processing with Lifetime Signing Semantics

> Applications or certification authorities that do not want timestamped

> two options:
>
>  - Set the lifetime signer OID in the publishers signing certificate.

>    If the publishers signing certificate contains the lifetime signer
>    OID in addition to the PKIX code signing OID, the signature becomes
>    invalid when the publishers signing certificate expires, even if

>
>  - Set the WTD_LIFETIME_SIGNING_FLAG in the WINTRUST_DATA structure

>
> If a WinVerifyTrust caller sets WTD_LIFETIME_SIGNING_FLAG in the

> If a publisher revokes a code signing certificate that contains the lifetime

> WINTRUST_DATA structure, WinVerifyTrust reports the signature as valid if both
> of the following conditions are met:
>
>  - The signature was timestamped before the revocation date.
>  - The signing certificate is still withinits validity period. After the

The previous code accidently used the
C-string ""host"" and ""serverID"" variables
in the JSON output for the context and
identity.

To avoid too many changes, this commit
changes the JSON escape function to
work on C strings instead, and uses
that to escape the ""host"" and ""serverID""
strings from the game before emitting
them into the JSON documents.

This commit also adds some extra code
to ensure that the game strings we
include in the JSON document are
within the printable ASCII range."

Thanks to @mrzchuck for answering system based programming questions
and helping me with my first use of github.

This plugin supports the latest version of L4D2 (version 2.1.4.5)

Most of my code changes are based on the mumble wiki plugin guide
styling and/or the Counter Strike (CS) plugin (both of which are more
standardized and easier to read). I removed the calcout function by
pulling in the front and top vectors directly from L4D2. I simplified
the trylock function by calling fetch from it (previously trylock and
fetch contained duplicate code). The style for context support seemed
convoluted so I changed it to emulate the style of the CS plugin (the
logic is still the same). Lastly, I added many helpful comments
describing the variables, functions, and general principles of mumble
plugins.

I have performed extensive testing and found excellent results."

My own rule of thumb for scripts in our repo is to keep the
number dependencies down. In practice, this means I always
strive to only use the standard library.

In this case, it's not that easy.

The existing code sorted sufficiently on Windows.

However, when run on Unix-like systems, it produces odd, and
to my mind, unexpected sorting behavior. (Such as ignoring spaces,
and sorting 'Hey You' after 'Heyh You'.)

I suppose the sort order is a matter of preference.

But the non-determinism of the script's output isn't.
If we don't fix this, we'll get noisy diffs once in a while,
which isn't very nice.

This commit changes the script to use 'pyuca' to
do the sorting. This is a pure Python module, so
it's easy to install via pip on all OSes."

I think there's a good excuse for this: we don't expose a user's password
hash over Ice, which is actually a pain in the backside for migrating
servers via Ice. So in the interests of consistency, I think it's probably
better to not expose the SSL private key or it's passphrase over Ice either,
particularly since SSL keys are a bit of a ""cat out the bag"" thing.

Note that at present, the SSL passphrase isn't exposed via meta either - the
""key"" field of meta.GetDefaultConf() contains a plaintext copy of the key,
but I left the check in anyway in case we change that for any reason.

When the user specifically requests things that ought to be secret over Ice,
we raise an exception rather than have it silently fail, to hopefully reduce
the amount of head-scratching some poor script writer has to do.

Finally, more or less do the same thing over D-Bus."

We've gotten reports of this for some years now, but haven't solved it in a good
way, yet.

Some notification daemons and/or desktop environments allow *some* HTML. Some don't.

The latest freedesktop.org notification specification [1] states that supporting
a HTML subset is optional, but servers that do not support the HTML subset should
filter them out.

From the reports we've received on the issue tracker for some time, it doesn't
seem like notification daemons are filtering out HTML in practice.

For example, in mumble-voip/mumble#1535, it is reported that Fedora's
(GNOME 3's?) notification daemon doesn't support the mumble:// URL scheme,
and shows raw HTML instead.

In mumble-voip/mumble#2211, it is reported that elementary OS's notification
daemon doesn't support HTML in notifications either.

So, until something changes, we'll just send plain text notifications
when using org.freedesktop.Notifications.

When spectating a player, Quake Live gets his data (in this case position and team values); this means that the team doesn't result as ""SPEC"" and Positional Audio works using his position values. This might be a feature because the spectator can hear the other players with PA, but the spectated player data is sent through him on Mumble and this causes much confusion."

There are two memory addresses: one with the obfuscated IP address and one with the true one. Initially I used the first one; when you join through the console it has the true IP address, but when you join through the server browser it shows the obfuscated one: this is a problem. I decided to use the second memory address, that always shows the true IP address.
Reason of the string change: I noticed that the second memory address uses ""loopback"" instead of ""localhost"" used by the first, when on a local server."

This change also removes the architecture
from the OSInfo string, since it is noisy.

The old code would always emit ""i386"", seemingly
since that's the ""lowest"" fatch arch that the current

I tried to update the code, but instead of x86_64, I
got ""x86_64h"", which is Apple's arch string for
Haswell chips.

I don't think it makes sense anymore to have the
architecture string in the OSInfo on OS X. All
Macs running the modern OSes are x86_64 anyway.

Mumble using a compiler that we had not anticipated being
used for building Mumble (a newer version of GCC, for
example).

Because of that, we disable warnings-as-errors by default.

Our own binary builds will, of course, enable it

The CI system will also always use it. That should

In addition, this commit also adds a new setting,
""tts/language"". This is a BCP 47-style language code
that TTS engines will attemp to adhere to.

I put it in, to allow users to still be able to use
an English TTS engine, while using Mumble in another

For now, ""tts/language"" is a hidden setting -- it has
no UI to configure it.

And touch up some of its code.

LuaMilkshake reports that it is possible to get
Murmur to emit HTML even when allowhtml is false.

For example via ""<br />&lt;b&gt;hello world&lt;/&gt;"",
which would be translated to ""\n<b>hello world</b>""
by the previous HTML filtering code.

Mumble uses QXmlStreamReader to get each token of
an XML document to sanitize it.
Unfortunately, QXmlStreamReader isn't just a tokenizer.
It has a lot of behind-the-scenes XML logic to handle
things such as entities.
Entities definitions are read and handled by the
QXmlStreamReader itself, and are not emitted to a
consumer of QXmlStreamReader. This means that when
QXmlStreamReader gives you a piece of 'text' data,
it will have already translated any entities in the
text and translated them accordingly.
This is why LuaMilkshake's example works.

It is seemingly not possible to get QXmlStreamReader
to avoid handling entities. But I believe we can at
least stop it from allow new entities to be defined.
The original code already did that -- by wrapping
the input XML in a new root tag ""<document>"". This
ensures that an internal DTD cannot be defined, and
thus that no new entities can be added.

This limits the number of entities we need to
handle, to the small list of default entities
defined by XML: &quot; &amp; &aps; &lt; &gt;.

To ensure that the HTML filter is at least a little
bit effective against these injection attacks, we
ammend the logic of the HTML filter to attmpt to
strip &lt; and &gt; *after* running it through
the original QXmlStreamReader-based filter.
This ensures that no additional HTML elements
can be added via entities."

The RPC/DBus-based method for ensuring that only a single instance of
Mumble is running is racy.

If one of the processes has started it's RPC listener, it works fine.
But if both processes are started at almost the same time, it's very
likely that neither process has started listening for RPC. And the
exclusivity check fails.

In order to be completely sure that only a single Mumble instance is
running, we now take a lock file.

The lock file logic is implemented in a new class, UserLockFile.

We open a lock file file in the data directory (for Windows, that's
%APPDATA%\Mumble). The file has sharing disabled, so as long as the
process that created the file is running, no other process can access
it.

If a second instance of Mumble is launched, and the file is inaccessible,
that instance terminates itself.

It is, of course, still possible to override the single instance
limitation by passing the '-m' flag to Mumble.

This simplifies our handling of our UI layout setting in
MainWindow.

Previously, we had slots that detected visibility and position
changes for dock elements. And if any of them fired, we would
revert back to the 'custom' layout.

However, changing the layout behind the user's back meant we
had to keep track of the original layout setting when we
performed a re-layout of the MainWindow, such as when we apply
new settings from the ConfigDialog.

In Qt 5 (we think!), things changed, and the slots are called
more frequently.

Currently, that means that Mumble *always* resets to the 'custom'
layout when applying settings. That's no good.

This commit removes the slots that listen for layout and visibility
changes for dock elements. It also removes MainWindow's 'dock widget'
context menu when not in the 'custom' layout. The result is that you
are now locked into the layout that you choose in the ConfigDialog.

We already have code in Mumble that I wrote a while back that disables
dragging of dock elements when you are not in the 'custom' layout.

This is a natural extension of that: you can no longer modify the
layout of the UI unless you choose 'custom'.

This commit adds native support for XInput to GlobalShortcut on Windows.

Most things XInput-related is named XboxInput in an attempt to reduce
confusion with X11's XInput.

This commit adds a new class, XboxInputLibrary, which is a thin wrapper
class for handling the XInput DLL.

XboxInput supports various versions of the XInput DLL, as well as
the non-public XInputGetStateEx function (ordinal 100) -- if it is
available in the loaded XInput DLL. XInputGetStateEx makes it possible to
query the state of the guide button, allowing it to be used as a global
shortcut in Mumble.

The most suitable GetState function is chosen by XboxInput and is
exposed simply via the GetState member variable.

This commit does nothing to prevent DirectInput from *also* getting input
from any connected Xbox controllers. However, no ill effects have been
observed yet.

For now, the result simply is that -- for the buttons that DirectInput
supports -- we get a button click from both engines. For example,
pressing A yields the equivalent of ""DirectInput:A + Xbox1:A"" as the
shortcut name, because both engines handled the button press.

In the future, we should blacklist the DirectInput device if XboxInput
is enabled to rule out any future incompatibilities.

The current implementation treats a shortcut from the first Xbox
controller as a different shortcut than the same button from a
potential second, third or fourth Xbox controller connected to
the system. As a result, if a button is bound on the first controller
in one session, Mumble will only respond if that button is pressed on
the first controller in future sessions.

This commit adds four flags to the ConnectDialog. One that allows
pings, one that allows system hostname lookups, one that allows
Bonjour host lookups, and one that allows the use of filters in
the ConnectDialog.

By default, they are all enabled.

However, if you're using a proxy, all will be disabled.

The commit also updates the ConnectDialog UI to hide
the user count and ping columns when pings are not enabled.
This is because it is generally not possible to ping via the
usual UDP mechanism when using Mumble through a proxy.

Also, since it is not possible to ping servers, the filters
that are usually available for the ConnectDialog are also
disabled. When using a proxy, all servers are shown.

As a consequence of this commit, Mumble will now allow you to
connect to a server for which a hostname has not yet been
resolved if you are using a proxy.

Previously, for hosts that could not be resolved via the regular
resolvers in Mumble (system resolver, Bonjour, ...), Mumble
would not be able to connect. This is because Mumble would disable
the Connect button if no hostname(s) could be resolved -- or were
not yet resolved.

With this commit, Mumble will now allow connections to those
hosts, and let the proxy will do the hostname resolving. This
allows, among other things, Mumble to connect to Tor .onion
hosts when using Tor as a proxy.

When AudioInput is configured to use more than a single frame per
packet, the ""!bPreviousVoice""-check in encodeOpusFrame() and
encodeCELTFrame() is not sufficient in determining when to reset
the encoder.

This is because bPreviousVoice refers to the previous *frame*.

But when AudioInput is configured to use multiple frames per
packet, we won't enter encodeOpusFrame() at the initial frame
where bPreviousVoice would be false.

The result is that we *never* reset the current encoder
when using more than one frame per packet.

This change adds a flag, bResetEncoder, to the AudioInput class.

Now, When AudioInput encounters a frame that is speech, and the
previous frame was not (bIsSpeech && !bPreviousVoice), it will
set the bResetEncoder flag.

The encoder is now reset correctly when a new voice stream begins,
just like it is for the single frame-per-packet case."

Effects11 is quite heavy, in that it pulls D3DCompiler_43.dll (x86)

Together, these two DLLs are ~6MB in size.

Also, the removal of the Effects11 library itself cuts the sizes of
the overlay DLLs by more than half:

  mumble_ol.dll with Effects11:         407 KB
  mumble_ol.dll without Effects11:      162 KB

Directly using the split shaders is just as easy, and uses less code than
using the Effects11 library. At least for our simple shaders.

This fixes the build on OS X.

Before this change, 3rdparty/celt-0.7.0-src/libcelt was marked

Which should be fine.

However, with the aforementioned directory being treated as
a system directory, clang would handle an include statement
such as

    #include <celt.h>

by first checking the non-system directories.

In this case, it would pick opus-src/celt/celt.h.

This lead to bad things happening, such as missing
preprocessor defines, and missing typedefs for CELT's
integer types.

To work around that, mark Opus's header locations as
system include directories as well, so they're ordered
correctly when doing #include."

This change removes our qmake-based Qt translation embedding.

That system uses mumble_qt.qrc resource file with
hardcoded filenames for Qt translations, and some logic
implemented in qmake that copies Qt translations into
the Mumble source tree such that the paths in the
mumble_qt.qrc file match.

The new system introduces a simple Python script that
takes an output filename for the .qrc file the tool
will write, along with a set of directories containing
Qt translations.

The tool will generate a Qt resource file containing
references to all the translation files found in the
specified directories. However, the tool takes care
to only include language files once.

In typical use, the first directory parameter passed
to the tool is the QT_INSTALL_TRANSLATIONS directory,
which is where Qt stores its own translation files.
The second directory is Mumble's fallback directory.

The tool then goes through all files in the first
directory, and notes down which languages have been
processed. Multiple files for a single langauge can
be included from the a directory (qt_help_da.qm,
and qtbase_da.qm), but once a language has been
added from one directory, it will not be added
if found in the next one in line.

We use this to include a set of 'fallback'
translations for versions of Qt that do not
include them. This also allows this new style
of Qt translation embedding to be forward
compatible with newer versions of Qt that
add new translations.

Once Qt includes a translation that we have
in our fallback directory, the Qt translation
is used instead."

This change removes the ""RCC Error:"" output that appears
when running ""qmake -recursive main.pro"".

The qmake tool's resources feature (resources.prf) invokes
""rcc -list <input>.qrc"" to determine which files to add as
dependencies for the rcc target (for the given <input>.qrc)
in the generated Makefile.

When invoking ""rcc -list [...]"" on some of our .qrc files,
we get errors, such as:

    RCC: Error in 'mumble.qrc': Cannot find file 'mumble_cs.qm'
    RCC: Error in 'mumble.qrc': Cannot find file 'mumble_da.qm'
    RCC: Error in 'mumble.qrc': Cannot find file 'mumble_de.qm'
    [...]

This is because our .qrc files include references to files
that are generated when we invoke the Makefile.

Unfortunately, the invocation of ""rcc -list [...]"" happens
during the qmake invocation, and not when running ""make"".
So the files simply do not exist yet.

This change replaces the qmake ""rcc"" extra compiler's
""depend_command"" to be a script we wrote ourselves, namely
rcc-depends.py, that lives in the scripts directory.

This script does practically the same thing as invoking
""rcc -list"", but it does not care if the files exist yet
or not. It expects that they do.

The result is that all files listed in a .qrc file are now
properly added as dependencies for the Makefile rule that
invokes rcc to process the .qrc file. This did not happen
before.

So, a positive side-effect of this change is that our
Makefile is now able to order things correctly itself,
even for auto-generated files in .qrc files. Before, we
had to give it hints. These hints are still in place,
such as:

    lrel.variable_out = rcc.depends

and

    copytrans.variable_out = rcc.depends

both from mumble.pro. These hints are used to order
the lrel and copytrans targets before rcc is invoked
in the generated Makefile. However, now that all files
are output as dependency information in the Makefile,
this should not strictly be necessary.

This change has been tested with both Qt 4 and Qt 5, on
Windows and Linux."

The fps position was already set up to save, the timer not.
Use storage names according to the show flags (""time"" rather than
""clock"").

The anchor (""handle"") and text-item are added to the scene as independant
objects to allow moving the anchor to the bottom/right, at which point
the item is prevented from bleeding over the edge (so a linked movement
of individual items with custom behavior at the right/bottom edge case).

Additional Notes:

Using relative values for positioning, the default values are best-effort
values. The space between the items (the top value of the FPS) will differ
between different screen/scene sizes.

The position is saved as a rectangle, even though a point would be enough.

Handling of visibility is sub-optimal, but works. (As we use two
independent, linked items, we have to implement our own setVisible
method, and currently only call in OverlayConfig (when using config
mode).

It looks like the overlaytext used to create a text pixmap could be
replaced by QGraphicsTextItem."

This change allows server admins to specify Diffie-Hellman
parameters for Murmur to use. This is done using the sslDHParams
option in the config file. Diffie-Hellman parameters can also be
set on a per-server basis using the sslDHParams option.

Note: the functionality implemented in this change requires the
QSslDiffieHellmanParameters class in Qt, which has not yet landed
upstream in the Qt 5 'dev' branch. This means that the functionality
discussed in this change will, for now, only work in binaries provided
by the Mumble project, or binaries that are built using our build
environments, and not binaries that link against any released versions
of Qt at present.

This change modifies the default TLS cipher suite string to add
EDH+aRSA+AESGCM, DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA and DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA.

This yields the following ciphers, in TLS/RFC notation:

    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

This change also allows Murmur servers to provide forward secrecy
to older clients, such as our own pre-built binaries before 1.2.9.

It also provides forward secrecy for users that use Mumble 1.2.x
versions on Linux distros, and other Unix-like systems. This is
because Mumble 1.2.x on Unix-like systems builds against Qt 4, which
limits the connection to TLS 1.0.

Lines starting with a hash are not considered to be comments!!

The QSettings() class has no formal support for comments. In fact,
there's no mention of comments at all in the class documentation:
http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsettings.html

There is some limited support for comments by denoting a line with a
semicolon. You can confirm this via the associated source code:
https://github.com/qtproject/qtbase/blob/5.6/src/corelib/io/qsettings.cpp

However, if saving the file via the Qt interfaces, comments will
generally be stripped out. This isn't to my knowledge a problem for
Murmur as there's no case where the server itself will update its
configuration and save the changes back to its INI file automatically.

The existing sample INI file prior to this commit only ever worked as
there's an even number of unescaped special characters in the header!"

The previous code triggered the restart of Mumble directly from
the ConfigDialog apply function by calling qApp->exit with the
magic exit code. This does not call the MainWindow closeEvent which
handles storing MainWindow geometry.

This patch moves the actual restart query and execution from the
ConfigDialog to the MainWindow. It is executed once the apply of
the ConfigDialog was run and triggers a restart if needed. To do
so the window has a new flag 'restartOnQuit' which the closeEvent
can pick up.

Mumble fails to restart itself when asked to do so from the configuration menu.

This is because we run with uiaccess=true resulting in the normal

error log: ""The process failed to handle ERROR_ELEVATION_REQUIRED

QProcess doesn't correctly consider windows permissions when performing
launch operations as can be seen in QTBUG-7645 so we have to work
around this ourselves. As we do not need full admin privileges and
do not want the user to be prompted use the ShellExecuteEx function

For some option changes a client restart is required
to fully apply the changes. This patch enabled Mumble
to restart itself. This is accomplished by adding a
special MUMBLE_EXIT_CODE_RESTART exit code that is
cought right before the application terminates. Mumble
then uses available session information to launch
another instance of itself right before it exits. As
this happens after the vast majority of cleanup multiple
client restrictions and other resource contention issues
do not come into play.

Launching another client deviates from the usually
recommended way of not exiting the process but simply
doing a re-initialization of the application after the
cleanup. With Mumble this is tricky as we have some
objects for which we do not control the lifetime after
we initialized them once and others might be managed
sloppily as the design never expected to have to
re-initialize. We should strive to clean up these
weaknesses in resource management but for now the
approach taken here works around them."

The default Boost installation paradigm for non-Unix boxes

manner, such that it simply lives in include/boost, instead of having
a version attached -- this is called a tagged installation, and
is triggered via 'b2 --layout=tagged'.

All of our build environments use tagged Boost installations, and thus
we can avoid the embedded versions now that we have transitioned to
using build environments from mumble-releng.

While we don't necessarily want to force the build environments
from mumble-releng on people, the versioned includes are a bad idea
in the first place, because they require constant maintenance.

This patch fixes dual-stack UDP on Windows as well as for unsual

TCP socket. Previously on systems where IPV6_V6ONLY was enabled
by default (e.g. Windows) we would incorrectly create an
IPv6 only socket even though our TCP socket and the system
are dual-stacked.

The dual-stack detection moved from Meta.h to Server.h into the
SslServer class where it is a better fit. Also modified the function
to instead of querying the value of IPV6_V6ONLY on a test socket
it now tries to actively disable it. While previously dual stack
support was only detected if it was the default configuration for
that system, it should now be detected in all cases. The function
also now performs the same check on Windows socket where the default
actually is to have IPV6_V6ONLY enabled."

This commit updates the Mumble installer to install all binaries except
mumble.exe into a ""versioned root"".

For example, a typical Mumble installation would look something like this
(rooted the install target, typically ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mumble""):

   /mumble.exe
   /Versions/1.3.0/mumble_app.dll
   /Versions/1.3.0/mumble_ol.dll
   /Versions/1.3.0/mumble_ol_x64.dll
   /Versions/1.3.0/mumble_ol_helper.exe
   /Versions/1.3.0/mumble_ol_helper_x64.exe
   /Versions/1.3.0/mumble-g15-helper.exe
   /Versions/1.3.0/[various runtime DLLs, D3DCompiler, MSVCRT, etc.]

This also changes the installer to disable use of the Windows restart
manager.

The Windows restart manager does not work too well when the Mumble
overlay is in use. In this case, the restart manager will prompt users
to restart all applications that the overlay is injected into.

Users see this as a big list of programs that they must close to
upgrade Mumble.

This can be very scary for anyone that does not know about the
inner workings of the Mumble overlay, and are new to Mumble.
It is an instant red flag for people, and they will associate
Mumble with malware, or be afraid that it will actually touch
anything in those programs and make them unusable in some fashion.

The combination of disabling the restart manager and the new
versioned directory hierarchy removes nearly all of the cases
where a user sees a ""file in use"" dialog when running the Mumble
installer.

The overlay DLLs will not trigger the ""files in use"" dialog anymore,
because upgrading to a newer version of Mumble will cause the new
overlay DLLs to be installed in a distinct directory.

The removal of the old overlay files will also not trigger the
""files in use"" dialog. Their removal will simply be scheduled
on the next restart of the computer.

This commit also includes a forceful termination of ""mumble.exe""
when performing an upgrade of the Mumble installation. This is done
because the removal of the restart manager functionality in the
installer unfortunately also removes the ability to have the restart
manager quit Mumble on upgrade.

With the implementation of the versioned directory hierarchy, there
is a problem with the placement of some of our dependencies, at least
when Mumble and Murmur are installed at the same time.

The ""murmur.exe"" executable expects dbghelp.dll, msvcr120.dll and
msvcp120.dll to be next to ""murmur.exe"". However, with this new
directory hierarchy for the client, those DLLs live in the versioned
root instead.

To remedy this, we include two copies of these dependencies. If Murmur
is not chosen during installation, only Mumble's copies are installed
in the versioned root. If Murmur is selected, the DLLs will also be
installed next to murmur.exe."

This commit adds a new method to MumbleSSL that returns Mumble's
preferred cipher suites represented in the OpenSSL cipher list format.

This commit does not hook up the function to anything. It merely
implements it.

Previously, Mumble relied on OpenSSL's default cipher suites. However,
that decision has increasingly turned out to be unwise. Often, new TLS
vulnerabilities require server admins and users to be able to change the
cipher suites advertised by their software to help mitigate the damage.
This was not previously possible in Mumble.

The other thing that prompted this change is the Logjam TLS vulnerablity
(https://weakdh.org/, CVE-2015-4000). Mumble is not vulnerable to Logjam,
because Mumble has never allowed export grade DH groups. However, one of
the other key takeaways from the Logjam paper, ""Imperfect Forward Secrecy:
How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice"", is that the Internet community
should move towards DH groups bigger than 1024 bits, and preferably use
unique groups on a per-server basis. Unfortunately, neither of these two
solutions are possible with API that Qt provides for TLS.

To remedy this, we instead drop support for non-Elliptic Curve DH
in the default cipher configuration. We don't have any legacy clients
to support that can only use DH, so this is fine.

The OpenSSL cipher list in MumbleSSL::defaultOpenSSLCipherString()
evaluates to the following set of cipher suites, in order of preference:

  ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384    (TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)
  ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384  (TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)
  ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256    (TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256)
  ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256  (TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256)
  AES256-SHA                     (TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA)
  AES128-SHA                     (TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA)

The CBC-mode cipher suites are included for backwards compatibility with
older 1.2.x Mumble clients and other implementations that only use
TLSv1.0."

Before this commit, Mumble indiscriminately attenuates applications.
A simple example: it would attenuate applications that were set to output
to HDMI -- something that wasn't always desirable. My HDMI wouldn't need
to be attenuated because I am able to physically distinguish between sound
coming from either my HDMI or my laptop and ""tune in"" accordingly.

A more advanced use case is my PulseAudio streaming setup. I create two
additional sinks: ""stream"" and ""stream_spkr."" The ""stream"" sink is used
when I want to send audio from an application to my stream but not to
my speakers/headset (i.e., background music or something). In this case,
before this commit Mumble would attenuate my program playing the
background music. If I am running Mumble off-stream (which I often am),
this leads the background music volume fluctuating for seemingly no reason.

The second sink, ""stream_spkr"" routes both to ""stream"" and my
speakers/headset via two module-loopbacks. In this way, anything I attach
to stream_spkr can be heard both by my viewers and myself.

The option to include attenuation on loopback modules is for advanced
configurations. Loopback modules are used to route audio, usually between
a sink monitor and a sink. Sometimes it might be beneficial to attenuate a
loopback module that goes into Mumble's sink. Sometimes, however it's
inconvenient such as in the case where a user moves an application to
another sink that uses a loopback to Mumble's sink in order to specifically
have Mumble ignore attenuation on that application. But, if the loopback
that carries the non-Mumble sink's audio back to Mumble's sink is attenuated
then there would still be indirect attenuation of that application. In my
configuration, an example is the loopback from stream_spkr.monitor to the
physical speakers.

Only PulseAusio is supported in this patch, but this functionality could
potentially be extended to other audio systems."

This commit fixes an issue caused by a new behavior in Qt 5.4.1 that
causes
PWD to be included in the default INCLUDEPATH on Windows with the nmake/VS
generators.

This new behavior was implemented in the following Qt commit:
qtbase/a90bb5b89a - centralize/unify/sanitize INCLUDEPATH ""enrichment"")
https://github.com/qtproject/qtbase/commit/a90bb5b89a09490a1795064133f6d8ce33b6874e

This is a problem because our codecs in 3rdparty use two distinct
config.h files: one for Win32, and one for everything else.

The Win32 variant lives in the Win32 subdirectory of the build root.
The build root is the directory that will be added automatically by
the new Qt behavior. Typically, the build root has a build suffix,
for example 'speex-build'.

The regular config.h - the one for everything else but Win32 - lives
in the buildroot itself.

This new Qt behavior caused the wrong config.h file to be included
on Windows. Since the build root is now in the INCLUDEPATH,
the config.h file that lives in the build root now takes precedence
over the one in the Win32 directory.

To restore the old behavior for the codec builds, we use Qt config
option called 'no_include_pwd'. That explicitly tells qmake to not
include the PWD in the INCLUDEPATH. This restores the previous
behavior on Windows.

The 'no_include_pwd' config option has been around in Qt for a while.
It was not introduced with the aforementioned change to Qt, so it
doesn't break backwards compatibility for us."

QSsl::TlsV1_0OrLater, QSsl::TlsV1_1OrLater and QSsl::TlsV1_2OrLater
enums to QSsl.

Before this, we had a patch in our Qt 5.4 build (on Windows), that
changed the meaning of QSsl::TlsV1_0 to mean ""TLSv1.0 or later"".
However, that approach wouldn't work in the real world (some setups
require very specific TLS versions), so it was dropped in favour of
the TlsV1_0OrLater and friends.

Since our patch is in Qt 5.5, it means that we now can use
QSsl::TlsV1_0OrLater in the Mumble tree (ifdef'd to QT_VERSION
>= 0x050500), and not break anything for distros.

For Qt 5.4, we can rely on QSsl::SecureProtocols, because Qt 5.4
deprecated SSLv3. Thus, in Qt 5.4, QSsl::SecureProtocols means the
same thing as TlsV1_0OrLater means in Qt 5.5.

Why do we need TlsV1_0OrLater and friends if we have
QSsl::SecureProtocols? Because we don't have a guarantee that
QSsl::SecureProtocols will keep having TLSv1.0 as its minimum
version. The current Mumble protocol requires TLS 1.0.

If something comes up in the future that makes us abandon TLSv1.0,
we'll still handshake it. Rejection can happen at the Mumble protocol
level instead, providing a better user experience."

PulseAudio automatically creates monitors for devices.
These devices were previously explicitly excluded from the
list of input devices by Mumble. Excluding these devices
blocks people from combining multiple streams into Mumble
via PulseAudio.

One possible scenario is listed below:

 Requirement:
  - One wants to combine headset input and sound output
    of a script into mumble.

 Solution:
  - With PulseAudio one creates a virtual sink. Let's
    call it ""vscrd1"".
  - The headset's input is looped to ""vscrd1"".
  - The script's audio output is directly directed to
    ""vscrd1"".
  - Mumble is configured to use the input device
    ""vscrd1.monitor""

Now one can talk and send sound to Mumble at the same time.
It also helps much when using sound bots (music etc.)."

This commit removes macx/overlay and merges
the OS X overlay into the Unix overlay in
overlay_gl.

Most of the overlay logic is exactly the same,
with most of the differences being in the
initialization code and the addition of few new
messages for the interactive client-in-overlay
feature that the OS X overlay suports.

The initialization code is factored out into
init_unix.c for Unix-likes and init_mac.c
for OS X.

These init files are #included by overlay.c.
That is, they're not separate translation
units. Doing it this way cuts down on the
total LOC count and overall complexity of the
code.

The interactive overlay support is ported
directly from the OS X overlay. It's mostly
a matter of supporting a few new message types:
OVERLAY_MSGTYPE_PID and OVERLAY_MSGTYPE_INTERACTIVE.

The overlay_gl.pro file in this commit is mostly
just a combination of the .pro files of the two
overlays, with a minor difference in the CFLAGS
for the OS X overlay. In old OS X overlay, the
overlay had an "".m"" file extension, signalling
that it is an Objective-C source file to the
C compiler. Since the combined overlay has a
"".c"" extension, ""-x objective-c"" is added to
CFLAGS on OS X to tell the compiler to compile
the overlay as Objective-C code."

* Remove GL function resolution of not used functions
* Remove unused SwapBuffer function hooks:

TL;DR: SwapBuffers calls wglSwapBuffers, so we do not need to hook it,
and wglSwapLayerBuffers is for layer planes, which are optional and of
arbitrary number and index - so we never use that to hook/draw.

In detail:

SwapBuffers is actually a function of Gdi32.dll, and the one
youre supposed to use on windows (MSDN [1]), at least when
statically linking.
The wgl functions are used when dynamically linking.

See OpenGL Windows FAQ [2]

* 5.210 How do I properly use WGL functions?

Quoted from [3]

wglSwapLayerBuffers is the swap function for layer planes Overlay, Underlay,
and Main Planes. [4]

So using wglSwapBuffers is always enough.
We could draw on other layers, but if hooking into wglSwapLayerBuffers we
would have to know which layer to draw on, and either call it from
wglSwapBuffers or not, depending on the original program rendering that
layer, so thats not feasible.

In ET:L, for every logged GDI SwapBuffers call, a wglSwapBuffers call follows.

This changes Mumble on Windows to run a helper process,
mumble_ol.exe, instead of loading mumble_ol.dll itself.

Prior to this change, Mumble would load mumble_ol.dll and
call PrepareD3D9() and PrepareDXGI() to set up the overlay.
Then, if the overlay was enabled, it would call InstallHooks()
to enable automatic injection of the overlay into new processes.
Similarly, it would call RemoveHooks() to disable automatic
overlay injection when the overlay was disabled in Mmuble.

With this change, Mumble instead runs a helper process called
mumble_ol.exe. This process sets up the overlay (equivalent
to calling PrepareD3D9(), PrepareDXGI() and calling InstallHooks()).
While running, it'll automatically inject the overlay into new
processes, just like Mumble itself did previously. On normal exit,
the helper process calls RemoveHooks() to ensure automatic overlay
injection is disabled.

To enable the overlay, Mumble starts the helper process.
To disable the overlay, Mumble terminates the helper process.
If the helper process dies when it is supposed to be running,
Mumble restarts it to ensure that overlay injection keeps
working as intended.

This change is the first part of enabling both an x86 and an x64
overlay to be active in Mumble at the same time. Since we cannot
load a 32-bit DLL into a 64-bit process (or vice versa), we need
a helper process for each architecture to reach our goal.
Note however that this commit in itself does not make it possible
for Mumble to run both an x86 and an x64 overlay at the same time.
This will come later."

This commit adds MinHook as a 3rd party

This new MinHook-based HardHook implementation
allows us to provide an overlay for Mumble on
Windows x64.

The x64 overlay hasn't seen much testing in
real-world x64 games, except some minor testing
for World of Warcraft running in x64 mode, where
it works just fine.

There seems to be a compatibility with the Uplay
overlay, which causes Far Cry 4 to crash at the
""Press any key to continue"" screen that is shown
just after launching the game. However,
Assassin's Creed: Unity works fine, so it might
just be a Far Cry 4 issue.

The x64 overlay also seems to interoperate with
the Steam overlay just fine.

I think this is a good starting point for the
feature. Let us get it into snapshots and let
us try to squash any addition bugs we find."

This changeset makes the following modifications:

 1. The overlay DLL is changed to always consider the built-in blacklist,
    even if a blacklist is present in the registry.
    For Mumble users who have been running with the old blacklist behavior,
    this means that we'll be doing some duplicate checking for blacklist
    entries, but I don't think this matters in practice.

 2. Settings.cpp is changed to not do anything with overlay_blacklist.h.
    Effectively, this means that qslBlacklist now represents the items
    the user has added to the blacklist, and not the combination of both
    an outdated built-in list and the user's own entries.

 3. OverlayConfig.cpp is changed to always show all entries from
    overlay_blacklist.h. Entries from the built-in list are 'disabled',
    so they can't be interacted with.

Qt allows setting custom QPROPERTY values from QSS themes. As we cannot
style QPalettes this class has a property for each color group and
color role in a palette and acts as a stand-in for QApplication::palette
in the theme. When setting a qproperty-<group>-<role> on it in QSS
the brush will be set on the application palette.

The ApplicationPalette is derived from QWidget but never visible.
It listens to style changes on itself as those indicate the
application palette should be updated again. Variables not set
in the QSS will not be touched in the palette.

There might be some interactions with system style or theme changes
that have not yet been explored. Those are edge cases though and
can be fixed later.

ApplicationPalette.h is generated from ApplicationPaletteTemplate.h using
the generate-ApplicationPalette-class.py script. While it isn't expected
that this file has to change a lot in the future auto-generation is much
easier than writing all that boilerplate from hand.

This is a fix for the OpenGL overlay which disables

the arrays enabled between frames, which I think
(not an OpenGL expert) causes the input to the vertex
shader to essentially be arbitrary."

Apparently Qt 5 changed QTime's behavior with regards to invalidity.
A default constructed QTime is midnight time and invalid. We added
some milliseconds and converted to string. Both Qt 4 and 5 docs state
that an invalid time will yield an empty string. In Qt 4 however our
use did give us the time string we wanted instead of an empty string.
This patch simply removes the use of the default constructor in favor
of manually creating a valid midnight QTime to work with.

The SampleFormat enums in AudioOutput and AudioInput are meant to be

they're marked protected.

PulseAudioSystem has used these protected enums for some time, without
triggering any warnings. However, recent versions of Clang error out
on this behavior (and rightly so).

To fix this issue, this change modifies PulseAudioSystem to access the
SampleFormat enums via PulseAudioOutput and PulseAudioInput, instead
of going through AudioOutput and AudioInput directly. PulseAudioSystem
is already a friend class of PulseAudioOutput and PulseAudioInput, so
it can access the protected members of AudioOutput of AudioInput just
fine, as long as it happens via PulseAudioOutput and PulseAudioInput.

Qt's SVG image plugin is not safe to use with potentially
unsafe SVGs, such as those downloaded over the network.

More specifically, it is possible to trigger local file
access via Qt's SVG renderer using SVG features such as XML
stylesheets (XSL) and SVG image tags, and potentially other
features. This allows an attacker to have Qt read arbitrary
files into the memory space of the Mumble process.

This makes it easy to perform a Denial of Service attack
against a Mumble client. A client DoS can be accomplished
by serving it an SVG file that refers to a filesystem path
that is un-ending or is known to block under certain
circumstances.

Having arbitrary files read into the Mumble process could
potentially also be abused by an attacker to gain access
to the content of the files, if combined with an (as of
yet unknown) vulnerability that allows the attacker to
read Mumble's memory.

To fix the issue, this change removes SVG as a supported
image format for all externally received images. This
includes things such as text messages, user comments,
channel comments and user textures/avatars. It also removes
the ability to transmit SVGs using any of the aforementioned
channels.

This is accomplished by introducing a new class called
RichTextImage. The RichTextImage class is used, via its
isValidImage() method, to validate images before they are used
in a rich text context in Mumble. In its current form, the
isValidImage() method simply checks whether the image's format
is part of the set of image formats that are deemed safe
(PNG, JPG, GIF).

The LogDocument class, which is the QTextDocument that backs
the Mumble log view, undergoes the following changes:

 - LogDocument now restricts images loaded via QNetworkRequest
   and QNetworkReply to those that pass the
   RichTextImage::isValidImage() check.
 - Resources that use the data:// scheme are now loaded via
   QNetworkRequest and QNetworkReply, just like http:// and
   https:// URLs. This allows all resources to make use of
   LogDocument's new image format restrictions.
 - The functionality of the ValidDocument class, a subclass
   of LogDocument that was used to validate HTML snippets,
   is now part of LogDocument itself. The original
   ValidDocument class has been removed.

The RichTextEditor class is used to author text messages
and user comments. The RichTextEditor is changed to use
a LogDocument instead of a regular QTextDocument as its
backing document. This allows the RichTextEditor to benefit
from LogDocument's new image filtering functionality.

The static method Log::validHtml is used to validate
HTML before using it in various contexts such as the Mumble
log view and tooltips. This method is modified to use the
LogDocument class instead of the ValidDocument class.
A call to documentLayout() on the LogDocument is also
added to the method. This ensures that image loading
(and thus validation) is performed.

The MainWindow::openImageFile() method is re-worked to
sniff and validate a selected image using
RichTextImage::isValidImage to ensure that only valid
rich text images can be selected, regardless of file
extension.

The Overlay::verifyTexture() method is used to verify and
set a ClientUser's texture and texture format, either by
reading it from the local cache, or by reqesting a new
texture from the server. This method is changed to only
verify and set textures that pass the
RichTextImage::isValidImage() check.

The ServerHandler::setUserTexture() method (also known as
ServerHandler::setTexture() in some 1.2.x versions of Mumble)
is changed to only allow settings textures that pass the
RichTextImage::isValidImage() check.

Thanks to Tim Cooper for reporting this issue, proposing an
initial patch and reviewing the final patch. This commit has
also been reviewed and iterated upon by Stefan Hacker."

This commit fixes a regression in Mumble's auto-reconnect
functionality which made clients auto-reconnect to a server
even after being kicked or banned. Historically, Mumble has
not worked this way.

The new auto-reconnect behavior showed itself due to a bug fix in Qt
(Qt 4 commit: 488cb66, Qt 5 commit: e145b67).

The Qt change fixes QSslSocket such that a remote close (at the TLS
level) properly emits a QAbstractSocket::RemoteHostClosedError error.

Prior to this change, Mumble would simply treat a TLS-level remote
close as a client-initiated disconnect, and therefore not attempt to
auto-reconnect.

With this new and correct QSslSocket behavior in place, Mumble's
previous handling of auto-reconnect is insufficient. Since a kick/ban
now results in a TLS-level remote close, the client has no way to
determine whether a given remote close error is due to a kick/ban,
or due to the server shutting down. Note that a server shutdown has
always, even before this change, emitted a
QAbstractSocket::RemoteHostClosedError error. This is seemingly because
a server shutdown closes the underlying TCP socket instead of sending
a TLS-level close notification.

To fix the situation, this commit adds a flag to MainWindow that
signals whether the client should try to attempt an automatic
reconnect if it gets disconnected. When the client is kicked or banned,
this flag unset. This restores Mumble's previous auto-reconnect behavior
when kicked or banned from a server.

Fixes #1189"

We could have overloaded the meaning of the 'name' attribute, and
have passed the absolute path in there, but the chosen approach
is more explicit about its intentions.

Being explicit about the 'path' attribute also makes it easier to
understand how backwards compatibility is handled: Since Mumble 1.2.5
and prior verisons do not know about the 'path' attribute, they will
keep simply using the 'name' attribute as their pointer to the DLL
file. This means we'll have to keep serving the DLLs for these older
clients at <webroot>/plugins/<name>.

In practice, this means that all plugins that can be requested by
these older clients will need to have a copy that lives at
<webroot>/plugins/<name>. Since these clients only support
(abi=1600, os=Win32) we can ensure on the backend that plugins for
that combo are served at /plugins/<name>."

In Xcode 5, the xcrun tool includes a --show-sdk-path parameter
which, as the name implies, can be used to query the system for
a usable OS X SDK path. However, xcrun in Xcode 4 does *not*
include this parameter.

We used this parameter unconditionally, which lead to failures
when using building against Qt 4 when using Xcode 4.

This change modifies the SDK selection code to first attempt to
query for the OS X sdk using the --show-sdk-path parameter. If
that fails, we try to fall back to using a 10.8 SDK living in
a DEVELOPER_DIR found via xcode-select --print-path. If that
doesn't exist either, we warn the user and abort the build.

This should allow people to build Mumble on most systems without
having to resort to manual .pro file editing."

Furthermore, Mumble's User Information dialog and Murmur have been
modified to use this new method when displaying OS version strings
to users.

On Windows, the new method returns the full product version of the
OS, such as ""Windows 8 Pro"" (as opposed to 6.2.9200, which is the
equivalent result of the getOSVersion() method).

There are places in Mumble where the original ""simple"" version
string is required for compatibility or aesthetic reasons, such
as statistics and Mumble's HTTP user agent. Those places keep
the older version (by keeping their calls to the original
getOSVersion() instead of switching to the ""displayable"" variant).

It might seem overkill to jump through hoops to be able to show the
full product version, but it can be helpful for, say, server admins
to have access to the full product version if they need to

createSharedDataMap can fail to map the shared data used by other
functionality in the overlay dll. In this case pointers including
""sd"" remain NULLd. With the recent overlay changes the modified
shared data structures changed, triggering this case when running
different versions. This crashed Mumble on startup due to an
unchecked dereference of the ""sd"" pointer.

Also when extracting createSharedDataMap during refactoring behavior
was changed. The overlay kept injecting itself even if the mapping
failed. This also addresses this by making createSharedDataMap return
a bool indicating success or failure."

When Mumble was built as the mumble.exe/mumble_app.dll pair, mumble_ol.dll's
overlay self-detection logic didn't work, because it failed to find the
special ""mumbleSelfDetection"" symbol.

This change adds that symbol to mumble_exe. It is perhaps not the cleanest
solution to the problem, but doing it this way allows older mumble_ol.dlls
to continue to work with mumble_app.dll builds, and we avoid changing the
overlay self-detection check in mumble_ol.dll.

  id which works between servers and with duplicate channel names.
  The digest should be replaced by proper server identification soon.
  Ideally the client should keep a list which identifies servers

With this change, CONFIG(static) on Windows will cause the Mumble client's
application logic to be built into a .DLL called mumble_app.dll
(based on pcgod's previous DLL changeset).

Since src/mumble will now be built as a DLL, a wrapper executable is available
in src/mumble_exe. This wrapper is currently implemented such that it will
load mumble_app.dll from the directory that it resides in.

This means that when building statically, src/mumble and src/mumble_exe will
now give us the following products:

  src/mumble:      mumble_app.dll
  src/mumble_exe:  mumble.exe

Along with the two major points above, this change also adds a Python script
to the build, 'gen-mumble_app-qt-def.py', whose job is to construct a module
definition (.def) file for mumble_app.dll. The generated module definition
lists the Qt symbols that are needed for the manual positioning plugin to work.

If we need to expose more symbols in the future (say we want to implement
more plugin kinds than the current positional audio plugins), we now have
the infrastructure in place to do that."

Using a QueuedConnection for the slot had the unpleasant
side effect that the QSocketNotifier could have its activated()
slot invoked even though no data was waiting to be read.

In our case, this could cause a deadlock inside Avahi's
libdns_sd compatibility library.

I've settled on using Qt::AutoConnection to be consitent
with the rest of the code base. The Bonjour code should
always be invoked from the main thread, so in this case
Qt::AutoConnection will always mean Qt::DirectConnection.

Why does this happen?  Qt seems to process events before
invoking queued slot invocations.  If the Qt event loop
finds that the file descriptor that our QSocketNotifier
is providing notification for is ready for reading, it
queues up an invocation of the activated() slot for the
next event loop iteration (because we use a QueuedConnection).

As mentioned above, because Qt seems to poll() FDs before
invoking queued-up slots, the end result is that an
invocation of the activated() slot for a given
QSocketNotifier's file descriptor can be queued up in
the very same event loop iteration that a read() is
performed for the exact same file descriptor.

After performing the read(), the queued-up activated()
slot invocation is no longer valid, and can wreak havoc,
which in our case causes a deadlock in the Avahi libdns_sd
code.

The flow below describes the event loop iterations
in more detail:

1st event loop iteration
------------------------
* poll() is invoked; the QSocketNotifier's FD is
  ready for reading.
* An invocation of the activated() slot is queued
  up, to be executed next time we enter the event
  loop (due to Qt::QueuedConnection).

2nd event loop iteration
------------------------
* poll() is invoked; the QSocketNotifier's FD is
  _still_ ready for reading.
* An invocation of the activated() slot is again
  queued up, to be executed in the 3rd iteration.
* The queued-up slot invocation from the 1st iteration
  is invoked. (read() is called.)

3rd event loop iteration
------------------------
* poll is invoked(); the QSocketNotifier's FD has
  nothing to read anymore. Everything was read in
  the activated() slot that was invoked in the
  2nd iteration.
* The queued-up slot invocation from the 2nd iteration
  is invoked. This time, the read() syscall will block,
  because there is nothing to read."

mkrautz,2013-05-31 18:48:38,https://api.github.com/repos/mumble-voip/mumble/git/commits/aab9cdcce4e4c9c8a0656ce980aecc02745801ef,aab9cdcce4e4c9c8a0656ce980aecc02745801ef,"Server::sendMessage: encode the source IP of outgoing UDP packets to match the UDP socket's address family.

Murmur uses the saiTcpLocalAddress field of ServerUser to determine
the correct source address of outgoing UDP packets. On some systems,
such as multi-homed setups, this is important for correct datagram
delivery.

The saiTcpLocalAddress field is initialized when the client first
connects. Its value is extracted from QHostAddress, and then
converted to a sockaddr struct via our own HostAddress class's
toSockAddr method.

HostAddress::toSockAddr is implemented such that any IPv4 address
(including IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses) will always cause a sockaddr
struct belonging to the AF_INET (IPv4) family to be output. Pure IPv6
addresses will be output as an AF_INET6 sockaddr.

The code that this change touches assumed that it could use the
value of saiTcpLocalAddress directly as the source address in UDP
packets.

This is not always the case. On most systems, Murmur will listen on
[::]:64738 by default, and as such, the address of the server's UDP
socket will be in the AF_INET6 family. Attempting to send packets
with a source address in the AF_INET family using that socket will
cause sendmsg() to return EINVAL on some systems, if not all.

The new code for the sendmsg() code path converts the ServerUser's
saiTcpLocalAddress back into a HostAddress, which, internally, is
fully IPv6. If the input address is IPv4, HostAddress will convert
it to an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.

When the client's UDP socket is of the AF_INET6 family, we can now
trust that the HostAddress, 'tcpha', is either a real IPv6 address,
or an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. This allows us to use the 'tcpha'
address regardless of the address family of the saiTcpLocalAddress.
We can simply memcpy it in place.

When the UDP socket is of the AF_INET family, we can only set the
source address if the saiTcpLocalAddress is also AF_INET, or if
it is of the AF_INET6 family and its address is an IPv4-mapped IPv6
address. When a pure IPv6 address is encountered in that path, it is
simply dropped."

This change switches GlobalShortcutWin over to a slightly different model
in an attempt to combat the WinHook timeouts users have been reporting.

Previously, the DirectInput poller and the WinHooks event handling lived in
the same high-priority thread, and both of them processed all incoming button
events. Since both of them processed all events and emitted them using
GlobalShortcutEngine's handleButton method, they had to live in the same
thread in order for us to control the order of the signal dispatch.

Having the WinHooks live in the same thread as the DirectInput polling meant
that the hooks could potentially be blocked every 20 ms by the DirectInput
poller's timer event, which wasn't really desirable.

This new model splits up the DirectInput poller and the WinHooks event handling
into two separate, high-priority threads, each with different responsibilities.

The DirectInput poller is now the main source of events. This is where the actual
global shortcut presses are handled. Having DirectInput responsible for all
global shortcut buttonUp and buttonDown events allows us to use the WinHooks
thread *just* for filtering suppressed keys.

This design allows our WinHooks to have their own thread and event loop, meaning
they won't have to fight the DirectInput polling timer. Also, since the WinHooks
now have a more restricted set of tasks, they're able to do less work, hopefully
making it harder to trigger a timeout."

    information.

    elements like the FPS counter.

however be scaled to fit a bounding height, while preserving the
baseline to avoid breaking the regular layout."

Revert ""Remove deprecated WoW plugin.""

This reverts commit 8c197b374e8e34875b883e22d097d44705c4666c.

Updated WoW plugin to WoW 3.2.2. Attaches to process, returns sane values in test program. Attaches to process and activates positional audio in mumble, but has not influence to audio but make the sound softer as if both actors are >15m from each other. (which they where not in out tests)

translate wow coordinate system to right handed coordinate system add resync after stuck coordinates (maybe needed, could realiably reproduce) add realm as context

add more checks for sane values add utility functions for memory reading add identity reading

add camera reading instead of copied avatar"
