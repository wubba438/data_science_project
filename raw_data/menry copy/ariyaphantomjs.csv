The principal value of this test harness is its support for asynchronous
tests -- that is, tests where you have to wait for a callback to happen
before you can continue testing.  This applies to every test in our
testsuite that uses WebPage.open(), and some others as well.  With this
harness, the test suite is significantly faster and can be made race-free.

The API is not exactly the same as W3C testharness.js -- important
differences include: test execution is serialized within a file; ""file is
test"" mode has been removed, as we do not need it and it adds significant
complexity; several additional assertions have been added; the ability to
mark tests as expected to fail, or as to be skipped entirely, has been added.

New-style tests can opt out of testharness.js with a ""no-harness""
directive at the top of the file; this is necessary for a small number
of tests (e.g. basics/exit.js) that test functionality the harness
reserves for its own use.

All existing new-style tests have been converted to testharness.js; some
groups of tests have been consolidated into fewer files.  The naming
convention for tests in regression/ is clarified.

 * Support and use multi-level wildcards in TESTS.  This means we don't

 * Handle HTTP server errors during a test more gracefully.  Errors caused by
   the client disconnecting in the middle of a query-response transaction are
   ignored.  Other errors are reported and the test suite exits cleanly.
 * Add HTTPS and POST support to test server.
 * Add ability to run PhantomJS under a debugger on a test case.
 * Use argparse for command line parsing.
 * Accept -v as short for --verbose.
 * Repeating -v means more verbosity; at -vvv, phantomjs command lines are

   happen later.)
 * Fix bug where, with one or more -v, the pjs version number was printed

Rather than add all the special URLs we'll ever want to run-tests.py,
the embedded HTTP server now supports scripts in test/www/.  If you
try to load http://localhost:9180/path and test/www/path doesn't exist
but test/www/path.py does, then test/www/path.py is loaded as a module.
That module must export one function, handle_request(), which is called
to produce the response.

handle_request() has the same semantics as
SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.send_head().  That is, it takes one argument,
the SimpleHTTPRequestHandler object, conventionally named 'req'.
It should call the send_response(), send_header(), and end_headers()
methods of that object as appropriate.  And it should return a readable
filelike whose contents are taken as the body of the response.

If either module import or handle_request() throws any exception, the
HTTP response will be a 500 Internal Server Error with body provided
by cgitb.

We already have 'base_path' as a global variable, so use that (or rather,
a new derivative of that) instead of inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe()).

Rather than splitting the path and then iterating over every component
trying to figure out if it's ""special"", take advantage of the fact that
posixpath.normpath() will reliably produce a path with all ../ and bare-/
components at the very beginning.  Preserve the distinction between paths
with and without a trailing /, as SimpleHTTPRequestHandler expects.

So that paths containing unusual (e.g. non-ASCII, non-UTF-8) segments can
safely be tested, unquote and then requote the entire path.  This means
that the *bytes* corresponding to the ASCII characters

  0123456789 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz -_./

are guaranteed to be unquoted, and all other *bytes* are guaranteed to be
%-quoted.  (Note especially that *whether or not* the tests are being run
on Windows, \ in the original URL will be represented as %5C, and will
*not* be treated as a pathname separator.)

So that the tests behave consistently whether or not the OS has a case-
sensitive filesystem, after the above transformation, lowercase the entire
path.

This means that there is no longer a need to add every individual test

can be added just by dropping .js files into appropriate directories.

- Ensure we have a first cell to measure when checking required table

- Handle page break edge case with exactly fitting last table row
  In the case where the last table row on a page fitted exactly no
  extra offset was afforded to the next row. This resulted in no
  space being left for the painting of the table header on the next
  page.
- Fix segfault when checking heights for pagination if table body does
  not have a cell at 0,0

The [IO/A spec][1] for `read` is as follows:

> Read up to n bytes from the stream, or until the end of the stream
> has been reached. [If] n is null, reads up to the block size of the
> underlying device, or up to 1024 bytes if the block size is not
> discernible. If n is not specified, this method always reads the
> full stream until its end is reached. ...

Since discovering the block size of the underlying device is
non-trivial, we will just default to 1024.

**NOTE**

The initial implementation of `File::read()` saves the current
(original) position, seeks to the beginning of the stream,
`readAll`s to the end, and then resets to the original position.

  I think that this behavior is unexpected and should be changed--it
should read from the current position to the end of the stream and
stay there.  The user should explicitly `seek` to the beginning of
the stream when necessary.

  With the current implementation, the user should note that the
position *will not change* after calling `read()` with no arguments.

Addresses [Issue #761](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=761).

This is a combination of 5 commits.

1. Date in Cookie can be set via ""seconds since epoch"" as well.

* In addition to the current string format, we can now set cookies via integer of msec since epoch
* Expiration date can be set via ""expires"" or ""expiry"" option (""expires"" has priority)
* Returned cookie will contain ""expires"" as string and ""expiry"" as msec since epoch

I believe this can simplify code that uses cookies and it doesn't change the functionality.

2. Applying the ""--debug"" command line options as early as possible.

3. Fixing bug and behaviour in the CookieJar

* It's not possible to set a cookie without a domain: will default to the domain of the page it's set on
* ""page.clearCookies()"" was broken
* ""cookiejar.deleteCookie(""name"", url)"" reimplemented because deleting via ""expiration"" doesn't work

4. Improving (and more fixing) in the CookieJar

* Purging Session or Expired Cookies now works
* Added boolean return values to inform if the requested cookie operation succeeded
* Timestamps for ""expiry/expires"" in Milliseconds, as JS does by default
* Improved detection that a cookie has been accepted or rejected by the cookiejar

NOTE: Unfortunately, the Qt provided QNetworkCookieJar is a very limited
and not extremely well designed solution. It doesn't provide any ""nice
and clean"" CRUD API, and you are only left with a SET/GET to deal with.
Mechanism to understand when and when not a cookie is added are hidden,
and require extra work in the sub-class (our CookieJar) to fill the gap.

5. Methods on the ""phantom"" object to manipulate the CookieJar.

* phantom.cookies (array of JSON/Cookies)
* phantom.cookiesEnabled (boolean)
* phantom.addCookie
* phantom.deleteCookie
* phantom.clearCookies

Those methods operate on the CookieJar directly and have no URL restriction.
In other words, if page P1 can see set of cookies C1, and page P2 can see set of
cookies C2, ""phantom.cookies"" can see (i.e. operate upon) both C1 and C2."

This fixes CapserJS which builds a command line like this:
phantomjs bin/bootstrap.js --casper-path=~/capserjs --cli

That works on Phantom 1.6 but not on master due to the qcommandline
port.

Fix by extending qcommandlne to take a ParameterFence flag which causes
it to treat any options after a parameter as arguments. Switch
""scriptname"" to use that so the 1.6 behaviour is restored.

1. Complete reimplementation of the CookieJar and the Cookie API - Part 1.

The save/load mechanism is inspired by the Qt Demo ""browser"".
More info: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/demos-browser.html

2. Making the CookieJar a singleton.

We need to have multiple NetworkAccessManager to monitor the network activity of the page,
but we also need to maintain 1 CookieJar: in this way we now have a shared bucket of Cookies.

3. Exposing the new Cookies API to the JS space.

* Updated the completions.
* Ensured backward compatibility of the API.
* It's now possible to ""phantom.cookieEnabled = false"" to disable cookies completely.
* New methods: addCookie, deleteCookie, clearCookies

4. Provided some internal Doc for the new Cookies API

5. Ensuring the ""page.deleteCookie(name)"" method works only if a cookie name is given."

This addresses [Issue #151](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=151).

Summary of the new API:
- page.pages[]
- page.pagesWindowName[]
- page.getPage(windowName)
- page.windowName
- page.onPageCreated = function(newPage) { ... }

The page object created by the user holds responsibility of the ""child"" pages it creates.
If a page closes (i.e. window.close()) or a call to ""page.pages[i].release()"" is done,
the array ""page.pages[]"" will automatically update to contain only the pages still open."

For some reason, it seems that checking CONFIG(static) inside
src/phantomjs.pro is not reliable. That caused the STATIC_BUILD define
not to be set, and hence Q_INIT_RESOURCE would never get called in
main.cpp.

Instead of using Q_INIT_RESOURCE, let's just compile the resources
directly into the phantomjs binary. This means we don't need to detect
whether Qt is linked statically or dynamically.

On reflection, this approach seems like a bad idea and a source of bugs.
I think passing object references between pages seems inherently
problematic, and we are better off just passing data to the onError
handler. If users need the actual object reference, they are able to use
try ... catch within the page.

This change also means that we are no longer breaking backwards
compatibility with the page.onError function signature.

WebCore already has a bunch of plumbing to pass around stacks. This
exists for the inspector/console. However, we need to actually retrieve
the error stack in WebCore::reportException.

To achieve this, I am attaching a stackArray property to the error
object. This is not as clean as I'd like, but seems ok for now. (We
should not document stackArray though.)

This adds a new WebPage::zoomFactor property, which can be used to
zoom the page, i.e.:

page.zoomFactor = 1.5; // zoom by 50% in

The rasterize.js example is adapted to take an optional fourth argument
to set the zoom factor. Furthermore, the webpage-spec is extended with
a simple test case for the new property.

ISSUE: 460 (http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=460)

this is a backport from qtbase:

commit 89cfe9eb01ad75c14121dbd6038b7c791226acf1
Author: Jiang Jiang <jiang.jiang@nokia.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 10 18:01:56 2011 +0100

    We need to reregister fonts in initializeDb because basic font db
    doesn't have an internal record like fontconfig does, so just
    repopulating the font database won't work. db->reregisterAppFonts
    is now used properly as intended (reregister application fonts
    after the system font database has been cleared).

    Also, static variable 'initialized' in initializeDb() is removed
    since we check privateDb()->count to see if it needs to be populated
    again.

are properly resolved.

Last but not least, we now include a very slightly modified brandelf.c
from FreeBSD. This version can be compiled on Linux machines and is
used to change the ELF ABI of the binary and libs in the deployment
folder, such that they all use the old SYSV OS ABI for compatibility.

$ ssh yourhost

Note: The contents can return arbitrary HTML but since we cannot
re-layout the whole website for every page, the header/footers
must have the static height defined in the height property.

Note: The new example printheaderfooter.js shows the usage. It
also shows how one could delegate the above to a JavaScript
function on the loaded website, which allows one to print pages
and let the actually printed page decide how the header/footer
should look like.

Note: The page-counter can be reset by adding the class ""phantomjs_reset_pagination""
to HTML block-elements that should reset the counter.

[Issue 439](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=439).
This works for all kind of ""Content Body"" but with raw bytes: the issue is that QtWebKit doesn't know how to convert a ""QByteArray"" to a ""QVariant"" (to inject it in the JavaScript space), resulting in a malformed conversion (somehow it decides to create a map where byte position is the 'key' and the byte at that position is the 'value').

This fix covers most scenarios (hopefully) but we are blocked on solving it completely."

The recent patch that brought asynchronous webserver response handling
made it impossible to have proper keep-alive support in the server.

We want the server to support keep-alive though, which is especially
useful when writing a PhantomJS script that allows one to ""remote control""
PhantomJS, using the WebServer API, without flooding the TCP connections.
Also the performance might be improved.

Note: This patch reverts commit bbce8920d0a56874daba39c7d69f64e3d64c2eb8,
and resets the Mongoose code to the vanilla 3.0 version. Instead we now
support the async handling of HTTP requests using some QWaitCondition
magic.

Note: keep-alive support is optional, and disabled by default. To enable
it, use something like:

server.listen(port, {""keep-alive"": true}, function(request, response) {...});

Like before, calling response.close() is crucial. Furthermore though, a
server that has keep-alive enabled *must* set a proper ""Content-Length: ...""
header in it's response, otherwise clients will not be able to know when
the response has finished.

    Initialisation of the Completions is now done in a pure virtual.

    This means that every REPLCompletable object will ACTUALLY register
completion strings, ONLY if we are running a REPL
    and that object is ACTUALLY created.
    Otherwise, why bother?

    Adding completions for all exposed REPLCompletable objects

    Also, fixed an issue with _getCompletions()

    Few more tweaks to the REPL:

    - Now 'phantom' is the first QObject with proper completion
    - No repetition in QObject completions
    - LVAL of any user expression is now correctly prettified and
      printed

    Major things left to do:

    - Cache completions (using QCache?)
    - Add completions for the other QObject
    - When the LVAL of a user expression is a QObject, print what's
      expected, not the QObject ""real"" structure

    Introducing REPLCompletable.

    This class should be inherited by any JavaScript-exposed QObject, to
ensure correct Auto-Completion.

    Correct auto-completion for QObjects.

    - Now even QObjects can correctly provide auto-completion, and avoid
      showing ""not for users"" methods
    - The strings used for the auto-completion are stored in a single
      Index: minimum memory footprint
    - Still, there is optimization that should be done (when ""searching""
      for the right completion by prefix)
    - Completion for the objects not set up yet, but now it's just a
      trivial sequence of ""addCompletion('bla')"" in their constructors

    Changing the way we import Linenoise.

    Made the REPL into a Singleton. With Auto-completion!.

    Reasons:
    1) Needed a pointer to function (i.e. a static method) to be used
with Linenoise to provide auto-completions
    2) It makes more sense, as it's not like we are going to have 2 REPL
running at the same time, are we?

    There are problems to address:
    - the enumeration in JS seems to return only the native interface of
      our objects
    - the function completions contain argument types of those functions
    - ""private"" methods are exposed

commit dd5fab4778bb7b67f1eca26a07d430aadd458c6e
Author: Milian Wolff <milian.wolff@kdab.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 23 16:19:21 2012 +0100

    the ""mode"" string is now properly parsed, and not only the first
    char evaluated. This allows us to do fancy things like

    fs.open(file, ""rw+""); // read/write/append

    Furthermore .read() is adapted such that it will always return the
    full file contents, no matter where we have seeked to before (i.e.
    by passing + we seek to the end, hence read() would always return
    an empty string).

    To open a binary file, pass ""b"" in the mode string to fs.open, e.g.:

    fs.open(file, ""rb""); // read binary
    fs.open(file, ""wb""); // write binary
    fs.open(file, ""rwb+""); // read/write binary, append

    alternatively, one can use these shortcuts:

    fs.write(file, contents, ""b""); // write binary
    fs.read(file, ""b""); // read binary

    Unit tests are extended and the echoToFile.js example fixed (it did not
    close the file, which lead to the contents never getting written
    on-disk since flush() is never called).

    Also note that the FileSystem::open method was cleaned up and at least
    one memory leak (if QFile* could not open) was fixed. The code should
    now also be more C++-like.

commit 41139951138491459accefab22d48eba7b0b9900
Author: Milian Wolff <milian.wolff@kdab.com>

    use QString instead of QByteArray for raw binary data

    QByteArray is simply unusable in JavaScript, since functions like
    e.g. window.btoa expect a string. Also there is no sane way to
    create a byte array in javascript, as ArrayBuffer e.g. is not
    supported by QScript (at least there is no conversion in place).

    If we use QString and some custom read/write code this all works
    as expected though, we can use window.btoa to base64 encode binary
    data and we can create random binary data using String.fromCharCode

    also adds a unit test

    make it possible to read/write raw/binary files

    this adds File::readRaw and File::writeRaw functions,
    as well as 'shimmed' versions FS::readRaw and FS::writeRaw

    these functions directly use QFile and QByteArray instead of
    QTextStream and QString, making it possible to read and write
    binary data, e.g. images and such."

Trying to match http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html.

For the server response:

  * Change writeBody to write
  * Change writeHeaders to writeHead

For the request object, 'headers' is now an object containing all
key-value pairs of the actual HTTP headers.

'queryString' is folded into 'url' key.

Non-standard keys in the request: isSSL, remotePort, remoteIP,
remoteUser, are disabled in the mean-time (will be revisited after 1.4
release).

Implementation-wise, the request object is now a simple key-value pair
using QVariant, as opposed to the heavy QObject instance.

* According to Issue #32 (http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=32) I added a ""lookup logic"" that searchs for the file following those steps:
*# Search for file at given path (relative to PWD or absolute - no difference)
*# Is file there? Inject it
*# Is file not there? Try looking for it in ""scriptLookupDir""
*# Is file there? Inject it
*# Is file not there? abort
* ""scriptLookupDir"" is an extra property for WebPage, that, as by it's name, defines a place where to look to script to inject
* Script can alter the scriptLookupDir, if they want
* Updated ""injectme.js"" accordingly"

http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=17

Adding a new phantom property called ""paperSize"". It takes one of
the two possible dictionary variants:
   { width: '200px', height: '300px', border: '0px' }
   { format: 'A4', orientation: 'portrait', border: '1cm' }
- If no paperSize is defined, the size is defined by the web page
- supported dimension units are: mm, cm, in, px. No unit means px.
- border is optional and defaults to 0.
- supported formats are: A3, A4, A5, Legal, Letter, Tabloid
- orientation (portrait|landscape) is optional and defaults to portrait

I'm considering implementing a short form like:
  phantom.paperSize = 'A4';
...needs further investigation."
