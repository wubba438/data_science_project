Summary:
https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools/commit/df400939addf6dbc5f2a9e1d52a6219f356f82d8 fixes
a bug that's prevalent on tota11y master, which causes JS errors when iframes of other origins are on the page.

Until that commit makes its way to npm, I am patching the method. I'm also trying a new pattern of explicitly
called a function named patch_____() - which should be easier to remove in the future. Perhaps this could even
go in a patches.js!

We should probably think about maintaining an ADT fork as well, but this works for now.

Summary:
By placing two tests side by side, I discovered that the `require` cache was
causing a mismatch between the jQuery used by plugins and the jQuery test
authors were given access to.

I've rearranged the jsdom and plugin instancing to now occur in mocha's magic
`before` method, allow us to use these instances in all of our tests. Should
speed things up a bit, too, but I have not run any benchmarks.

Summary:
Using jsdom, we can now create an environment in which to unit test tota11y
plugins. Currently, this is limited to the Landmarks plugin, which applies labels
to elements with a role attribute.

We accomplish this by changing the behavior of `require` to do the following:
* Ignore less/handlebars loaders (i.e. `require(""./template.handlebars"");`)
* Provide our own instance of jQuery (to make the plugins work in the jsdom environment)
* Stub out the annotations module (to allow us to query for annotations in the new environment)

Tests are written in ES6 as well, using a special flag to `mocha`.

This is a first step towards providing solid unit tests for our plugins.

Test Plan: . npm test

a hot webpack-dev-server in the background. `npm run build` runs `webpack -p`.

Test Plan:
. Run `npm run build`
. See that a copy of `tota11y.min.js` appears in `build/`

. Run `npm test`
. See that the browser opens to /webpack-dev-server
. Make a CSS change (`color: red` in base.less, for example)
. See that the content updates live

Summary:
While running this toolbar on more complicated interfaces, the time to create
labels is incredible slow and, at times, crashes the page.

To reduce reflows, I've changed the behavior of the `annotate.label` method
to queue up annotations, which are then mounted to the DOM on every frame.

Renders occur in chunks for better performance. The constant `RENDER_CHUNK`
currently has a value of 20, which through testing offers 60fps performance
on my facebook homepage. We could likely double or triple this on sites with
less markup (recalc costs are lower), but on smaller sites we're less likely
to make that many annotations in the first place.

Test Plan:
. `webpack && cat dist/tota11y.js| pbcopy`
. Head over to FB.com
. Paste into the console
. Activate the ""Contrast"" plugin
. See the page doesn't hang as the labels pour in

Summary:
In order to prevent the parent document's styles from creeping into tota11y,
I've added two antipatterns to tota11y's LESS code.

The magic lies in the new `base.less`, which includes a ""reset"" of sorts. We
apply these rules to `.tota11y, .tota11y *`, meaning that everything with or
under a node with class `tota11y` will receive these styles.

There is also a PostCSS plugin included in `webpack.config.js` now which
makes every single rule in `tota11y`s CSS `!important`.

The downsides of this technique?

* To overcome the `*` rules, one needs to be extra particular when overwriting
these new base styles.
* We'll likely never be fully comprehensive with this reset, but I'll keep
updating it.
* I'll likely be banned from ever writing CSS again.

But the result is that tota11y now looks consistent on a vast majority of
sites.

There are some performance fixes coming in another diff which I found while
testing tota11y out in the wild.

Test Plan:
To test this I ran:

    webpack && cat dist/tota11y.js | pbcopy

with every change, and pasted my clipboard into devtools console on a wide
range of sites.

Summary:
We were using `axs.utils.elementIsVisible`, which checks a combination of
things including:

- If the element has zero area
- If the element is invisible
- If the element is behind other elements

We do not need the third bullet point, so I've rewritten this line to only
omit invisible elements or elements with zero area from contrast testing.

This popped up because the list of plugins is getting quite long as often
covers elements that it aims to test for.

Test Plan:
. Activate Contrast plugin
. See the first link, and the ""See more"" button are detected properly

This changeset adds a contrast plugin, which makes extensive use of Chrome's
Accessibility Developer Tools that I brought in for D18211.

It labels items with (unique) text contrast (as to not bombard the screen with
50 identical labels). If the contrast is good enough, the label is green. If
not, the label is red and contains a viable alternative on hover.

Summary:
This changeset helps users get a glimpse of accessibility errors without the
need to reference the info panel.

There is now a special `errorLabel` function in the annotate module which
creates a label with an extended description that appears on hover. I'll be
using this for alt-text as well in a future diff.

I'm hoping that this somewhat solves the ""below the fold"" problem, since users
will no longer need the info panel to tell them the errors on the page. I'll
keep iterating on the idea.

Summary:
I had a revision like this recently but abandoned it after deciding that we
should allow multiple plugins to be active.

I've changed my mind again, this time for presentation reasons. It's going to
be very noisy displaying a summary and errors for multiple plugins, and there
is no real benefit to allowing simultaneous plugins.

As such I've added a custom UI element that's a mix between a radio button and
a checkbox. This is because checkboxes allow multiple items to be selected,
and radios do not allow users to de-select. Consider this a hybrid.

Here's a GIF of it in action:

Test Plan:
. `webpack-dev-server --hot`
. `localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server`
. Click ""Headers""
. See the checkbox
. Click ""Labels""

Summary:
We used to render the info panel based on html returned from each of the
plugins. This is going to be very difficult to maintain if we want two
plugins to display information in the panel simultaneously.

I've moved the logic for rendering the panel into its own class, which plugins
can call directly. This means that info panels are now unique to the plugin
which created them.

I've also added tabs to the info panel. Currently there is an ""About"" tab, and
a ""Summary."" In a future diff I will be adding an ""Errors"" tab - a normalized
way to display errors from a plugin.

These panels will also eventually be moveable and collapseable. Not yet, so
I can keep this diff small.

Test Plan:
. `webpack-dev-server --hot`
. `localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server`
. Activate the ""Headers"" plugin
. See an info panel appear with the ""Summary"" tab active
. See you can switch between ""About"" and ""Summary""

Summary:
This changeset adds namespaces to the annotation utility. Plugins can include the annotation
module, and invoke the now-returned function with a string. That string will be used to
append an extra class to any annotations, and allow the plugins to simply call
`annotate.removeAll()` to remove them.

As such, I've removed the `className` argument to both `label` and `highlight`. Both of
these functions return the annotation as a jQuery object, so the callee can simply
call `addClass()` on the returned value (this is used in the labels plugin).

Test Plan:
. No visual changes!
. `webpack-dev-server --hot`
. `locahost:8080/webpack-dev-server/`

Summary:
Prefixers, prefixers everywhere.

This changeset does two things:
* Brings in an auto-prefixer to handle vendor prefixes
* Changes some LESS code to prefix nearly everything with `tota11y-`

I experimented with various ways to do this automatically, but we would
still need to explicitly write the `tota11y-` prefix in our templates and
jQuery selectors - so it ended up being an unnecessary abstraction. I may
revisit it.

I also added two `!important` rules to `toolbar.less`, so I am slowly
uncovering a need to do a full reset to prevent global styles from
making making the toolbar look tota11y different.

Summary:
This adds more functionality to the header plugin, enabling it to:

- Map out the inferred document hierarchy from the header tags used
- Place small labels next to the headers to mark their levels
- Highlight

I've also introduced the concept of the info panel in this changeset.
The panel is where all of the information listed above can be found.

Test Plan:
. `webpack-dev-server --hot`
. `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/`
. Expand `tota11y`, and check off the Header plugin
. See the document is mapped out and header elements are tagged
. See that hovering over the document skeleton in the info panel highlights the headers
