SdpSerializer is a library aimed to provide possible customizable
features of session description (sdp).

E.g. To set maximum audio/video/data bandwidth:

sdp = SdpSerializer.SerializeAS(sdp, {
--- audio: 100,
--- video: 300,
--- data: 10000000
});

To set ""framerate"" for audio streams:

sdp = SdpSerializer.SerializePTime(sdp, {
--- minptime: 2,
--- maxptime: 20

Streams renegotation feature added in this release.

Limitations:

1. Streams can be renegotiated between two unique users (in a single
invocation)
2. Renegotiation can only be invoked by session initiator; participants
are not allowed to invoke renegotiation

""maxParticipantsAllowed"" allows you set number of participants you like
to join your rooms...

connection.maxParticipantsAllowed = 1; // for one-to-one

Default value is ""10"" for ""maxParticipantsAllowed"".

""v1.4-modules"" directory added to allow you skip ""webrtc data channel""
specific files if you're not willing to share data. You can skip:

1. DataChannel.js
2. FileSaver.js
3. FileSender.js
4. FileReceiver.js
5. TextSender.js
6. TextReceiver.js

1. advance renegotation with better error reporting
2. language customization (of strings)
3. session re-initiation"

4. You can stop any stream:

To read what’s new in v1.3 and what you can do:

1. You can send direct messages
2. You can renegotiate streams among all users
3. You can renegotiate streams directly between two unique users
4. You can mute/unmute any stream
5. You can set bandwidth for audio/video streams

The only issue in the moment is “screen-sharing in one-way” is not
working. This issue occurs only with renegotiated streams.

When someone Mute or UnMute stream; currently unable to alert him about
the action; so he can show a “poster” in the place of “video” box. It
will be fixed in the next commits.

It was a bug which is fixed now. Two unique sessions was opened for
initiator.

1) First session was playing role of participant --- this session is
auto opened
2) Second was playing role of initiator --- this session is manually
opened by the user

Now, RTCMultiConnection-v1.2.js only opens one-session all the time.

1. You can open multi-sessions and multi-connections — in the same page
2. You can share files of any size — directly
3. You can share text messages of any length
4. You can share one-stream in many unique ways — in the same page
