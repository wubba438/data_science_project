* Bump to RuboCop latest version and run autocorrect

This is the latest version of rubocop with most of the auto-corrects
run. There are a few notes on this:
- Performance cops have been refactored out so they require being
installed in a new gem. That gem has been included so that we can keep
performance cops.
- I left out the Layout/AlignHash cop because the code base has it going both
ways. I want to put that in its own commit so that it is easy to change
or reverse if the maintainers want to go one way or another.

* Enable Layout/AlignHash and run auto-correct

This commit enables Layout/AlignHash and sets the prefered format to the
table format. The docs for this cop can be found here:
https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rubocop/RuboCop/Cop/Layout/AlignHash"

* Update Rubocop and run auto-fixes

In an attempt to do some house keeping this pushed the rubocop version
up by ten and fixes everything that is correctable from an auto-fix
standpoint. These changes should be safe if we assume that rubocop's
auto-fix changes are safe.

* Disable cop around black hole

This black hole method should not call up to super. That is the purpose
of a black hole object.

* Do not take certain changes to maintain backwards compatibility

Do not take the Unfreeze string cop because it is only supported in Ruby
2.3 and above.

* Fix class_eval to be friendlier

This came up in Style::EvalWithLocation. It makes backtraces easier to
follow.

* Selectively disabled cops for methods and classes

Rubocop now requires that cops are scoped tighter. This reformats it so
that only the specific method or class has the cop disabled.

* Enforce implicit on Style/RescueStandardError

Per ixti's code review, the maintainers prefer this enforced style so I
am changing to the requested style.

* Simplify code to ternary

This code could easily be collapsed to a ternary per ixti's request so
that is what I am doing."

HTTP servers typically wait until the whole request body has been
received before sending the response. However, some servers might send
out a response early, before they've read the whole request body. For
example, they might detect the request headers were invalid, and they
want to tell that to the client immediately.

For example, sending a large request to http://google.com will return an
early `400 Bad Request` response. In this case HTTP.rb will raise an
Errno::EPIPE exception, because it tried to write to the socket but it
couldn't because the server closed its end. However, the server still
returned a valid response, so it's not really erroneous behaviour (e.g.
curl doesn't print any errors in the same situations).

  # Before
  HTTP.get(""http://google.com"", body: ""a"" * 1*1024*1024)
  #~> Errno::EPIPE

  # After
  HTTP.get(""http://google.com"", body: ""a"" * 1*1024*1024)
  #=> #<HTTP::Response 400 Bad Request ...>

This commit ignores Errno::EPIPE exceptions when writing request data to
the socket."

IO#read and IO#readpartial accept an optional buffer string as a second
argument. This will make it so that, instead of each chunk being
allocated as a new string, each chunk is read into the buffer string
(replacing any previous value). This means that no new strings will be
allocated other than the buffer string on upload, so it's much more
memory-efficient and gives less work to the GC.

Previously we couldn't use a buffer string because of how JRuby
implements Enumerators (it fetches the next chunk eagerly, replacing the
one being returned). That's why we changed the implementation not to use
Enumerators."

IO#readpartial is preferable in cases where the IO is a stream such as a
pipe or a socket. IO#readpartial differs from IO#read in situations
where there is still some data immediately available, but not the number
of bytes requested. IO#read would in this case block until the requested
number of bytes is available, whereas IO#readpartial would immediately
return the available data, and only block if there is no data available.

Another technical difference is that, while IO#read simply returns nil
when it has reached EOF, IO#readpartial raises an EOFError, so we have
to rescue it.

With IO#readpartial uploading from pipes should now be faster, because
any data that is immediately available will be written to the TCP
socket, so the upload is less blocked by the pipe retrieving data. This
is also useful with the Down gem, which provides an IO object around a
remote file, because again uploading is less blocked by the remote file
being downloaded.

This IO#readpartial preference is even baked into Ruby itself;
`IO.copy_stream` will also prefer IO#readpartial over IO#read."

Enumeable to :body, but that's only defined for ""Transfer-Encoding:
chunked"" requests.

This will also allow us to extend form_data.rb to stream the
multipart-encoded request, instead having to load the whole body into
memory before writing it to the socket."

on following the redirect the port is lost, because we're only assigning

""Host"", and let HTTP::Request set it in the same way as it is set on the

Avoid a dependency cycle between Client and Connection classes."

I found out that sometimes you can get this error when using the gem:

    from /.../gems/http-2.0.1/lib/http.rb:8:in  `<top (required)>'
    from /.../gems/http-2.0.1/lib/http.rb:8:in  `require'
    from /.../gems/http-2.0.1/lib/http/client.rb:7:in  `<top (required)>'
    from /.../gems/http-2.0.1/lib/http/client.rb:7:in  `require'
    from /.../gems/http-2.0.1/lib/http/connection.rb:4:in  `<top (required)>'
    from /.../gems/http-2.0.1/lib/http/connection.rb:4:in  `require'

The problem was that 'http.rb' was requiring 'http/client.rb' that at
the same time was requiring 'http/connection.rb' which was requiring
'http/client.rb' again.

I think that in general is not very good to have a cycle like this in
the dependency graph of the code, so I decided to remove that dependency
by moving the constants KEEP_ALIVE and CLOSE to the Connection class.
This way Connection is now independent from Client.

Maybe this constants could go to another module but I couldn't think in
a better place."

The Addressable gem has been the source of a number of bugs and
performance problems. Perhaps in the future it might be worth
avoiding using it where ::URI would suffice, or getting rid of
it entirely, but as things stand it's the parent class for
HTTP::URI, which prevents us from doing that without making a
breaking release of the library.

This replaces inheritence with object composition: Forwardable
is used to delegate an explicit set of methods to Addressable::URI.
This should make it easier to work around Addressable bugs or
potentially even use ::URI as the internal representation when
URIs are simple enough."

I started out reverting the changes to this file back to the version
@ixti bisected as being the last good one.

I left in the *actual* code that replaced IO.select with io/wait. And
I seem to have come upon the same thing @ixti did here:

https://github.com/httprb/http/commit/9e1e100d89e365600010859ea8c87400a766c29b

I'll have to check the behavior on JRuby, and am uncertain what sequence
of events causes the rescue_readable call to be an issue, but I think this
both lets us keep io/wait and at least has the same semantics as before."

This might be a sign of deeper problems, but I have a pretty bad track record
with JRuby, CI, and specs related to timeouts."

The main motivation for this change is because JRuby 9000 supports exceptionless
non-blocking I/O for TCPSockets but not for SSLSockets. Both accept the
"":exception => false"" syntax, so it's harmless to pass it to SSLSockets even
though they silently ignore it.

It also adds handling non-blocking reads during writes and writes during reads,
which is necessary for SSLSockets to work correctly on all platforms (i.e. an
SSL handshake might require performing a read for a write to complete, or vice
versa)

I'm pleased with the result in as much as it provides a single approach which
covers all cases. The readpartial / write and wait_readable_or_timeout /
wait_writable_or_timeout methods are almost identical at this point and are
clearly ripe for some DRY-out refactoring."

Also, I must explain my very own policy about using brackets for method calls.

These are example when I will definitely put brackets:

Drop in coverage is legit. Actually it became higher, but due to bug in YARD
itself (see https://github.com/lsegal/yard/issues/726), seems like macros with
doc reference treated as ""no docs"" (as it really generates empty description):

    @!method foo
      (see Other#foo)

The above should copy all description (params and return and such) from
`Other#foo` to current scope's `#foo`, and its not at the moment. Still,
this YARD syntax is legit and should remain as is. Waiting for that bug
to be resolved. :D"

Consuming chunked stream may lead into unexpected `nil`s at any time of
consumption. Thus we should return `nil` only when `@socket` was closed.

Chunked responses are streamed in chunks. Each (full) chunk consist of:

  BYTES CRLF
  DATA CRLF

But socket does not care about consistency of those chunk, thus it's
common when we got only first part: `BYTES CRLF`. At this point we feed
this to http_parser which does not emits `on_data` event and our own
Parser `@chunk` ivar remains `nil` after previous flush.

This is no an ideal solution. Ideally we should relay explicitly on
http_parser `#finished?` flag instead. So this should be kept in mind
upon connection exctraction and refactoring.

  The request, and all future requests should be repeated using another URI.

way of the refactor.

Previously Chainable implemented a different heuristics than Client
for :response. Chainable used :object on HEAD and :parsed_body on
other verbs. Client always used :object.

This commit removes this difference and introduces :auto as option
value. It is the default one, it is implemented in Client directly
and it corresponds to the Chainable behavior above. This means that
{:response => :object} is necessary on Client to get its previous
behavior (broken private API, therefore).

By the way, we could restore the previous behavior simply by setting
:object as default in Options and forcing something else through
default_options in Chainable and/or Http. It seemed simpler to get the
auto behavior immediately in Client, though."

Tyler's changes add a Http::Response object and round trip stuff done
using the Http module through that. But Http is really designed to be
a shortcut for the common case of just wanting to grab resources off
the web.

Head requests are a good case for an exception to that behavior (as are
other requests, potentially). I'd like to examine each verb one by one
and pick the appropriate value to return from each one.

This change alters the way Http::Response objects are built to be more
like a Struct. Eventually I'd like to have the parser build these objects,
but for now Http is manually reconstructing them from Net::HTTP's response
objects."

I really do like to cowboy crap together sometimes. The first example I picked
for trying to send a JSON accept header with was an HTTPS github URL. https
is totally broken with Net::HTTP, as in if you give it an https URL, it will
try to make the request without SSL unless you explicitly tell it to use SSL.
THIS WILL NOT STAND.

The whole point of this commit was to add with_headers, but I threw all the
other stuff that was annoying me with Net::HTTP in so the tests would pass.
Mea culpa."
