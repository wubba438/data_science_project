The name of the ""different"" route controller, PostController, used in
the example for setting the controller option to Router.route({..}) is
actually the same as what would be looked up by default for a route
named ""post"". Therefore explicitly referring to PostController is
redundant.

Using the name, CustomController, that would otherwise have no relation
to a route named ""post"" demonstrates the intention more clearly and is
consistent with the name used in section, Route Specific Options:

@tmeasday,

Your initial state solution looks good. I made a few modifications so
that we don't need to pass parameters around in the ""done()"" or ""next()""
functions. These functions have a contract signature that comes from
iron:middleware-stack. See line 235 in lib/middleware_stack.js. So
overloading the parameter signature with a second parameter of ""handled""
seems like a recipe for confusion. Instead, I just use the controller's
isHandled() function.

Next up is seeing if we can set the correct HTTP status code on the
server for routes that are unknown. I think this should be a PR to
Meteor."

1. I had to pass `null` in as second argument to `this.dispatch`. I’m not sure what’s supposed to go there (wasn’t passed in before).

2. It seems the callback doesn’t get run *at all* for the root route. Is this a bug in middleware stack?

Note that this code needs to run with the devel branch of iron:location."

@tmeasday, sorry about this. But this is how all the examples in the
guide look, how it's taught on EM and also how the em command line tool
works by default. So I think quite a few people will be using the class
case and this change will cause confusion. I will add a note to the

identity. I'll do this on the next commit."

See Issue #895.

Key use case: Be able to build an Asana like interface where you want
the url to change to the item that is selected but you don't want to
rerun all helpers (thereby re-rendering the entire task list every
single time you click on something).

Couple of changes here:

1. On dispatching a new url, if the route is new then create a new
controller as we've always done before.

2. If the route is the same as the previous route AND we already have a
controller, just reconfigure the controller with the new url and
dispatch context. Don't create a new controller instance. This means we
don't need to rerun all helpers, since the controller hasn't changed.

3. Add getParams and setParams methods to controller to reactively get
and set the parameters. This way, if a helper needs to respond to
parameters reactively it can use this.getParams(). this.params will
still work the way it did before.

4. Add this.location = Iron.Location so that folks can reactively get
the current location from Iron.Location which will be reactive.

5. Instead of having iron:middleware-stack set the parameters, we'll do
it once from the router.

TODO:
- Update iron:dynamic-template to create dependencies for helper lookup.
- Update Guide and changelog getParams
- I got rid of use(...) for now to simplify things. Need to plug onRun
  into the middleware stack. Will probably do the same thing with
  onAfterAction. Show examples of how to use Connect middleware with the
  existing hooks. Will revisit how to mount handlers at paths."

Keep in mind that waitOn now automatically uses the loading hook. So if
you want manual control over what to do with the waitlist (e.g. you
don't automatically want to use the loading hook, then use the
subscriptions option instead. Hopefully the implementation should be

Issue #819

A new option called ""subscriptions"" can be used to call subscriptions
before any other action functions are run. The return value is added to
the wait list.

The ""waitOn"" option is called next. It also adds its return value to the
waitlist but has the added effect of using the ""loading"" hook
automatically. If a waitOn option is provided, the loading hook will be
automatically appended right before the action function so it will
always be the last ""before"" hook to run before the action function."

Users are finding themselves in a situation of infinite invalidation
loops. This can happen if you call this.ready() and then subsequently
add functions to the list which change the state in the same computation
tree.

Fix:
When you call wait(...) see whether we already have a dependency on the
current computation or any of its ancestors and if so throw a helpful
error message. For example:

var list = new WaitList;
Deps.autorun(function () {
 list.ready();

 Deps.autorun(function () {
   list.wait(...); // throw error
 });
});

@cmather — this exhibits my suspicion that decrementing the `notReadyCount` in the `afterFlush` is “too late”. 

One potential solution would be to do `deps.changed()` in the `afterFlush` if `notReadyCount` gets to 0 but I feel like that would just open a whole other kettle of fish."

There were two bugs which were fixed primarily by using the updated
iron-layout and iron-dynamic-template packages. I backported the
packaging release work and will do new releases of these packages.

There were actually two bugs:

1) template setter in iron-dynamic-template could create a dependency if
the parameter was undefined and the last value was also undefined. this
was fixed in the packaging branch but not backported.

2) the second bug could be reproduced by doing the following in your
action function:

this.layout(undefined);
this.layout('MyLayout');
this.render('sometemplate', {to: 'someregion'});

The rendering would happen on the wrong layout region. This has been
fixed in the newer iron-layout."

@cmather — I was going to add a test that data is cleared if you don’t do this, but realised it’s not really the router’s concern.

I think we should do the following:

  1. Make it a more lower level thing in IL that either a region is rendered or cleared in a rendering transaction. Why does the controller care about such details?

  2. Feel comfortable that IL is tested properly such that it’s impossible to “render without setting data”. That way a test here in IR is redundant as we’d be testing that it doesn’t do something that’s impossible.

Let me know if you agree and I’ll look at it."

see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/1z3nd182HIY

there were a few problems here. the first is that the action computation could
rerun before the afterFlush which means we might call beginRendering before we
finished the previous render. This solution attempts to solve this problem by
forcing the previous transaction to complete before starting a new one.

the second problem is that when have a global computation for a subscription
handle and that computation is invalidated but not rerun before the route runs,
it's possible that we wait on a handle that doesn't exist by the time it runs
again. So the value ends up being false always. I'm working on a fix to this. In
the mean time, when you set a value of the global autorun, force a Deps.flush
before calling Router.go."

@tmeasday,

Want to do a sanity check on this and make sure IR still works for you? The
expectation is that it should work as it did before (maybe with a few bugs
fixed) but uses the new iron-layout under the hood. I think if this works okay
we can do a patch release.

Next up I'll work on the larger refactor. I'll try to do this in stages so that
we can have a clear discussion around each thing and separate R&D type
improvemenets from general cleanup and API hardening."

This makes the `this.data()` and this.data({title: 'example'})` api more
consistent and predictable. When you define a controller or route you can
provide a data property like this:

data: function () {
 return Items.findOne({_id: this.params._id})

Now, you can call this.data({...}) to set the data value at a later time, or
this.data() to get the value from inside one of your controller functions."

You no longer get these hooks for free. You need to ask for them. You can pass a
string name for the hook. For example:

// run the loading hook for all routes as a before hook
Router.before('loading');

// run the notFound hook for all routes as a before hook
Router.before('notFound');

Remember that the order of hooks matters. In this example, you want the notFound
hook to come last since we want to show a loading indicator until the controller
is ready. The notFound hook checks whether the data value is falsy and if so,
renders the notFound template. But we don't want to do that until the data is
actually ready!"

- Closes Issue #469.
- We now give the user a warning if they call stop() in a RouteController
  function during a run. This is because it is unlikely the user wants to stop
  the entire controller from running. They just want to pause downstream
  functions from running (e.g. before/action/after) if some condition is not
  true in the current computation's run. But when you redirect you *really* do
  want to stop the controller.
- Solution: The Router can call a ""private"" function to stop the previous
  controller from the run method of the router.
- Test it out."

  3. computation -> run waitOn functions and populate waitlist
  4. computation -> when ready() set data
    - run onData hooks
  5. computation -> run action

    - run action function
    - onAfterAction (legacy: after) hooks

- When the router or user stops a controller by calling ""stop"":
  1. stop computation
  2. run onStop hooks
  3. isStopped state is true

- loadingTemplate and notFoundTemplate hooks are no longer added by default. If
  you want that behavior you can ask for explicitly using the string name of the
  hook (e.g. renderNotFound, renderLoading)
- If you specify a hook by string name, the Router.hooks namespace is searched.
  This gives us a place to put standard hooks and for other package authors to
  add new hooks.
- Data is set in the _run method of controller (not a hook) and waits for the
  controller to be ready (this.ready()).
- Layout is set right away on teh controler.
- Each hook is run in its own computation. This will **likely** change as it
  poses a few issues.
- Some API cleanup around uiManager

Next:

- Better hook design
- Client side blaze helpers like linkTo and pathFor
- Tests"

Child controller inherits prototype's methods from the parent controller prototype.

So, if we have `Parent` controller

```js
Parent.prototype.before = function () {
  console.log('parent.before');
};
```

and we create `Child` class inheriting from the `Parent` we will have prototype as follows:

```js
Child.prototype.before = function () {
  console.log('parent.before');
};
```

Now when collecting hooks, the result hooks array will contain both functions instead one and it will cause double hook execution.

The problem is this line: https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router/blob/dev/lib/route_controller.js#L45

```js
return ctor.prototype[hookName] ? hooks.concat(ctor.prototype[hookName]) : hooks;
```

What it does is checking if given hook is in the given prototype but it will be true even if the hook is not in the prototype. It's because it will look in the prototype of the parent class and so on. So, if we have three classes inheriting from each other:

`C` <- `B` <- `A` <- `RouteController`

and only `A` class will have `after` or `before` hook, it will still think that each one has given hook.

To deal with that, we have to explicitly check if a given prototype has a hook by using `Utils.hasOwnProperty` function.

```js
return Utils.hasOwnProperty(ctor.prototype, hookName) ? hooks.concat(ctor.prototype[hookName]) : hooks;
```"

- WaitList data structure: keeps track of a list of objects that have a ready
  handle. Creates a computation for each handle and tracks how many things we're
  waiting on. The wait list is ready if the wait count is 0. Depedency is only
  changed if the ready state for the entire thing has changed.

- The value of the waitOn list is appended to the waitList at run time (as in,
  when the controller is run, not when it is constructed)

- The wait list is cleared on each new run, including when the run's computation
  is re-run.

- You can add things to the current wait list by calling `this.wait(..)` or by
  calling the `wait()` method on a subscription inside a before hook or action
  function.

- Nothing is preventing someone from calling `wait` outside of the run method.
  But it just won't do anything since the waitlist is cleared on each run.

- Changed render logic. If you call `render()` it renders the main template and
  all of the yield regions. You can still call `render('templateName')` to
  render into the main region or `render('templateName', {to: 'yieldreg'})` to
  render into a named yield.

- Hopefully this means people can put most of their logic in the action function
  since calling `render` is all you need to do to render all the default stuff.

- TODO: tests, try it out."

Issue #208

How it Works:
- You can call the `subscribe` method on a RouteController instance, which means
  you can call this.subscribe from a before hook.

- The return value of this.subscribe adds a wait() method that simply adds the
  subscription handle to a list of handles the user intends to wait on.

- Before hooks can now call this.wait(onReady, onWait). Notice we didn't pass a
  list as the first parameter. The default list is the RouteController's wait
  list. Multiple before hooks can call this method.

- You can still call this.wait with a list if you want to pass custom handles (a
  handle is just an object that has a ready() function).

- waitOn still works but all waitOn functions are called at RouteController
  constructor time and added to the waitList to be used when the controller is
  run. This helps ensure the subscriptions aren't called multiple times."

@payner35, @gabrielhpugliese.

- Doesn't work yet but I wanted to push and get feedback
- The idea is that the Router has a _renderer instance
- This _renderer is responsible for tracking a layout, a data context and one or
  more templates to be rendered into named yields. Each can vary independently.

Benefits:
 - @piffie's idea to allow recursive yields into child templates
 - controller level layouts
 - data context can be preserved across routes
 - templates and layouts can change independently

Example using the raw RouterRenderer:

```javascript
var renderer = new RouterRenderer;
document.body.appendChild(renderer.render());
renderer.setLayout('layout');
renderer.setTemplate('mainTemplate'); // render to __main__ region
renderer.setTemplate('asideTemplate', 'aside'); // {{yield 'aside'}}
renderer.setTemplate('footerTemplate', 'footer'); // {{yield 'footer'}}
renderer.setData({title: 'Some data context'});

The following use cases must be handled when working with route computations in
the onRun method:

1) Old computation invalidated then new route is run before flush. For example,
the user writes this code:

Posts.update({...}); // invalidate the old computation
Router.go('/someOtherPath'); // go to new route

2) Subscribe to the same subscription between routes should not create a new
subscription.

3) Subscribe to a new subscription in a new route should stop the subscription
from the previous route.

4) New computations must not be stopped because we call stop on the previous
computation. In other words, the new computation must be

Solution Details:

We need to stop the previous computation and set up a new computation for the
new route. But the new computation must be set up before the next flush,
otherwise we'll lose out on Meteor's subscription optimization (don't create a
new subscription in a computation if that subscription has already been created
- e.g. from a previous route). But we also need to stop a subscription if a new
route doesn't re-run it.

Previously, I was setting up the new computation in a Deps.afterFlush callback.
This effectively created a new computation that wasn't stopped. However, it has
two problems. The first is that it bypasses Meteor's subscription logic, and
creates a new subscription no matter what, even if the previous subscription was
the same. The second problem is that there's no reason to wait for the next
flush before setting up the new route. This may have even been causing
performance problems.

What we should be doing is stopping the previous computation and putting the
function to set up the new computation in an onInvalidate callback. Here's how
it works:

A computation's onInvalidate callbacks get called in the current event loop tick
for one of two reasons:

1) the computation has been stopped
2) the computation has been invalidated

So when we call stop on the previous computation and then call
onInvalidate(maybeRunReactively), the maybeRunReactively function is run right
away, because the previous computation is stopped (which implies invalidated).

1. Data isolation issue:

Inside the render method of controller is where we call the data function if
it's a function. Previously, the function call was not isolated, so if the deps
invalidated the entire route would be rerun instead of just the data function.
That kind of defeats the point of having a data function. So I added an autorun
around the call to wait (which encloses the onReady and onWait methods. This has
the added benefit of making wait work even if reactive: false option is set on
the route.

2. Route computation bug

The bug could be triggered by the following example click event handler:

'click': function (e, tmpl) {
 Posts.update(...);
 Router.go('anotherRoute');
}

Problem:
The problem is that the update invalidates the current route's computation, but
before that computation is flushed, the new route is run. The onRun method in
ClientRouter checks for a previous computation and finds one. Then it said if
the previous computation is marked as invalid, run the new route in an
invalidation callback. But since the computation is currently marked as invalid
(but not stopped) the onInvalidate function is run immediately (before the stop
method is even called). This causes the new route to run right away. But then we
call stop on the previous computation, which has now been reset to the new
route. And then the previous route handler re-runs, rendering the template old
template to the page.

Fix:
If we find a previous computation stop it immediately. Then in an afterFlush
callback run the new route. This will cause the new computation not to be a
child of the old one and therefore not be stopped."

The flushing mechanism works as follows:

RouteController.create() delays inheritance until after all initial code has
loaded and executed by putting the inheritance code in a callback to
RouteController.onCreateFlush(...).

The Router in turn, doesn't start until the createFlushQueue is drained, which
happens automatically at the right time if anything is added to it using the
onCreateFlush. The router does this by putting its start code in a callback to
RouteController.afterCreateFlush(...).

This works similarly to the Deps.afterFlush and Deps.onFlush methods. One
limitation of this approach is that there is a slight delay before the router
renders. It might be more performant to control load order by putting code in
packages. But this seems a lot to ask of app authors. But it might be years
before Meteor releases a load ordering mechanism."

- Instead, we want to store the current computation for a route, only if there
  is one, and then on the next run, see if there's a current computation and
  stop it if so.
- Also moved this into the onRun method, because server side doesn't need
