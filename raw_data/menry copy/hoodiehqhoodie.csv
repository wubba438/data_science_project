BREAKING CHANGE:

For `hoodie.store`:

- Before, change events (incl. add, update, remove) have only been triggered when using the custom APIs like `.add()` or `.update()`. Now they get always triggered, including for changes replicated into the database. https://github.com/hoodiehq/pouchdb-hoodie-api/commit/1958c425b7a9dc859434bdf2c057ac538db03f95

- the order of when the methods’ promises resolve and the events get triggered cannot be guaranteed as we rely on PouchDB’s .changes(). We would love to enforce promises to resolve after changes get emitted, but the required complexity to do that is not worth it.

- separate methods like `require(pouchdb-hoodie-api/add)` can no longer be required directly

  The reason for that is that all the methods now also accept a `prefix` argument which by default is null. That way we don’t need to implement each method twice, once for `store.add`, and once for `store.withIdPrefix(test/).add`

- We no longer map PouchDB’s `._id` property to `.id`, instead we pass trough docs from PouchDB 1:1. Also the timestamps are now all namespaced with `.hoodie` (`doc.createdAt` becomes `doc.hoodie.createdAt`)

For `hoodie.account`:

* `account.ready` has been removed. All APIs are now asynchronous, no setup is needed any longer
* `account.fetch()` and `account.profile.fetch()` have been removed. Use `account.get()` and `acc* `account.fetch()` and `account.profile.fetch()` have been removed. Use `account.get()` and `acc* `account.fetch()` and `account.profile.fetch()` have been removed.

Use `account.following conditions is true

  1. User is signed out
  2. Only `id` and or `session` properties are requested
  3. `options.local` is set to true
* `account.hasInvalidSession()` has been removed. Use `account.get(session)` instead (check of `session.invalid`)
* `account.isSignedIn()` has been removed. Use `account.get(session)` instead."

BREAKING CHANGE:

The store instance which `server.plugins.store.api.open(dbName)` resolves to
has several breaking changes via [pouchdb-hoodie-api@2.0.0](https://github.com/hoodiehq/pouchdb-hoodie-api/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

  from PouchDB 1:1. Also the timestamps are now all namespaced with

Unless you use the `server.plugins.store.api.open(name)` API you are not affected by any of this."

Your app is only affected if you use `hoodie` as a hapi plugin within your existing hapi app. Instead of passing `options.db` that would get passed to a PouchDB constructor internally, you know pass in `options.PouchDB` directly, with all defaults and adapters already set as your app requires it.

BREAKING CHANGE:

* Before this change, we loaded admin accounts from CouchDB’s `/_config/admins` API or for PouchDB we simply set the password to `""secret""` and wrote it into `.hoodie/config.json`

  We dropped persisting the admin password altogether and instead made it an option: `adminPassword`. If it’s not set, then no admin account exists.

  ([5899eda1](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server/commit/5899eda1))

* Before storing the secret in the database using PouchDB, it was stored in different ways based on the adapter.

  1. If the used PouchDB adapter was http (CouchDB), the secret was loaded from `/_config/couch_httpd_auth/secret`
  2. If the used PouchDB adapter was any other PouchDB adapter, the secret was stored in a file at `<data path>/config.json`

  To migrate to this version, create a database `hoodie-config` with a document `{""_id"": ""hoodie"", ""secret"": ""<your secret here>""}`

  ([cd055af1](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server/commit/cd055af1))

* CouchDB’s `_users` database is configurable at `/_config/couch_httpd_auth/authentication_db`. We read out this configuration and used it as the name of the users database. But as we don’t rely on the special behavior of CouchDB’s users database (auto-hashing of passwords) we can use any normal CouchDB database to store the accoutns of Hoodie. And as the `/_config` API is not implemented by CouchDB-like hosters like Cloudant, we want to store this configuration ourselves.

  For now, we hardcode the database name to default to `_users`. The name can be configured via `options.account.usersDb`.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Hoodie dropped its dependency on localStorage in order to work in non-browser environments. In order to make that work we have to use async store APIs to load the current state like the session id, username or the connection status.

The APIs `hoodie.account`, `hoodie.store` and `hoodie.connectionStatus` can now only be used after the promise returned by `hoodie.ready` resolves."

BREAKING CHANGE:

Hoodie now keeps state of all databases and access in a dedicated
`hoodie-store` database. If your app uses CouchDB as its backend, there
is no migration required, it happens automatically on next restart.

If you don’t use CouchDB (which is the default), the simplest way to
""migrate"" is to delete the `.hoodie/data` folder. It will loose all
data, so this is only an option for local development. If you don’t want
to loose data, you manually have to create the `hoodie-store`
database with documents for each user database. The documents look
like this:

```json
{
   ""_id"": ""db_user/lsdlo55"",
   ""_rev"": ""1-a01e6998fb10543ca0402e648dd1d048"",
   ""access"": {

Before this change hoodie generated and persisted a unique id

It's now simply using 8080 as the default port and using whatever
is provided with the port option. With the `.hoodierc` users may
persist their choice and have the same effect, but without the
overhead in `hoodie-server`. This change made the entire
`config-store.js` obsolete."

BREAKING CHANGE:

Does no longer watch the plugin file paths, because other parts of plugins aren't watched as well.
Applying these changes live without reloading the accompanying backend parts could result in inconsistent plugin behavior.

Now a clean restart of hoodie is required.

BREAKING CHANGE:

It's no longer possible to set a custom `hoodie.hoodiejs` property in the package.json, because it's no longer locked inside hoodie-server like it was before.
You can now use standard npm techniques to overwrite that dependency."

This touches and changes a lot of things, so that the hapi server creation is now at the heart and center of this module (where it belongs).
Because the tests aren't really tests – they just check if certain internal functions exist – this has to touch and delete tests as well.
While that totally looks like it's breaking everything the surfacing API remains exactly the same.

The function signature of `require('hoodie-server')` changed, so that it doesn't auto start the hoodie-server, but it just passes it to the callback.
This way the CLI actually takes care of starting it, and some logging could already be separated out of the logic.
This will eventually make testing easier.

This is an API that was never documented or public and therefor this is not a breaking change.

This was only used to perform custom path operations that aren't reliably, and
easily doable. Using `require.resolve` is applicable for all these use cases.
I'm removing the flag, because it isn't used throughout the code-base now.
It won't invite further misuse this way.

The route was introduced w/932d337016b47b9e93f8a5dbf069988d87a1c9ba so the
html file could be loaded. When later the need for this file was no longer
there, the file was removed w/a22bfce7adc4c18e676d997349bb051e74d35c64,
but the route wasn't. This is fixed by this commit.

Should we ever need to serve a static file out if this repository again,
there is no need for custom path handling.

Instead of differentiating between `is_in_app` and `!is_in_app` like this:
```js
function (request, reply) {
  var projectDir = options.app.project_dir;
  var internalFilePath = 'node_modules/hoodie-server/lib/assets/force-gzip.html';
  if (!options.app.is_in_app) {
    // we are running inside hoodie-server, e.g. in dev and test mode
    internalFilePath = internalFilePath.replace('node_modules/hoodie-server', '');
  }
  var finalFilePath = path.join(projectDir, internalFilePath);
  reply.file(finalFilePath);
}
```

a relative `require.resolve` is really all it takes:

```js
function (request, reply) {
  reply.file(require.resolve('../../../assets/force-gzip.html'));
}
```

janl,2015-06-19 20:01:23,https://api.github.com/repos/hoodiehq/hoodie/git/commits/932d337016b47b9e93f8a5dbf069988d87a1c9ba,932d337016b47b9e93f8a5dbf069988d87a1c9ba,"feat(http): Allow clients to request a gzip response with ?gzip=force or cookie

Some clients, while understanding gzip resources and sending the
correct Accept-Encoding HTTP header are behind proxy servers that
strip the header, resulting the server to send a non-gzip response.

Steve Souders, Tony Gentilcore and Andy Martone outline a way to
resolve this in:

http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/07/12/velocity-forcing-gzip-compression/

This implements the server-side component of this scheme. Any request
to /_api that has a query parameter `?gzip=force` or a cookie value
`hoodie_force_gzip=true` will receive a gzipped response, even if no
Accept-Encoding header is present or if it is mangled.

Thanks to Philip @latentflip Roberts for brainstorming an approach and
for providing a proof of concept that I could work off of.

We now only start one hoodie-server for all integration tests
(except for the `require` one). This speeds up the integration
test runtime. It also helps to not use too many sockets that are
used in HTTP requests between hoodie-server and CouchDB during
startup and setup.

In addition, test cases now use the `pool: false` parameter with
`http.request`, to avoid even more keepAlive issues.

This feels like treating a sympton and not the cause, but given
that this has a bunch of benefits, I’m inclined to include this.

The actual issue will likely be fixed in a future hoodie-server
refactor."

Switch from cookies to bearer tokens
This PR takes auth token from the couchdb cookie and exposes it as a bearer
token at the HAPI level:
* When couchdb sets a cookie, it is stripped, and the authToken is added to
    the JSON body.
* When a request comes in, the 'Bearer ...' token is read from the Authorization
    header, and converted to a cookie for couchdb.

This happens at the hapi level.
The solution is based on https://github.com/spumko/hapi/issues/1637
and https://github.com/spumko/hapi/blob/master/docs/Reference.md

BREAKING CHANGE:

Hoodie is not using cookies for authentication anymore and relies
on hoodie.js@^1.0.0"

Previously, when sending a request to a `server.api.plugin-request`
hook (think webhook), instead of calling the handler function for
the plugin specified in the URL, we called *all* handler functions

This fixes that and only calls the hook that was requested.

The reason for the change is that we have contexts where a plugin
needs access to a full `hoodie` instance, like a web hook that
wants to record the HTTP body into CouchDB. I call these dynamic
hooks, but I am happy to bikeshed this.

Another type of hook are ones that do not depend on a full `hoodie`
instance, for example ones, that we use to augment the hoodieServer
before starting it up. I call them static hooks, again, happy to
bikeshed.

Another difference between the hooks is that they are initialised
at different places in the lifecycle of hoodie-server:

- static hooks are initialised when plugins are read but before
  the Hapi server gets started.
- dunamic hooks are initialised, after everything is started,
  so they can expect a fully running Hoodie to do their work.

In order to make this easy to understand for plugin authors, I
changed the place for defining hooks from the top level
`hooks.js` to a top level directory `hooks/` with two files,
`static.js` and `dynamic.js`. Either file and the hooks
directory are optional.

This isn’t as pretty as I had hoped it could be, but I don’t see
a way around this, and it is still not too hard to understand.

See hoodiehq/hoodie-plugin-debug-email for an exmaple plugin.

The previous code would exit the looping over plugins early
if the current hook wasn’t found in the current plugin.

This also fixes the reporting of whether a hook as been run
to the calling code.

janl,2014-02-25 23:19:57,https://api.github.com/repos/hoodiehq/hoodie/git/commits/d77e0cec3f4e0a0b98346bd3da7f23b5efb71936,d77e0cec3f4e0a0b98346bd3da7f23b5efb71936,"Introduce Server Hooks that plugins can register to be called for

If a plugin has a file `hooks.js` in it’s top level directory and
the file exports a dictionary of hook names and functions,
hoodie-server will call the function for the specified hook.

An example `hooks.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
 'server.pack.pre': function (pack) {
    console.log('hook: server.pack.pre called');
  },

  'server.pack.post': function (pack) {
    console.log('hook: server.pack.post called');
  },

  'server.api.plugin-request': function (request, reply) {
    reply({testplugin: 'works'});
  }
};
```

This patch adds three hooks:

 - `server.pack.pre`
 - `server.pack.post`
 - `server.api.plugin-requet`

The first two run before and after the `pack` setup but just
before `pack.start()`.

The last one gets called for every request to
`/_api/_plugins/<plugin-name>/_api/`

More hooks can be added easily with:

> hooks.run('name.of.hook', [hook, arguments]);

Note that the hook names and the format of hooks.js are just a
suggestion, and open for bikesheds. An alternative could be
a directory `./hooks/` inside a plugin with files:

- `server.pack.pre.js`,
- `server.pack.post.js`,
- `server.api.plugin-request.js`

and so on. Each would include a single exported function.

If you project needs a hoodie.js that is different from the default, you
can now specify an alternate dependency source for `hoodie`.

e.g.:

```

  ""dependencies"": {
    ""hoodie-server"": ""~0.8.12"",

    ""hoodie"": ""git://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie.js.git""
  },
  ""subdomain"": ""hoodie-foo"",
  ""domains"": [
    ""admin.hoodie-foo.jit.su"",
    ""couch.hoodie-foo.jit.su""
