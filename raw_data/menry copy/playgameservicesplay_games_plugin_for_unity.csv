Motivation: Some projects like mine uses different app ids and bundle ids for different environment distributions (ci, staging, production). In previous version of the plugin the class was not using a singleton and would reload when necessary.

Proposed change: Add a static reload function. The function will simply replace the current static instance by a new one.

Possible improvements: Move the logic inside the constructor to a public Load function and avoid the static instance replacement, but allowing the data stored in the dictionary to be refreshed / replaced."

This is a incremental update to ewokian.  Improvements and bug fixes for Multiplayer,
adding callbacks to many API calls. Saved Games fixes.

Also added using CocoaPods for building iOS.

  **BREAKING CHANGES**
       * #382 Callback for declined invitation when creating RTMP room
    This change adds the method `OnParticipantLeft` to the
 `RealTimeMultiplayerListener` interface.  Existing games that use this interface
need to add an implementation of this method.
  New Features:
       * #136 Callback for ShowLeaderboardUI()
       * #392 Support for Default waiting room for RTMP
       * #498 Bitmask filter in CreateQuickGame
       * #537 Exposing Saved Games Delete API
       * iOS builds will use Cocoapods if installed to build xcode project.

Per MSDN
(https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/a95009h1(v=vs.100).asp
x), an attempt to pin a GCHandle for a non-blittable type should throw
an argument exception. The type System.Delegate is non-blittable.

The version of Mono used by Unity does not throw an exception, but the
IL2CPP scripting backend does throw this exception. Therefore, this
code does not work with IL2CPP.

However, it should not be necessary to pin this GCHandle. A normal mode
handle should ensures that the managed object will not be collected."
