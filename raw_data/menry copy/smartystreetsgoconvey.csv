Correctly identify package names in modules on Go 1.9+"

The go/types package introduced a change in Go 1.9 (not documented in
the relese notes) that is required for golang.org/x/tools/go/packages
to compile. The previous commit's dependency on that library would
break support for Go versions < 1.9. Since those versions can't be
using modules, the old implementation using go/build will continue to
work for them. We separate the impacted functions out into two versions
that use build tags with conditional compilation to use the out of
GOPATH module supporting version in Go >= 1.9 and the old behavior in
Go < 1.9."
zeffron,2019-03-29 14:57:14,https://api.github.com/repos/smartystreets/goconvey/git/commits/7bc4e4f953b08d798bfdbe5cddad18ff76901d5e,7bc4e4f953b08d798bfdbe5cddad18ff76901d5e,"Correctly identify package names in modules

Currently, GoConvey uses go/build and `build.ImportDir()` to collect
information about a package, including its name. Under modules that
live outside of the GOPATH, this resolution breaks, and every module
ends up with the name ""."". At the very least this breaks coverage by
causing all coverage reports to be written to client/reports.html
instead of client/reports/<opackage specific>.html.

The core issue is the go/build does not fully support modules. There
was a partial fix submitted in https://github.com/golang/go/commit/f85125345cc5d3eb054c90bfca4bda3544d7fcab,
but it only works if the package being looked up is being looked up by
name, not by path, and GoConvey somewhat necessarily uses the path. As
outlined in the above commit, the intended solution is to use the
golang.org/x/tools/go/packages which will hopefully be migrated to
go/packages in a future Go version."

Small change to include files that end in _tests.go as external callers"
mtiller,2015-05-01 11:46:51,https://api.github.com/repos/smartystreets/goconvey/git/commits/630e8c057fe8cf2fe3068a93248b9fca1692a330,630e8c057fe8cf2fe3068a93248b9fca1692a330,"Small change to include files that end in _tests.go as external callers

This change came about because of a use case where the current semantics around resolving
external callers was not ideal.  The use case was for testing interfaces.  In such cases,
the interfaces are typically stored in one package while implementations are stored
in another.  Furthermore, tests written against the interface are stored with the interfaces
but the actual tests that instantiate the implementation and call the interface tests
are stored with the implementations.  The net result of this is that GoConvey would
get confused on who the external caller was AND any files that ended in _test.go stored
with the interfaces were excluded during compilation of the implementations.  This small
change allows files ending in _tests.go to also be candidates for external callers.  The
result is that tests written against interfaces can be stored with the interfaces in
a file that ends with _tests.go and the Go compiler will, therefore, include them when
compiling the implementations...and all is well."
