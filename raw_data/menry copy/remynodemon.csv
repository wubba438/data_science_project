Originally a new Set was generated upon every individual file (or dir)
watched. This typically doesn't take a long time, but if there's 10,000
files to watch, it's very, very slow. Moving this logic out to the ready
event instead, cuts all the processing time of the watch right down."

I've gone back and forth on this Chokidar option `cwd` and in this fix
I've removed it from the config. I've checked the issues that were
raised that caused me to add the option, and they still appear to pass
in the tests, so I believe it's okay.

Originally used ps-tree which relied on `ps` on *nix. But if the system
didn't have `ps` at all, we'd try to kill the child process, but alas
this would not always work, as we're spawning `sh` and _then_ node, so
the kill would only kill the `sh` process, and not the running node
process.

The new @remy/pstree lib sniffs for `ps` and defers to ps-tree,
otherwise it will walk /proc and map the PPID to the child process
allowing nodemon to fully clean up."

If I have a nodemon.json config file with an `exec` property, then this is automatically appended with ` index.js` when running `nodemon` standalone.

I would expect this to be equivalent to running `nodemon --exec ""my cmd""` - that is providing an `exec` prevents defaulting of `script` to index.js.

To resolve, move the code which defaults the `script` property when `exec` is undefined to after the config files have been read, so that the behaviour is the same irrespective of whether properties are set in CLI flags or in nodemon.json."

The library blessed inside of the webpack-dashboard does some funky stuff with std streams and the expectation of the encoding. I'm not 100% sure of this change, I've got to see all the tests, but this tweak moves to inherit the child's stdin and doesn't purposely encode the stdin stream as utf8 (which, I don't recall exactly why I did this in the first place…though I'm fairly sure it was another issue somewhere else in nodemon).
* fix: use stdin:inherit when we're not forked
* fix: don't use inherit when required
* style: lint
* style: I am going to 🐎 kick the lint in the 🌰"

This was copied and pasted more than a handful of times around the
library and tests. Some implementations were more naive and did not
try to add quotes if there are spaces within a single argument.

There is one slight oddity in one of the cli parse tests. Stringifying
the command causes many of the arguments to show up in quotes when they
probably shouldn't. This seems to trace back to a deep problem related
to how commands are pulled out of package.scripts.start and is out of
scope for this patch. Even though the test might look incorrect now, it
is an accurate reflection of what the generated command is."

Previously, the --nodejs flag was being prepended if you had any
arguments prefixed with '--', even if they were intended for your
application. There is an additional problem where arguments intended for
node js need to be grouped into a single argument passed after --nodejs.

After this patch, any flag before your script is considered a nodejs
argument. These, along with any other exec arguments are bundled into a
single argument separated by spaces.

Fixes #530"

If you try to run nodemon with a coffee file script and pass an
argument to your application, it is instead adding a --nodejs when there
are no node flags to pass along. This causes the command to fail because
the script name is now passed as a flag to node.

Repro:

  nodemon script.coffee --my-argument

Expected:

  coffee script.coffee --my-argument

Actual:

  coffee --nodejs script.coffee --my-argument

This method creates a file and checks the stat to check of an offset between the date on the machine and the created time on the file system. Docker (in my tests) show that you can get the offset using this method.

Once we have the offset, we tell the user (once) and then we use that to find files that have been modified according to the offset (either looking in the last using -mmin or in the future using -newer + a touched file)."

This commit removes the duplication that happened at the options and options.execOptions level. Now all exec related information lives in options.execOptions.

I've updated all the references and tests that referred to things like options.script, etc.

This also fixes the (new) bug with exec argments not being placed in the right position when the script is detected via a package (so it reads `node --debug app.js` - this is resolved in command.js (due to the flattening of the config).

I've also fixed a few tests that said they were passing, but actually should have failed (but didn't because I was mocking too much of the code)."

Fixed bug in windows wherein lines in nodemonignore with comments are not processed correctly.

if my nodemonignore looks like
/.git/
/public/ #public files 
Then nodemon processes it correctly

However if my ignore file is 
/public/ #public files 
/.git/
The /public folder does not get ignore. 

Found out that this is because when the files are split by '\n', on some systems .nodemonignore is saved with \r\n as the  newline (sublime text does this). The remaining \r in the string causes the regex replaces in addIgnoreRule to fail.

I added another regex replace on \r and \n to fix this."
