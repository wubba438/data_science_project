delete images older than X days.

In this patch we are introducing a new option and a new behavior. User
will now be able to keep the latest N images through `keep_latest`
option. And the images won't be deleted even if older than X days if
they were pulled in the latest X days.

deployment, this doesn't make much sense. Moreover, even if you are

it's totally out-dated. Last but not least, I don't think such files

This commit is the resulting effort of porting Portus from Rails 4.2 to
Rails 5.2. Moreover, while at it, I've also upgraded plenty of other ruby
gems.

Many things had to be adapted, but most of the work has been done in
tests. First of all, we made a heavy usage of controller tests, and
these kinds of tests have (de facto) been nuked. Request tests are the
recommended way to perform these kinds of tests, but they forbid mock
access into important things like the session. Many tests had to be
adapted into request tests, and some of them became system tests (e.g.
Omniauth support). System tests have replaced feature tests, which
allows us to remove a lot of boilerplate to setup capybara and such.

A vulnerability has been found against the version we were using, so
I've upgraded this gem to a version fixing this. That being said, we are
only using on tests, since it's only used by selenium-webdriver. Hence,
it does not affect us, really.

Instead of adding all the gems as sources, we will use the cpio
strategy, which does not need to change the spec file or, more
important, does not need us to add/remove the .gem files into the
package every time there is a change in the Gemfile.lock file.

However, using this strategy the gems are copied on another path, and we
need to fix this.

Then, we will need to adapt the _service file in obs to have these
sections, to download the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock, and to create the
cpio with the gems:

  <service name=""download_url"">
    <param name=""protocol"">https</param>
    <param name=""host"">raw.githubusercontent.com</param>
    <param name=""path"">/SUSE/Portus/master/Gemfile</param>
  </service>
  <service name=""download_url"">
    <param name=""protocol"">https</param>
    <param name=""host"">raw.githubusercontent.com</param>
    <param name=""path"">/SUSE/Portus/master/Gemfile.lock</param>
  </service>
  <service name=""bundle_gems"">
    <param name=""strategy"">cpio</param>
  </service>

A part from that, we need to add bundler-*.gem as a SOURCE in the spec
file, since the obs-service-bundle_gems does not add this gem into the
cpio.

Let's include the gems as sources instead of build requirements so
building this package does not require so many gem packages.

Build requiring rubygem packages is a ""nightmare"" when you try to build
portus in different repos:

* sometimes the rubygem RPMs are not there and need to be submited
* othertimes they are present but have a different version and that
 creates a conflict

Since the new macros in ruby-common are generating the

""Provides: bundled(rubygem(foo)) = version""

we don't need the BR to explicetely tell which rubygems are in, plus the
""provides"" is much more explicit.

This commit fixes one of the oldest requests we've had: being able to
delete a namespace. It also introduces an API endpoint for it. There are
two exceptions when it comes to deleting a namespace:

1. Personal namespaces cannot be removed. In the future we might
   implement user removal, and then it will make sense to re-iterate on
   this.
2. Global namespaces cannot be removed, because they are meant to be
   guaranteed by everyone using the registry.

Travis apparently does not consider the whole git log, so when trying to
start git-validation from an old entry, it will fail. The solution is to
simply use the target branch if available, so in PRs we check
git-validation only for new commits.

I've also removed the quiet flag because after this change the output
shouldn't be that long.

With the migration to webpack 4, the latest uglify plugin stopped
removing comments by default and some unnecessary files were being
included.

- Moment.js was replaced with dayjs
- Webpack bundle analyzed was added to be used when necessary to analyze
bundle content

Unfortunately bundle is still big but that's because vue-multiselect was
introduced and lots of templates were migrated to .vue files.

So far the feature tests with js enabled were running through
poltergeist driver. As we know, PhantomJS was discontinued and
that's bad. PhantomJS was far from perfect and we've had a lot
of flaky issues with it.

Even knowing that most of those flaky issues were our fault, it's
always good to improve our workflow whenever possible. Based on this we
are adding chrome headless as our default js runner for our feature
tests.

Unfortunately we had to keep poltergeist for one scenario that we
couldn't make chrome headless work properly. That scenario is when the

This commit introduces a new concept: bots. Bots are regular users that
are created by administrators, but with some subtelties:

1. A bot doesn't own a personal namespace.
2. A bot cannot login via web.
3. A bot can only log in with application tokens (a token is generated
    automatically when creating a bot).

This should cover the needs from #517 and #801, except for a couple of
small features that should be added in the near future:

- Bots should be able to be created by mere team owners. These team bots
  should be attached to a specific team, but an administrator might be
  able to upgrade it to a global bot.
- Team owners should be able to be more granular on repository access
  (instead of granting access to all repositories from a given
   namespace).

See #517
See #801

This commit fixes a couple of bugs present in both master and 2.3:

1. We didn't implement some options that needed to be passed to the LDAP
   backend to fully support SSL connections. This has been addressed
   also in the configuration, but without breaking existing
   installations (e.g. the `method` attribute from 2.3 has been left
   untouched). This will be addressed in later commits of the master
   branch (so in 2.4 users should adapt to this change).
2. We were relying on Devise's translations for failures, but some of
   them were not available. This has been addressed and improved: the
   error message will be more on point and more informative to end
   users.

There is still room for improvement, but we can do it in later commits:
let's keep this commit to the point so it can be cherry-picked into the
2.3 branch.

We got rid of the admin dashboard page. We finaly complete the unification
of admin tasks/vision on the regular pages. If the user is an admin,
they will see more things on the page now.

In this case, the dashboard page will show similar components to what the
user used to see on the admin dashboard page. The main difference is that
now we have tabs grouping the types of recent activities.

We got rid of the admin namespaces page and unified the vision of the
admin on the regular namespace page. So, if the user is an admin, they
will be seeing all of the namespaces and will be able to manage all of
them. If the user is a regular one, everything stays the same.

One improvement we did was to separate the other namespaces the user had
access to without being through membership in a different panel. This
will help the user understand better how they have access to those
namespaces.

This commit is more explicit on what to do when a catalog error happens.
In this case, if a plain catalog error happens (fetching the list of
repositories and their manifests), then nothing will be done. If
fetching the catalog worked, and fetching the list of tags then suddenly
fails, before this commit that repo would've get nuked because it
would've get a repository with no tags.

This commit instructs to skip that repository when considering whether
to remove or not some repositories that are found to be dangling.

If you are a Portus admin, you might want to create various teams with
its respective owners. So far the path to achieve that was tedious and
not friendly. Admin had to create a team, add a member as owner and
remove himself as ownere later on.

With this patch, we are unifying the admin team page with the normal
team page and adding the ability to assign a different owner for a
team.

API also had an impact with this change. The GET /api/v1/teams endpoint
will expose all the accessible teams if the user is an admin. Very
similar to what you get when navigating through the UI.

In order to fetch vulnerabilities, the security scanner first has to
gather the layers to be inspected. In our case, we fetch this
information from the image manifest as given by the Registry.

This commit adds some code so the fetching of this manifest is safer.
For example, it will not freak out if a timeout was reached when
requesting the manifest from the registry.

This new endpoint lives inside of the user namespace and its main goal is to
allow people to create the first admin user from the API. This endpoint is only
allowed if the `first_user_admin` option has not been disabled. Another
restriction is that there shouldn't be a user already created. Last but not
least, this method can be called without being authenticated.

In the ideal case, you would call this method when you just started your Portus
instance. Then, you will get the first user created
(same arguments as `POST /api/v1/users`) and it will also get an application
token assigned to it. The reponse will be the `plain_token` from the application
token. Thus, the whole point of this method is to follow this workflow:

1. Portus instance deployed.
2. Admin uses this bootstrap endpoint to create the admin user and get an
   application token.
3. With this application token the admin starts to administrate the
   instance (e.g. register the registry on Portus) entirely from the API.
4. Admin makes the Portus instance available inside of the organization and
   starts structuring it inside of Portus.

Finally, this commit also started to make error responses more uniform. This was
firstly done to DRY some of the code created by this feature. It probably needs
more work (see #1437).

We have historically struggled with the synchronization of the Registry.
This was developed at first because the following situation could
happen:

1. User pushes image:tag.
2. Portus authorizes the transaction.
3. Registry sends the event to Portus with all the data, but Portus is
   unavailable.
4. Portus is up again but it missed the registry event.

This is not the case anymore, because all the things that could make
Portus unavailable have been either fixed or moved into the background
process. Thus, this problem can be ignored in most cases. Moreover, this
feature is quite dangerous because a bug on this code can make Portus
wipe all the repositories, and historically ""funny"" issues have
happened.

This commit builds upon #1631 where background tasks can be disabled.
Moreover, it also adds a `sync-strategy` option which is available when
users enable this feature. This option has four possible values:

- `update-delete`: the same behavior we've had up until now.
- `update`: similar to `update-delete` but this one will not delete
  repositories which no longer exist on the registry. This is useful for
  users which don't trust the risky `update-delete` strategy.
- `on-start`: execute `update-delete` only once (on start).
- `initial`: execute `update-delete` only once on start and
  only if the registry is empty. This is the default strategy since it
  might be convenient for new users that have already a running
  registry.

This commit does not fix all the issues mentioned in #1599, but it
hopefully does the trick for most users.

If registry events have happened while performing a sync, then cancel
this process altogether. This should fix situations like:

1. User pushes image:tag.
2. Background process executes sync (because the registry task has

3. Sync process marks image:tag as pushed by portus.

After a security scanning iteration, some tags might not be in a
:scan_done state. This is possible in situtations like:

- Clair was unavailable for some time because of a hiccup.
- There's an actual bug on the security scanning.

In these cases, we will check in the end of the iteration whether all
tags have been marked as scan. If this is not the case, then we will log
a warning and mark the failed tags as :scan_none (so in the next
iteration they can be picked up and hopefully be scanned properly this
time).

Two gems (bootstrap-sass & sass-rails) are only needed for compiling the
assets, so we will include them now in the `assets` group.

Moreover, we need to have the gems from the `assets` group as a
BuildRequires, otherwise the assets compilation might fail. That being
said, this commit also excludes these gems from the final bundle (i.e.
it discards these gems once assets have been compiled).

Finally, I've upgraded the `uglifier` gem to match the one from openSUSE
Factory.

The bundler version is determined by the one being used. This is the
ideal situation, but it turns out it's basically impossible to guarantee
that on Travis CI (we were using an ugly hack that does not work anymore
because they've updated stuff...).

So, the idea is that the bundler version being used doesn't matter that
much, and we are already using it on development, so we'll set it
directly when creating the spec file.

We are introducing the ability of writing javascript unit tests. Until now,
this wasn't possible.

To achieve that we decided to go with the mocha + webpack approach that
uses the `mocha-webpack` package. As the assertion library we choose
`expect`.

To run the tests you can simply type `yarn test`. And if you want the to check
the coverage, you can type `yarn coverage`.

There still stuff to be improved. The `.vue` files coverage does not work
properly and this is something that needs investigation."

Apparently in SLE 15 (and so Tumbleweed too) the default ruby will be
2.5 instead of 2.4 as we were told. This commit adds support for this
version and sets it as the default (so we anticipate the release).

This change involved a major change: devise had to be upgraded from
3.5.0 to 4.4.0. Devise was quite old and only in 4.4.0 it received some
fixes for this ruby version. Hence, this commit also includes quite some
changes to accomodate this upgrade.

Finally, I've also fixed some minor issues (e.g. the order of the errors
controller in the routes.rb file), and I've upgraded the rubocop version
so it catches the latests things from ruby 2.5 as well.

The migration part is now expected to be done by the administrator. This
is done automatically by the init script in containerized deployments.

This was done because now we had at least two portus processes accessing
the DB and trying to migrate the DB, which caused quite some issues.
Moreover, notice that the previous workflow (e.g. automatically
migrating on production) was simply not possible in orchestration
solutions like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.

Before this commit we were blindlessly deleting all empty files.
However, it appears that bundler/gem rely on empty files named
""gem.build_complete"" to check whether extensions were correctly built.
Before this commit, then, bundler/gem were complaining about extensions
not being available. This commit then fixes the delete command to
exclude these important empty files.

Moreover, this commit also include a couple of cleanups (e.g. removing
the unneeded node_modules.tar.gz heavy file).

packaging: changed how we build dependencies"
mssola,2018-01-03 11:53:24,https://api.github.com/repos/SUSE/Portus/git/commits/0970b9903af5bf1668ddb48ec9915f30e9e0902e,0970b9903af5bf1668ddb48ec9915f30e9e0902e,"packaging: changed how we build dependencies

This commit is a follow-up of bd383fba329b6256fdd0bb6d1a07fa98b12aeff0,
and it adapts all the packaging scripts on the idea that the Gemfile and
the Gemfile.lock files cannot be touched. After this commit, the portus
RPM builds again and it's cleaner than ever.

First of all, the `make_spec.sh` has been heavily modified, while
polishing some rough edges (e.g. proper debug functions). It will
require a specific bundler version, because now it will be taken from
the gem requirements instead of the `spec.in` file. The biggest change
is to only use `bundler` for anything related to gems. To list the gems
to be added as dependencies we are using now `bundle show`, which has
the knowledge of gem groups as defined in the previous commit. This way,
without modifying the Gemfile.lock file, we can properly filter the
dependencies. As a side-effect, this simplifies quite a lot the script.

As for the `portus.spec.in`, I have updated it so it uses gem groups,
and it will compile assets after fetching all gems (since it's the proper
order). Finally, I also added a couple of lines to remove all the
unneeded files/directories coming from vendored gems.

mssola,2018-01-02 15:45:34,https://api.github.com/repos/SUSE/Portus/git/commits/bd383fba329b6256fdd0bb6d1a07fa98b12aeff0,bd383fba329b6256fdd0bb6d1a07fa98b12aeff0,"packaging: do not modify the Gemfile file

Since the very beginning we've added some code blocks in the Gemfile
that run conditionally. This was bad practice but it worked for us. This
is no longer the case: current builds fail because bundle exits with a
non-zero code after checking that the Gemfile.lock produced is not the
same.

Thus, let's do things properly: use groups instead. I've done the
following:

- Removed the `packaging?` method since it's not needed anymore.
- Added an `assets` group that will be excluded when installing gems.
- Explicitely exclude `development` and `tests` instead of doing it on
  an ugly `unless` block.
- Removed the conditional on the `puma` gem. People are expected to run
  Portus with puma always.

Unless you provided enough Puma workers, there was a problem with HTTP
requests getting blocked. This is a similar issue as pointed out in #1353
with registry events.

The solution has been to move security scanning in the background, in a
different process. This is similar to #1353, but more polished (and if
this proves to really work we might move #1353 to this background runner
as well). Now the Tag model has two more columns: `vulnerabilities` and
`scanned`. The former contains the cached result of the latest security
check. The latter is an integer that can have three different values: 0
(scanning not performed), 1 (working on it) and 2 (scanning done). This
has also been exposed on the API, so the client side can be updated.

Even if the case sensitivity is set to true when you add a uniqueness
constraint in Ruby on Rails, it happens that in MariaDB/MySQL this is
not correctly handled when this constraint is coupled with another
column. In our case, the uniqueness constraint was between tag name and
repository. In this case, in MariaDB the evaluated key for the
uniqueness index was case insensitive (while in PostgreSQL everything
went as expected). This means that for two tags named ""tag"" and ""TAG""
and inside of the repository ""4"", the evaluated keys were ""tag-4"" and
""TAG-4"", and in MariaDB they were considered equal, hence it failed.

I've tried multiple solutions, but they all failed:

- Explicitly setting the case_sensitive property on the Rails' side.
- Changing the collation for the table, column, and combinations. This
  was successful locally but not on the CI server. Moreover, it broke
  the schema:load task.

The only solution left to us was to drop the `uniqueness` validator (and
the index with it) and write a custom one. This will certainly be slightly
inefficient, but it looks like we have no other option. Just to be sure,
I've added tests for this whole constraint mess, and for the other
constraints.

In the future we might evaluate removing MySQL support, since it's not
the first time that it has some downsides for the overall source code.
This is something to consider on the next major versions (where
breakages and manual migrations are to be expected).

The database configuration has been extended to also support PostgreSQL
as the database. This is relevant if you are using CoreOS Clair as the
security scanner and you don't want to have multiple databases.

In theory with this implementation we could have support for other RDBMs
as well, but that would mean to add gems for each support and call
`bundle`. To avoid these kinds of scenarios, we stick with just two options:
with MariaDB (the currently supported option) and PostgreSQL.

Currently we have a problem when a user is removed and added back
to Portus. The team and namespace associated with that user are not
removed. So, when an admin tries to create a user or an user tries
to create an account, an error mentioning that there's already a
namespace with that username is shown.

With this patch we avoid that by adding an incremental number to the
end of the name. For example, if username is ""brian"" and there's
already a namespace/team with that name, ""brian0"" namespace and team
will be created instead. If ""brian"" gets removed again, next time it
will be ""brian1"" for both namespace and team.

Remembering that we should remove this once we implement the
namespace/team removal."

With this commit administrators will be able to set the log level of
their Portus instance through the `PORTUS_LOG_LEVEL`. This will be
possible in production and staging, and it's meant to be used in
exceptional cases (e.g. something is really wrong with the `crono`
process and the administrator wants to restart it with `debug` mode for
a while).

In production it might happen that the crono process is started before
the portus process (e.g. a containerized setup with docker-compose or
Kubernetes). In such a case, we have to be sure that the process running
the migration is the main Portus one, because otherwise the `init`
script from portus won't be able to run successfully, and thus it won't
ever run `rake db:seed` on initialization.

don't want to put this burden into our CI process. For this, we will
have to upload the latest yarn.lock file in OBS as well.

With Ecmascript 6, the Javascript language is not as terrible as it used
to be (well, it still is a mess), so languages like Coffeescript are no
longer needed. Getting rid of this dependency means that it should be
easier to deploy (e.g. no execjs gem). Thus, it will give us thinner
deployments with the exact same functionality.

That being said, I've moved to Ecmascript 5 instead of 6, because not
all browsers support it. I could've integrated Babel into the
development, but it all seems immature in Rails 4.2 (e.g. no sprocket
support for this version to do the conversion automatically in
development). It may be possible, but I didn't want to get into too much
trouble for now.

I've done the move with the decaffeinate tool, and then translated it
into ecmascript 5 with Babel (I've left the configuration of Babel on
the package.json file as well). I've also added ESLint, which will be
run on Travis CI. The style has been borrowed from Airbnb and Gitlab,
but I don't have any strong opinions on the specific style really.

If we reinstall apache2, permissions and ownership of dir
/etc/apache2/ssl.key is reset to root and ""read only by user root""
which make user wwwrun not being able to use this key

wwwrun is the user which Portus runs and needs to access to that
certificate

We used to change the ownership and create a symlink, but as stated,
reinstalling apache2 changes the ownership back.

Thus, the solution is to do it the other way around, move the key
outside apache dirs and instead create a symlink

One usual pain point that can be solved in `make_valid` is that lots of times
the problem is with the case. Since upper case is not accepted in namespace
names, then it will be converted weirdly. Because of this, from now on the
first thing that `make_valid` will do if the name doesn't match right away, is
to convert the name to downcase. With this commit then, something like `Miquel`
will be converted to `miquel`, instead of `_iquel`, which makes more sense.

This has been done in two steps:

1. First of all I've introduced the `namespace_id` column to the `users`
   table. This means that from now own there is no mapping from users and their
   personal namespaces through the `username` column, from now on it's done with
   a plain SQL foreign key.
2. From the previous step, we get that restricting the username is no longer
   needed. Instead, the format of the username has been greatly relaxed, so the
   only concerns are:
    - It is unique in the DB.
    - We can produce a namespace for it. If the username is not a valid
      namespace name, then the resulting namespace will have its name altered
      so it can be valid. If it cannot be valid, then user creation will fail
      (which is very unlikely: this only happens in cases like ""?"" or something
       like that).

From now on, users will be able to introduce a ""display name"". This display
name will be the one shown on the website. The main goal of this feature is to
allow users to see names on the website that are more familiar to them (e.g.
users coming from LDAP but that have an ""ugly"" username there).

Notice that this ""display name"" is only used on the web site, not in the
`docker login` procedure. Because of this, and because it might confuse people,
this configuration option is disabled by default.

Soft delete support has been supported in Docker Distribution since at least
2.1. This was not enough to implement the removal of images/tags in Portus
because there was no support to GC these soft deleted blobs. Since 2.4, it's
possible to not just delete the manifest, but also to GC blobs no longer
referenced by any image manifest. This means that after being able to track
digests, we can now safely provide image/tag removal support. For safety
concerns, tags with an empty digest will not be allowed to be removed (this
is more likely to be the case of Portus versions that have been running for
some time). In previous PRs this has already been addressed, so admins can
update their DB filling in the empty gaps (e.g. see PRs #825 or #830).

The main downside of this change is that there is no way for a client to detect
whether a remote registry supports GC. Because of this, a configuration option
has been provided, which is disabled by default. The rationale is that
administrators that are really sure about the availability of GC on their
private registry will have to enable it explicitly.

This is the same Image ID that is shown in the docker client. In order to do
this, a new column has been added to the `tags` table. The registry client has
also been modified to handle all this more gracefully. The image ID being
shown is truncated in the exact same format as in the Docker client. That
being
said, users can hover the mouse over the image ID and they'll get the full
image ID.

This commit is the foundation for integration testing in the Portus repository.
It uses docker containers to setup everything, and a lot of magic has been
written around RSpec so it integrates with the style of the other tests.

This commit does not handle on purpose the following (which have been submitted
as separate issues):

  - Test multiple versions of Docker.
  - Test crono
  - Test portusctl
  - Cover as much of the registry client as possible
  - Add integration testing into CI

Up until now we allowed users to have the same username as some teams. This is
troublesome because then the private team assigned to this user would clash
with the existing one.

In the future we should figure out a way to better handle these hidden teams
(e.g. by creating one with a random name and the reference it on the user row).
For now, in order to not be too disruptive we will disallow creating users with
the same name as an existing team (note that the other way around is also
disallowed).

Whenever a manifest gets deleted, the registry will send a ""delete"" event to
Portus. In this commit Portus will be able to react to these events
accordingly: remove specified tag if available, and remove the repository if
it's left empty of tags.

Package name should be portus and not Portus. This rename was necessary
to overcome an issue with the version of the package (see previous
commits).

However, we fixed the package name (and the obsoletes tags) in the spec
file *after* setting the tag 2.0.3, thus we need to fix it in the release
script for this version.

When we release next version from master we'll be able to clean this.

Also, rename Portus.spec.in to portus.spec.in, plus some other
refactoring.

According to the official spec the scope parameter can be passed more than
once: ""This query parameter should be specified multiple times ifthere is more
than one scope entry from the WWW-Authenticate header"".
At least the latest docker daemon 1.10.0 does use multiple scope parameters in
a single token request (e.g. when pushing multiple tags in parallel).

Additionaly this commit changes the token endpoint to not return
""401 Unauthorized"" on any kind of authorization error, only authentication
errors should return 401 errors.
This also conforms with the spec: ""If the client only has a subset of the
requested access it must not be considered an error as it is not the
responsibility of the token server to indicate authorization errors as part of
this workflow.""

Fixed Registry synchronization with v2 manifests"
mssola,2016-02-11 10:44:57,https://api.github.com/repos/SUSE/Portus/git/commits/552df9caa34181ce0c73f9b3b3491cd637b28c92,552df9caa34181ce0c73f9b3b3491cd637b28c92,"Fixed Registry synchronization with v2 manifests

In the new manifest Version 2, schema 2; some fields are missing. In this case,
the ""tag"" field is no longer available as of this version. We used that because
the notification from the registry does not provide such information for now
(hopefully there will be a solution for Distribution 2.4). Thus, we pulled the
manifest and extracted the tag from there.

The code now detects the version of the manifest schema. If it's the latest
one, then we will fetch the tags of the given repo and compare them with what
we've got in the database.

Note that this solution could also be applied to the version 2 schema 1, but
fetching the manifest is faster and less prone to possible sync errors (even
though hese errors are not really important if crono is in place).

Moreover, I've added a table on the README.md file describing which versions of
Portus implement what.

repos. This happens when, for some unexpected reason, the
`RegistryClient#add_tags` method fails at retrieving one repository. In this
case, before this patch this method just returned an empty array. After this
patch, repositories that are not found will simply not be added, but the
method will go on adding tags to other repositories.

Before this commit, the crono job kept on adding the log into the `log` column
from the `crono_jobs` table. This is, of course, a bad thing. What I did to fix
this is to simply remove this columns from the DB, and crono is ok with that.
Running crono again with this patch runs in the very same way as it used to be,
but without adding the log all the time.

Moreover, the log is supposed to go to the stdout, as envisioned by the
Twelve-Factor App manifesto: http://12factor.net. Docker follows this too, and
by doing so then the log of this job blends in with docker-compose logs
command. This has two main consequences:

1. The user can decide how to manage logs in an easier way, so there's no way
   that we run out of disk (an issue we were having).
2. supervisor is no longer needed. Instead, we take advantage of the
   compose-setup.sh script to do it properly. Before this patch, for some
   reason the catalog job did not reach the db container.

Right now the Docker client stores the credentials in plain
format on the host. This is really bad from a security point of view,
especially for users using LDAP to authenticated.

This commit introduces the concept of ""application tokens"". Each user
can have at most 5 application tokens. The tokens are created in a
random secure way by Portus and are stored inside of its database after
being hashed via bcrypt.

The application tokens can be used by all the programs authenticating
against a Docker registry protected by Portus (e.g.: the docker cli
client). They cannot be used to log into Portus' web interface.

The application tokens can be revoked at any time by using a new UI.

After debugging it, we found out that on our test machine RUBYLIB was
set as

/usr/lib64/ruby/gems/2.1.0/gems/bundler-1.10.6/lib/

which was causing bundler not being able to run, since this is a
different version than the one we have in /srv/Portus/vendor/....

My guess is that this is because of rubygem-bundler being installed on
that system.

This commit sets that environment variable to our bundler directory.

This fixes the setup on environments that already set the DOCKER_HOST
environment variable. Since this variable can be set to something like
""tcp://IP:POR"", the final message cleans up everything so only the IP is shown
together with the proper ports.

I've also cleaned up the final message so it's more well-formatted and verbose.

It doesn't make sense for LDAP users to recover passwords this way, since
Portus acts just as a proxy between users and the LDAP server when it comes to
authentication.

Since this was exactly the same as for the signup page, I've put the code
inside of a concern that bith the RegistrationsController and the

Users can remove themselves from a team, and owners can step down as owners of
a team. In these cases, it's weird to see a message like ""mssola removed user
mssola ..."". Instead, now the same message will say ""mssola removed itself
..."".

Moreover, in the case of removing a team member, it's weird in my opinion to
state the old role of that user. So, comparing on the removal of a team member:

- before: ""mssola removed user mssola with role owner from the docker team""
- after:  ""mssola removed itself from the docker team""

This removes some complexity on the code o the frontend side. Moreover, this is
what sites like Github do. If the users submit an empty space, then they'll get
nothing, which is fine.

This is known to be problematic, since our docker compose setup expects the
portus_web container to be created. The problem that this is based on the pwd
alone. It's not possible to specify a name for this, as reported on the
following issue: https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/2092.

Before this patch, a ""public"" namespace allowed pulls to any Portus user.
However, it did not allow pull access to anonymous users.

After this patch, the TokensController won't authenticate every user, but only
those that have called the `docker login` command. From now on, it's up to
each
policy to allow/disallow anonymous users. In particular, the only one that
allows access to anonymous users is the Namespace policy, and it only does it
for pull requests.

Moreover, the UI toggles have now a title that tells the user that by making a
namespace public, anyone will be able to pull.

When creating a new registry, Portus will now check whether it's reachable or
not. If it is, it will continue as usual. However, if it's not reachable, then
Portus will redirect to the registries#new page and alert the user with some
useful message. When this redirect happens, the user will have available an
extra checkbox called ""Skip remote checks"". If the user checks it, then it's
telling to Portus to force the creation of the registry, even if it's not
reachable.

This fixes a regression in which users could not create registries because the
sanitized namespace for it was incorrect. I've decided to go for a simple
approach when it comes to name validations:

* repository and tag: don't validate the format, since we are creating these
  objects directly from the registry, which guarantees us that the names will
  be well-formatted.
* registry: don't validate it, since the name of it won't be used for creating
  the internal team/namespace for a created registry anymore. The names of
  registry's team/namespace are neither shown or used, so let's use a unique
  identifier for it and that's it.
* namespace: validate the format exactly as specified by Docker. This no longer
  conflicts with the creation of the registry, as mentioned above.

portusctl runs as root user when there's no log/production.log. That
causes the production.log to be created by the root user and owned by
the root group. That makes impossible for passenger to write messages
to it.

An admin will be able from now on to edit both the `name` and the `use_ssl`
attributes from a registry. The `hostname` attribute will only be available for
update if there are no repositories in the system yet. This is done this way to
prevent the admin from performing unsafe actions, while allowing some
flexibility when setting up Portus for the first time.

This way we can get more info about what has failed when requesting the JWT
token in production. I've reviewed all the other logged messages, and they all
seem to have the proper log level.

Note that another sensitive part is when Portus tries to fetch the manifest
after a web event has occurred. This is already handled properly by the
`Registry#get_tag_from_manifest` method.

mssola,2015-09-29 09:35:45,https://api.github.com/repos/SUSE/Portus/git/commits/71c84b87f8a77f1359c1641e213fcffd7c6ab45c,71c84b87f8a77f1359c1641e213fcffd7c6ab45c,"registry: return the proper error when fetching the manifest fails

As noted by @morodin in the issue #338, when Portus fails the fetch the
manifest, it adds a new tag ""1"" into the database. This is due to a regression
introduced in 09dc052721ad560e4fb56c585f6193d3305fc578. In this case, on
failure the `get_tag_from_manifest` method returned true on error, because
that's what the logger returns. This commit makes sure that in this case nil is
returned.

Moreover, Portus will now also log the error that has happenned when fetching
the manifest.

This fixes some known issues like the setup of the appliance, in which the
Portus instance and the registry just couldn't speak to each other.

In order to do this, the `use_ssl` attribute has been introduced. This
attribute can be changed in the ""registries#show"" page in the form of a toggle
box. There's also a checkbox that allows the admin to set `use_ssl` as true
when creating a new registry.

Moreover, this commit also brings some needed cleaning in regards to classes
dealing with registries.

As expected, the Net::LDAP class supports this seamlessly. Moreover, the added
configuration is minimal: there is now the ""method"" configurable value with
three possible values (""plain"", ""simple_tls"" and ""starttls"").

I'd say that ""plain"" is the best default, since it's the easiest to configure
from a server point of view. However, the recommended choice is ""starttls"",
as described in the documentation of this newly added value.

I've also relaxed a rubocop rule. I plan to fix this as soon as possible.

There were some issues with tests requiring LDAP to be enabled. To fix that,
LDAP will be enabled always for the test suite. However, the test suite mocks
away the Portus::LDAP class so the `authenticate!` method fails gracefully for
regular tests. Tests that require the legit version of the `authenticate!`
method have to call the following inside the `before(:each)` block:

```ruby
allow_any_instance_of(Portus::LDAP).to receive(:authenticate!).and_call_original

The notifications system consisted of an abstraction of three classes. Those
classes were a bit magical and weren't documented. My approach has been to
simplify all of this and implementing it all in one library class. This makes
sense because all the notifications that we catch are `repository` related
anyways.

The RegistryClient will pick the ""portus"" user by default, which is what we
want anyways usually.

Distribution changed the format of event notifications. In particular, the tag
is no longer provided inside the URL. This is a good move since it's safer to
point by digest. However it affected us because we retrieved tags from this
URL. From now on, we'll take advantage of this digest to call the Manifest API
and fetch the tag.

I've also submitted an issue on Docker Distribution about providing a better
solution for this (so we don't have to call the Manifest API everytime).

If we have the following configuration:

```yaml
ldap:
  enabled: true
```

Now there is another way to change that besides using a `config-local.yml`
file. That's by using the proper environment variable. For the previous case,
the environment variable would be `PORTUS_LDAP_ENABLED`. Therefore, all these
environment variables start with ""PORTUS"", and then they follow the keys.

Moreover, now the accepted configurable values are tied to the `config.yml`
file. Therefore, any other value set by either the `config-local.yml` file or
an environment variable will be properly ignored.

In order to do this, the previous `disable` method has been transformed into
the `toggle_enabled` method. This method transparently toggles the enabled
column accordingly. This has involved quite some changes on the code (plus, it
has been moved to the model, instead of keeping the controller fat).

On the admin page, both enabled/disabled users are displayed, so the admin has
the ultimate power to enable users back.

Fixes #245

The commit 05eb390776ee699e74947ccf19b2d58e642f22c5 introduces a regression in
which a logged in user can pull a repo from a private namespace that doesn't
belong to it.

The problem is that the delete_if method is screwing with the `each` iteration.
To avoid this, the returned scopes from `scope_handler` is a duplicate, instead
of being the same object.

It was discovered that the upstream library for uglifier Gem for Ruby,
UglifyJS, versions 2.4.23 and earlier, was affected by a vulnerability

functionality after minification. This bug was demonstrated to allow
potentially malicious code to be hidden within secure code, activated
by minification.

The authorization protocol changed with Docker 1.8:
  * client does pull or push or whatever
  * daemon does ping to registry i.e. https://registry.ip/v2/
  * registry returns 401 along with realm and service, but not scope
  * daemon asks for a token from the auth server, with
    service=<registry>&scope=repository:namespace/image:push,pull

In other words, the daemon always asks for push,pull, even if you are
just doing a pull. The auth server is supposed to respond in the
following fashion:

  * If unauthenticated access is not allowed, return a 401 requiring
user to authentictae
  * If unauthenticated access is allowed to that repo, return a web
token

When user tries the token path against the auth server with credentials:

  * If invalid credentials, return 401
  * If valid credentials, always return a 200 with a JWT that has the
    maximum credentials allowed this user on this repository in this service
    that is a subset of the scope provided.

The daemon will always ask for push,pull, and - as long as I am validly
authenticated - the auth server should always return 200 with a valid
Web token. The Web token will list the max I am allowed.

  * If I am not allowed push or pull, then return a token with no access
  * If I am allowed pull but not push, then return a token with pull
    access only
  * If I am allowed pull and push, then return a token with push and
    pull access

This way we have a separation of:

- http_helpers: HTTP helpers and methods for the authentication process.
- registry_client: just the methods dealing with the endpoints themselves.

Moreover, the `get_request` method has been renamed to `perform_request`, since
now it's capable of performing any HTTP method. This has been done so it's
easier to implement features that are still pending to be implemented like
deleting images."

The portus user has to be handled transparently behind the scenes. This means
that it must not be listed in the users list for admins, and it has to be
hidden when dealing with authentication.

Moreover, the admin will have a notice in the dashboard if the Portus user is
not there. This should never happen since the portus user is installed always
by seeding it. This would mean that there's something really wrong with the DB
(some manual update gone wrong)."

Up until now, the portus ""user"" was handled in a special way, by adding some
code that worked around the whole authentication mechanism. However, we
recently discovered that this was basically broken.

The solution to this situation is to effectively create the ""portus"" user, as
any other user in the system. Because of this, I've added a new secret, which
is the password of the ""portus"" user, and I have added a rake task to help with
the migration. Moreover, the seeds file already takes care of that. With this
commit, the `manifest` method from the RegisterClient works again, and the
authentication mechanism has been greatly simplified.

There are still some small issues that need to be addressed. This will be done
in later commits."

Soon we are going to fetch informations from the registry itself (like
repositories' manifests). When doing that we have to authenticate
against the registry like all normal clients. Basically Portus is going to
authenticate against itself. :)

The client library used to interact with the registry is already merged
in master (see `app/models/registry_client.rb`). However we still have
to provide a username and password. Hence we need to send the password
as a client, and then verify itself inside of the token controller.

We are going to authenticate as 'portus' user providing a time based one
time only password (aka TOTP).
The TOTP is generated using a secret that changes every time the Rails process
starts (see `config/application.rb`).

The policy checks inside of the token controller have been disabled for the
'portus' user because he can access to everything.s

I've also reserved 'portus' as username to avoid misuses from the users."

Devise does not redirect to the 'new' page on signup error, but it renders it.
This means that on signup error the `@admin` view variable will be nil, thus
showing the ""Create Admin"" button. In this commit a before_filter has been
added for both the 'new' and the 'create' actions, so this case is always
handled consistently.

When packaging this application as for example an RPM, we need to know
which gems are needed, which means we don't want to have devel or test
gems.

While you can run ""bundle install --without development test"", this
does not update the Gemfile.lock, meaning the develoment and test gems
are still in Gemfile.lock.

If you infere the gem dependencies from the Gemfile.lock, you would get
the development and test gems, unless you exclude them inside the
Gemfile file.

This commits adds a ""unless ENV['PACKAGING'] == 'yes'"" that excludes the
gems in the Gemfile thus, if you run

PACKAGING=yes bundle list

you will get the Gemfile.lock that you need without the test and
development dependencies and thus you can use that for infering which
gems you will need in production and thus set the package requirements."
