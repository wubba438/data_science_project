When nginx is used with zlib patched with [1], which provides
integration with the future IBM Z hardware deflate acceleration, it ends
up computing CRC32 twice: one time in hardware, which always does this,

However, since then gzip wrapping was implemented in zlib v1.2.0.4,

In case of filter finalization, essential request fields like r->uri,

Also, after filter finalization r->cache could be set to NULL, leading to
null pointer dereference in ngx_http_upstream_cache_background_update().
The fix is to create background cache update subrequest before sending the
cached response.

Since initial introduction in 1aeaae6e9446 (1.11.10) background cache update
subrequest was created after sending the cached response because otherwise it
blocked the parent request output.  In 9552758a786e (1.13.1) background
subrequests were introduced to eliminate the delay before sending the final
part of the cached response.  This also made it possible to create the
background cache update subrequest before sending the response.

Note that creating the subrequest earlier does not change the fact that in case
of filter finalization the background cache update subrequest will likely not
have enough time to successfully update the cache entry.  Filter finalization
leads to the main request termination as soon the current iteration of request
processing is complete."

In ngx_http_range_singlepart_body() special buffers where passed
unmodified, including ones after the end of the range.  As such,
if the last buffer of a response was sent separately as a special

In particular, this might result in a duplicate final chunk when using
chunked transfer encoding (normally range filter and chunked transfer
encoding are not used together, but this may happen if there are trailers
in the response).  This also likely to cause problems in HTTP/2.

Fix is to skip all special buffers after we've sent the last part of
the range requested.  These special buffers are not meaningful anyway,
since we set b->last_buf in the buffer with the last part of the range,
and everything is expected to be flushed due to it.

Additionally, ngx_http_next_body_filter() is now called even
if no buffers are to be passed to it.  This ensures that various
write events are properly propagated through the filter chain.  In

Filters are not allowed to change incoming chain links, and should allocate
their own links if any modifications are needed.  Nevertheless
ngx_http_range_singlepart_body() modified incoming chain links in some
cases, notably at the end of the requested range.

No problems caused by this are currently known, mostly because of
limited number of possible modifications and the position of the range
body filter in the filter chain.  Though this behaviour is clearly incorrect
and tests demonstrate that it can at least cause some proxy buffers being
lost when using proxy_force_ranges, leading to less effective handling
of responses.

Fix is to always allocate new chain links in ngx_http_range_singlepart_body().
Links are explicitly freed to ensure constant memory usage with long-lived

Postpone filter is an essential part of subrequest functionality.  In absence
of it a subrequest response body is sent to the client out of order with

For in-memory subrequests the response is also sent to the client instead of
being stored in memory.

Currently the postpone filter is automatically enabled if one of the following
standard modules which are known to create subrequests is enabled: ssi, slice,
addition.  However a third-party module that creates subrequests can still be
built without the postpone filter or be dynamically loaded in nginx built
without it."

The ""(SSL:)"" snippet currently appears in logs when nginx code uses
ngx_ssl_error() to log an error, but OpenSSL's error queue is empty.
This can happen either because the error wasn't in fact from OpenSSL,
or because OpenSSL did not indicate the error in the error queue
for some reason.

In particular, currently ""(SSL:)"" can be seen in errors at least in
the following cases:

- When SSL_write() fails due to a syscall error,
  ""[info] ... SSL_write() failed (SSL:) (32: Broken pipe)..."".

- When loading a certificate with no data in it,
  ""[emerg] PEM_read_bio_X509_AUX(...) failed (SSL:)"".
  This can easily happen due to an additional empty line before
  the end line, so all lines of the certificate are interpreted
  as header lines.

- When trying to configure an unknown curve,
  ""[emerg] SSL_CTX_set1_curves_list(""foo"") failed (SSL:)"".

Likely there are other cases as well.

With this change, ""(SSL:...)"" will be only added to the error message
if there is something in the error queue.  This is expected to make
logs more readable in the above cases.  Additionally, with this change
it is now possible to use ngx_ssl_error() to log errors when some
of the possible errors are not from OpenSSL and not expected to have
anything in the error queue."

On Windows, connect() errors are only reported via exceptfds descriptor set
from select().  Previously exceptfds was set to NULL, and connect() errors
were not detected at all, so connects to closed ports were waiting till
a timeout occurred.

Since ongoing connect() means that there will be a write event active,
except descriptor set is copied from the write one.  While it is possible
to construct except descriptor set as a concatenation of both read and write
descriptor sets, this looks unneeded.

With this change, connect() errors are properly detected now when using
select().  Note well that it is not possible to detect connect() errors with
WSAPoll() (see https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2012/10/10/wsapoll-is-broken/)."

In e3ba4026c02d (1.15.4) nginx own renegotiation checks were disabled
if SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION is available.  But since SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION
is only set on a connection, not in an SSL context, SSL_clear_option()
removed it as long as a matching virtual server was found.  This resulted
in a segmentation fault similar to the one fixed in a6902a941279 (1.9.8),
affecting nginx built with OpenSSL 1.1.0h or higher.

To fix this, SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION is now explicitly set in
ngx_http_ssl_servername() after adjusting options.  Additionally, instead
of c->ssl->renegotiation we now check c->ssl->handshaked, which seems
to be a more correct flag to test, and will prevent the segmentation fault
from happening even if SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION is not working."

The ""no suitable signature algorithm"" errors are reported by OpenSSL 1.1.1
when using TLSv1.3 if there are no shared signature algorithms.  In
particular, this can happen if the client limits available signature
algorithms to something we don't have a certificate for, or to an empty
list.  For example, the following command:

    openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:8443 -sigalgs rsa_pkcs1_sha1

will always result in the ""no suitable signature algorithm"" error
as the ""rsa_pkcs1_sha1"" algorithm refers solely to signatures which
appear in certificates and not defined for use in TLS 1.3 handshake
messages.

The SSL_R_NO_COMMON_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHMS error is what BoringSSL returns
in the same situation."

The ""no suitable key share"" errors are reported by OpenSSL 1.1.1 when
using TLSv1.3 if there are no shared groups (that is, elliptic curves).
In particular, it is easy enough to trigger by using only a single
curve in ssl_ecdh_curve:

    ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;

and using a different curve in the client:

    openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:443 -curves prime256v1

On the client side it is seen as ""sslv3 alert handshake failure"",
""SSL alert number 40"":

0:error:14094410:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:sslv3 alert handshake failure:ssl/record/rec_layer_s3.c:1528:SSL alert number 40

It can be also triggered with default ssl_ecdh_curve by using a curve
which is not in the default list (X25519, prime256v1, X448, secp521r1,
secp384r1):

    openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:8443 -curves brainpoolP512r1

Given that many clients hardcode prime256v1, these errors might become
a common problem with TLSv1.3 if ssl_ecdh_curve is redefined.  Previously
this resulted in not using ECDH with such clients, but with TLSv1.3 it
is no longer possible and will result in a handshake failure.

The SSL_R_NO_SHARED_GROUP error is what BoringSSL returns in the same
situation.

Trying to look into r->err_status in the ""return"" directive
makes it behave differently than real errors generated in other
parts of the code, and is an endless source of various problems.
This behaviour was introduced in 726:7b71936d5299 (0.4.4) with
the comment ""fix: ""return"" always overrode ""error_page"" response code"".
It is not clear if there were any real cases this was expected to fix,
but there are several cases which are broken due to this change, some
previously fixed (4147:7f64de1cc2c0).

In ticket #1634, the problem is that when r->err_status is set to
a non-special status code, it is not possible to return a response
by simply returning r->err_status.  If this is the case, the only
option is to return script's e->status instead.  An example
configuration:

    location / {
        error_page 404 =200 /err502;
        return 404;
    }

    location = /err502 {
        return 502;
    }

After the change, such a configuration will properly return
standard 502 error, much like it happens when a 502 error is
generated by proxy_pass.

This also fixes the following configuration to properly close
connection as clearly requested by ""return 444"":

    location / {
        error_page 404 /close;
        return 404;
    }

    location = /close {
        return 444;
    }

Previously, this required ""error_page 404 = /close;"" to work
as intended."

Socket leak was observed in the following configuration:

    error_page 400 = /close;

    location = /close {
        return 444;
    }

The problem is that ""return 444"" triggers termination of the request,
and due to error_page termination thinks that it needs to use a posted
request to clear stack.  But at the early request processing where 400
errors are generated there are no ngx_http_run_posted_requests() calls,
so the request is only terminated after an external event.

Variants of the problem include ""error_page 497"" instead (ticket #695)
and various other errors generated during early request processing
(405, 414, 421, 494, 495, 496, 501, 505).

The same problem can be also triggered with ""return 499"" and ""return 408""
as both codes trigger ngx_http_terminate_request(), much like ""return 444"".

To fix this, the patch adds ngx_http_run_posted_requests() calls to
ngx_http_process_request_line() and ngx_http_process_request_headers()
functions, and to ngx_http_v2_run_request() and ngx_http_v2_push_stream()
functions in HTTP/2.

Since the ngx_http_process_request() function is now only called via
other functions which call ngx_http_run_posted_requests(), the call
there is no longer needed and was removed."

messages were replaced with ""SSL_read: want write"" and ""SSL_write: want read""
debug ones.

This doesn't really matter in lingering close, as we shutdown write side
of the socket anyway and also disable renegotiation (and even without shutdown
and with renegotiation it requires using very large certificate chain and
tuning socket buffers to trigger SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE).  But for the sake of
correctness added an NGX_AGAIN check."

With this change, ngx_copy_file() always calls ngx_set_file_time(),

Negative times can appear since workers only update time on an event
loop iteration start.  If a worker was blocked for a long time during
an event loop iteration, it is possible that another worker already
updated the time stored in the node.  As such, time since last update
of the node (ms) will be negative.

Previous code used ngx_abs(ms) in the calculations.  That is, negative
times were effectively treated as positive ones.  As a result, it was
not possible to maintain high request rates, where the same node can be
updated multiple times from during an event loop iteration.
In particular, this affected setups with many SSL handshakes, see
http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2018-May/056291.html.

Fix is to only update the last update time stored in the node if the
new time is larger than previously stored one.  If a future time is
stored in the node, we preserve this time as is.

To prevent breaking things on platforms without monotonic time available
if system time is updated backwards, a safety limit of 60 seconds is
used.  If the time stored in the node is more than 60 seconds in the future,
we assume that the time was changed backwards and update lr->last
to the current time."

The gRPC protocol makes a distinction between HEADERS frame with
the END_STREAM flag set, and a HEADERS frame followed by an empty
DATA frame with the END_STREAM flag.  The latter is not permitted,

gRPC clients complain that ""server closed the stream without sending
trailers"" (seen in grpc-go) or ""13: Received RST_STREAM with error
code 2"" (seen in grpc-c).

To fix this, nginx now returns HEADERS with the END_STREAM flag if
the response length is known to be 0, and we are not expecting
any trailer headers to be added.  And the response length is
explicitly set to 0 in the gRPC proxy if we see initial HEADERS frame

Following ad3f342f14ba046c (1.9.13), it is possible that a request where
header was already sent will be finalized with NGX_HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY,
triggering an attempt to return additional error response and the
""header already sent"" alert as a result.

In particular, it is trivial to reproduce the problem with a HEAD request
and caching enabled.  With caching enabled nginx will change HEAD to GET
and will set u->pipe->downstream_error to suppress sending the response
body to the client.  When a backend-related error occurs (for example,
proxy_read_timeout expires), ngx_http_finalize_upstream_request() will
be called with NGX_HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY.  After ad3f342f14ba046c this will
result in ngx_http_finalize_request(NGX_HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY).

Fix is to move u->pipe->downstream_error handling to a later point,
where all special response codes are changed to NGX_ERROR.

A zlib variant from Intel as available from https://github.com/jtkukunas/zlib

also uses 16-byte padding in one of the window-sized memory buffers, and can
force window bits to 13 if compression level is set to 1 and appropriate
compile options are used.  As a result, nginx complained with ""gzip filter

This change improves deflate_state allocation detection by testing that
items is 1 (deflate_state is the only allocation where items is 1).
Additionally, on first failure to use preallocated memory we now assume
that we are working with the Intel's modified zlib, and switch to using
appropriate preallocations.  If this does not help, we complain with the
usual alerts.

record headers are written in a single buffer, this still can happen in real

and the second packet will be delayed.

Also, added appropriate logging of this and NGX_HTTP_UPSTREAM_INVALID_HEADER
cases at the ""crit"" level.  Note that this will result in duplicate logging
in case of NGX_HTTP_UPSTREAM_INVALID_HEADER.  While this is something better
to avoid, it is considered to be an overkill to implement cache-specific
error logging in u->process_header().

Additionally, u->buffer.start is now reset to be able to receive a new
response, and u->cache_status set to MISS to provide the value in the
$upstream_cache_status variable, much like it happens on other cache file
errors detected by ngx_http_file_cache_read(), instead of HIT, which is
believed to be misleading."

The overflow can be used to circumvent the restriction on total size of

allows producing ranges with negative start (such ranges can be created
by using a suffix, ""bytes=-100""; normally this results in 200 due to

It is believed that there are no other negative effects, at least with
standard nginx modules.

In theory, this can also result in memory disclosure and/or segmentation
faults if multiple ranges are allowed, and the response is returned in a
single in-memory buffer.  This never happens with standard nginx modules
though, as well as known 3rd party modules.

Previously, the upstream resolve handler always called
ngx_http_run_posted_requests() to run posted requests after processing the
resolver response.  However, if the handler was called directly from the
ngx_resolve_name() function (for example, if the resolver response was cached),
running posted requests from the handler could lead to the following errors:

- If the request was scheduled for termination, it could actually be terminated
in the resolve handler.  Upper stack frames could reference the freed request
object in this case.

- If a significant number of requests were posted, and for each of them the
resolve handler was called directly from the ngx_resolve_name() function,
posted requests could be run recursively and lead to stack overflow.

Now ngx_http_run_posted_requests() is only called from asynchronously invoked

With ""proxy_ignore_client_abort off"" (the default), upstream module changes
r->read_event_handler to ngx_http_upstream_rd_check_broken_connection().
If the handler is not cleared during upstream finalization, it can be
triggered later, causing unexpected effects, if, for example, a request
was redirected to a different location using error_page or X-Accel-Redirect.
In particular, it makes ""proxy_ignore_client_abort on"" non-working after
a redirection in a configuration like this:

    location = / {
        error_page 502 = /error;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8082;

http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-ru/2015-August/056570.html.

The ngx_event_pipe() function wasn't called on write events with
wev->delayed set.  As a result, threaded writing results weren't
properly collected in ngx_event_pipe_write_to_downstream() when a
write event was triggered for a completed write.

Further, this wasn't detected, as p->aio was reset by a thread completion
handler, and results were later collected in ngx_event_pipe_read_upstream()
instead of scheduling a new write of additional data.  If this happened
on the last reading from an upstream, last part of the response was never
written to the cache file.

Similar problems might also happen in case of timeouts when writing to
client, as this also results in ngx_event_pipe() not being called on write
events.  In this scenario socket leaks were observed.

Fix is to check if p->writing is set in ngx_event_pipe_read_upstream(), and
therefore collect results of previous write operations in case of read events
as well, similar to how we do so in ngx_event_pipe_write_downstream().
This is enough to fix the wev->delayed case.  Additionally, we now call
ngx_event_pipe() from ngx_http_upstream_process_request() if there are
uncollected write operations (p->writing and !p->aio).  This also fixes
the wev->timedout case."

The ngx_chain_coalesce_file() function may produce more bytes to send then
requested in the limit passed, as it aligns the last file position
to send to memory page boundary.  As a result, (limit - send) may become
negative.  This resulted in big positive number when converted to size_t
while calling ngx_output_chain_to_iovec().

Another part of the problem is in ngx_chain_coalesce_file(): it changes cl
to the next chain link even if the current buffer is only partially sent
due to limit.

Therefore, if a file buffer was not expected to be fully sent due to limit,
and was followed by a memory buffer, nginx called sendfile() with a part
of the file buffer, and the memory buffer in trailer.  If there were enough
room in the socket buffer, this resulted in a part of the file buffer being
skipped, and corresponding part of the memory buffer sent instead.

The bug was introduced in 8e903522c17a (1.7.8).  Configurations affected
are ones using limits, that is, limit_rate and/or sendfile_max_chunk, and
memory buffers after file ones (may happen when using subrequests or
with proxying with disk buffering).

Fix is to explicitly check if (send < limit) before constructing trailer
with ngx_output_chain_to_iovec().  Additionally, ngx_chain_coalesce_file()
was modified to preserve unfinished file buffers in cl."

A bug was introduced by 82efcedb310b that could lead to timing out of
responses or segmentation fault, when accept_mutex was enabled.

The output queue in HTTP/2 can contain frames from different streams.
When the queue is sent, all related write handlers need to be called.
In order to do so, the streams were added to the h2c->posted queue
after handling sent frames.  Then this queue was processed in
ngx_http_v2_write_handler().

If accept_mutex is enabled, the event's ""ready"" flag is set but its
handler is not called immediately.  Instead, the event is added to
the ngx_posted_events queue.  At the same time in this queue can be
events from upstream connections.  Such events can result in sending
output queue before ngx_http_v2_write_handler() is triggered.  And
at the time ngx_http_v2_write_handler() is called, the output queue
can be already empty with some streams added to h2c->posted.

But after 82efcedb310b, these streams weren't processed if all frames
have already been sent and the output queue was empty.  This might lead
to a situation when a number of streams were get stuck in h2c->posted
queue for a long time.  Eventually these streams might get closed by
the send timeout.

In the worst case this might also lead to a segmentation fault, if
already freed stream was left in the h2c->posted queue.  This could
happen if one of the streams was terminated but wasn't closed, due to
the HEADERS frame or a partially sent DATA frame left in the output
queue.  If this happened the ngx_http_v2_filter_cleanup() handler
removed the stream from the h2c->waiting or h2c->posted queue on
termination stage, before the frame has been sent, and the stream
was again added to the h2c->posted queue after the frame was sent.

In order to fix all these problems and simplify the code, write
events of fake stream connections are now added to ngx_posted_events
instead of using a custom h2c->posted queue."

For Perl compiled with threads, without PERL_SET_INTERP() the PL_curinterp
remains set to the first interpreter created (that is, one created at
original start).  As a result after a reload Perl thinks that operations
are done withing a thread, and, most notably, denies to change environment.

For example, the following code properly works on original start,
but fails after a reload:

    perl 'sub {
        my $r = shift;

        $r->send_http_header(""text/plain"");

        return OK;
    }';

To fix this, PERL_SET_INTERP() added anywhere where PERL_SET_CONTEXT()
was previously used.

Note that PERL_SET_INTERP() doesn't seem to be documented anywhere.
Yet it is used in some other software, and also seems to be the only
solution possible."

Normally, the epoll module calls the read and write handlers depending
on whether EPOLLIN and EPOLLOUT are reported by epoll_wait().  No error
processing is done in the module, the handlers are expected to get an
error when doing I/O.

If an error event is reported without EPOLLIN and EPOLLOUT, the module
set both EPOLLIN and EPOLLOUT to ensure the error event is handled at
least in one active handler.

This works well unless the error is delivered along with only one of
EPOLLIN or EPOLLOUT, and the corresponding handler does not do any I/O.
For example, it happened when getting EPOLLERR|EPOLLOUT from
epoll_wait() upon receiving ""ICMP port unreachable"" while proxying UDP.
As the write handler had nothing to send it was not able to detect and
log an error, and did not switch to the next upstream.

The fix is to unconditionally set EPOLLIN and EPOLLOUT in case of an
error event.  In the aforementioned case, this causes the read handler
to be called which does recv() and detects an error.

In addition to the epoll module, analogous changes were made in
devpoll/eventport/poll."

This fixes a problem with aio threads and sendfile with aio_write switched
off, as observed with range requests after fc72784b1f52 (1.9.13).  Potential
problems with sendfile in threads were previously described in 9fd738b85fad,
and this seems to be one of them.

The problem occurred as file's thread_handler was set to NULL by event pipe
code after a sendfile thread task was scheduled.  As a result, no sendfile
completion code was executed, and the same buffer was additionally sent
using non-threaded sendfile.  Fix is to avoid modifying file's thread_handler
if aio_write is switched off.

Note that with ""aio_write on"" it is still possible that sendfile will use
thread_handler as set by event pipe.  This is believed to be safe though,
as handlers used are compatible."

Previously, when a buffer was processed by the sub filter, its final bytes
could be buffered by the filter even if they don't match any pattern.
This happened because the Boyer-Moore algorithm, employed by the sub filter
since b9447fc457b4 (1.9.4), matches the last characters of patterns prior to
checking other characters.  If the last character is out of scope, initial
bytes of a potential match are buffered until the last character is available.

Now, after receiving a flush or recycled buffer, the filter performs
additional checks to reduce the number of buffered bytes.  The potential match
is checked against the initial parts of all patterns.  Non-matching bytes are
not buffered.  This improves processing of a chunked response from upstream
by sending the entire chunks without buffering unless a partial match is found
at the end of a chunk."

When the stream is terminated the HEADERS frame can still wait in the output
queue.  This frame can't be removed and must be sent to the client anyway,
since HTTP/2 uses stateful compression for headers.  So in order to postpone
closing and freeing memory of such stream the special close stream handler
is set to the write event.  After the HEADERS frame is sent the write event
is called and the stream will be finally closed.

Some events like receiving a RST_STREAM can trigger the read handler of such
stream in closing state and cause unexpected processing that can result in
another attempt to finalize the request.  To prevent it the read handler is
now set to ngx_http_empty_handler.

Previously, the stream's window was kept zero in order to prevent a client
from sending the request body before it was requested (see 887cca40ba6a for
details).  Until such initial window was acknowledged all requests with
data were rejected (see 0aa07850922f for details).

That approach revealed a number of problems:

 1. Some clients (notably MS IE/Edge, Safari, iOS applications) show an error
    or even crash if a stream is rejected;

 2. This requires at least one RTT for every request with body before the
    client receives window update and able to send data.

To overcome these problems the new directive ""http2_body_preread_size"" is
introduced.  It sets the initial window and configures a special per stream
preread buffer that is used to save all incoming data before the body is
requested and processed.

If the directive's value is lower than the default initial window (65535),
as previously, all streams with data will be rejected until the new window
is acknowledged.  Otherwise, no special processing is used and all requests
with data are welcome right from the connection start.

The default value is chosen to be 64k, which is bigger than the default
initial window.  Setting it to zero is fully complaint to the previous
behavior."

Since 4fbef397c753 nginx rejects with the 400 error any attempts of
requesting different host over the same connection, if the relevant
virtual server requires verification of a client certificate.

While requesting hosts other than negotiated isn't something legal
in HTTP/1.x, the HTTP/2 specification explicitly permits such requests
for connection reuse and has introduced a special response code 421.

According to RFC 7540 Section 9.1.2 this code can be sent by a server
that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of
scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.  And the
client may retry the request over a different connection.

Now this code is used for requests that aren't authorized in current
connection.  After receiving the 421 response a client will be able
to open a new connection, provide the required certificate and retry
the request.

Unfortunately, not all clients currently are able to handle it well.
Notably Chrome just shows an error, while at least the latest version
of Firefox retries the request over a new connection."

OpenSSL 1.0.2+ allows configuring a curve list instead of a single curve
previously supported.  This allows use of different curves depending on
what client supports (as available via the elliptic_curves extension),
and also allows use of different curves in an ECDHE key exchange and
in the ECDSA certificate.

The special value ""auto"" was introduced (now the default for ssl_ecdh_curve),
which means ""use an internal list of curves as available in the OpenSSL
library used"".  For versions prior to OpenSSL 1.0.2 it maps to ""prime256v1""
as previously used.  The default in 1.0.2b+ prefers prime256v1 as well
(and X25519 in OpenSSL 1.1.0+).

As client vs. server preference of curves is controlled by the
same option as used for ciphers (SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE),
the ssl_prefer_server_ciphers directive now controls both."

When it's known that the kernel supports EPOLLRDHUP, there is no need in

to detect if EPOLLRDHUP is actually supported by the kernel because
epoll_ctl() silently ignores unknown flags.

With this knowledge it's now possible to drop the ""ready"" flag for partial
read.  Previously, the ""ready"" flag was kept until the recv() returned EOF
or error.  In particular, this change allows the lingering close heuristics
(which relies on the ""ready"" flag state) to actually work on Linux, and not

After the 92464ebace8e change, it has been discovered that not all

the response.

As a workaround, instead of RST_STREAM the maximum stream window update
will be sent, which will let client to send up to 2 GB of a request body
data before getting stuck on flow control.  All the received data will
be silently discarded.

If proxy_cache is enabled, and proxy_no_cache tests true, it was previously

Example configuration:

proxy_cache foo;

If a client sends If-None-Match, and the upstream server returns 200 with a
matching ETag, no body should be returned to the client. At the start of
ngx_http_upstream_send_response proxy_no_cache is not yet tested, thus cacheable
is still 1 and downstream_error is set.

However, by the time the downstream_error check is done in process_request,
proxy_no_cache has been tested and cacheable is set to 0. The client connection
is then closed, regardless of keepalive."

something like aio + sub filter (something that needs body in memory,

""task already active"" and ""second aio post"" alerts.

that is, on subrequest level.

This resulted in ""task #N already active"" alerts, in particular, when
running proxy_store.t with ""aio threads; sendfile on;"".

Fix is to tolerate duplicate calls, with an additional safety check
that the file is the same as previously used.

The same problem also affects ""aio on; sendfile on;"" on FreeBSD
(previously known as ""aio sendfile;""), where aio->preload_handler()
could be called multiple times due to similar reasons, resulting in
""second aio post"" alerts.  Fix is the same as well.

Previously, there were only three timeouts used globally for the whole HTTP/2
connection:

 1. Idle timeout for inactivity when there are no streams in processing
    (the ""http2_idle_timeout"" directive);

 2. Receive timeout for incomplete frames when there are no streams in
    processing (the ""http2_recv_timeout"" directive);

 3. Send timeout when there are frames waiting in the output queue
    (the ""send_timeout"" directive on a server level).

Reaching one of these timeouts leads to HTTP/2 connection close.

This left a number of scenarios when a connection can get stuck without any
processing and timeouts:

 1. A client has sent the headers block partially so nginx starts processing
    a new stream but cannot continue without the rest of HEADERS and/or
    CONTINUATION frames;

 2. When nginx waits for the request body;

 3. All streams are stuck on exhausted connection or stream windows.

The first idea that was rejected was to detect when the whole connection
gets stuck because of these situations and set the global receive timeout.
The disadvantage of such approach would be inconsistent behaviour in some
typical use cases.  For example, if a user never replies to the browser's
question about where to save the downloaded file, the stream will be
eventually closed by a timeout.  On the other hand, this will not happen
if there's some activity in other concurrent streams.

Now almost all the request timeouts work like in HTTP/1.x connections, so
the ""client_header_timeout"", ""client_body_timeout"", and ""send_timeout"" are
respected.  These timeouts close the request.

The global timeouts work as before.

Previously, the c->write->delayed flag was abused to avoid setting timeouts on
stream events.  Now, the ""active"" and ""ready"" flags are manipulated instead to
control the processing of individual streams."

This is required for implementing per request timeouts.

Previously, the temporary pool was used only during skipping of
headers and the request pool was used otherwise.  That required
switching of pools if the request was closed while parsing.

It wasn't a problem since the request could be closed only after
the validation of the fully parsed header.  With the per request
timeouts, the request can be closed at any moment, and switching
of pools in the middle of parsing header name or value becomes a
problem.

To overcome this, the temporary pool is now always created and
used.  Special checks are added to keep it when either the stream
is being processed or until header block is fully parsed."

When several requests were waiting for a response, then after getting
a CNAME response only the last request's context had the name updated.
Contexts of other requests had the wrong name.  This name was used by
ngx_resolve_name_done() to find the node to remove the request context
from.  When the name was wrong, the request could not be properly
cancelled, its context was freed but stayed linked to the node's waiting
list.  This happened e.g. when the first request was aborted or timed
out before the resolving completed.  When it completed, this triggered
a use-after-free memory access by calling ctx->handler of already freed
request context.  The bug manifests itself by
""could not cancel <name> resolving"" alerts in error_log.

When a request was responded with a CNAME, the request context kept
the pointer to the original node's rn->u.cname.  If the original node
expired before the resolving timed out or completed with an error,
this would trigger a use-after-free memory access via ctx->name in
ctx->handler().

The fix is to keep ctx->name unmodified.  The name from context
is no longer used by ngx_resolve_name_done().  Instead, we now keep
the pointer to resolver node to which this request is linked.
Keeping the original name intact also improves logging."

Since an output buffer can only be used for either reading or sending, small
amounts of data left from the previous operation (due to some limits) must be
sent before nginx will be able to read further into the buffer.  Using only
one output buffer can result in suboptimal behavior that manifests itself in
forming and sending too small chunks of data.  This is particularly painful
with SPDY (or HTTP/2) where each such chunk needs to be prefixed with some
header.

The default flow-control window in HTTP/2 is 64k minus one bytes.  With one
32k output buffer this results is one byte left after exhausting the window.
With two 32k buffers the data will be read into the second free buffer before
sending, thus the minimum output is increased to 32k + 1 bytes which is much
better."

requests will be reset, see https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/.  With
nginx, this may happen if the number of worker processes is reduced.

Two mechanisms are implemented to make it possible to store pointers
in shared memory on Windows, in particular on Windows Vista and later
versions with ASLR:

- The ngx_shm_remap() function added to allow remapping of a shared memory
  zone to the address originally used for it in the master process.  While
  important, it doesn't solve the problem by itself as in many cases it's
  not possible to use the address because of conflicts with other
  allocations.

- We now create mappings at the same address in all processes by starting
  mappings at predefined addresses normally unused by newborn processes.

These two mechanisms combined allow to use shared memory on Windows
almost without problems, including reloads.

Backed out 05a56ebb084a, as it turns out that kernel can return connections

assume anything about connections returned with deferred accept set.

To solve original problem the 05a56ebb084a tried to solve, i.e. to don't
wait longer than needed if a connection was accepted after deferred accept
timeout, this patch changes a timeout set with setsockopt(TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT)

improvements, and doesn't imply major changes to timeouts used.

Note that before 2.6.32 connections were dropped after a timeout.  Though
it is believed that 1s is still appropriate for kernels before 2.6.32,
as previously tcp_synack_retries controlled the actual timeout and 1s results

According to RFC 6066, client is not supposed to request a different server

There exist implementations however (e.g., SPDY) that rely on being able to
request different host names in one connection.  Given this, we only reject
requests with differing host names if verification of client certificates
is enabled in a corresponding server configuration.

On Mac OS X system toolchain by default prefers include files

various problems, in particular the one outlined below.

If the PCRE library is installed into /usr/local/, this results in pcre.h
being used from /usr/local/include (with PCRE_CONFIG_JIT defined), but
libpcre from /usr/lib (as shipped with the OS, without pcre_free_study()
symbol).  As a result build fails as we use pcre_free_study() function
if we try to compile with PCRE JIT support.

Obvious workaround is to the root cause is to ask compiler to prefer
library from /usr/local/lib via ./configure --with-ld-opt=""-L/usr/local/lib"".
On the other hand, in any case it would be good to check if the function
we are going to use is available, hence the change.

For edge case weights like { 5, 1, 1 } we now produce { a, a, b, a, c, a, a }
sequence instead of { c, b, a, a, a, a, a } produced previously.

Algorithm is as follows: on each peer selection we increase current_weight
of each eligible peer by its weight, select peer with greatest current_weight
and reduce its current_weight by total number of weight points distributed
among peers.

In case of { 5, 1, 1 } weights this gives the following sequence of
current_weight's:

     a  b  c
     0  0  0  (initial state)

     5  1  1  (a selected)
    -2  1  1

     3  2  2  (a selected)
    -4  2  2

     1  3  3  (b selected)
     1 -4  3

     6 -3  4  (a selected)
    -1 -3  4

     4 -2  5  (c selected)
     4 -2 -2

     9 -1 -1  (a selected)
     2 -1 -1

     7  0  0  (a selected)
     0  0  0

To preserve weight reduction in case of failures the effective_weight
variable was introduced, which usually matches peer's weight, but is
reduced temporarily on peer failures.

This change also fixes loop with backup servers and proxy_next_upstream
http_404 (ticket #47), and skipping alive upstreams in some cases if there
are multiple dead ones (ticket #64)."

Headers cleared with cache enabled (If-Modified-Since etc.) might be cleared
in unrelated servers/locations without proxy_cache enabled if proxy_cache was
used in some server/location.

Example config which triggered the problem:

    proxy_set_header X-Test ""test"";
    server { location /1 { proxy_cache name; proxy_pass ... } }
    server { location /2 { proxy_pass ... } }

Another one:

    server {
        proxy_cache name;
        location /1 { proxy_pass ... }
        location /2 { proxy_cache off; proxy_pass ... }
    }

In both cases If-Modified-Since header wasn't sent to backend in location /2.

Fix is to not modify conf->headers_source, but instead merge user-supplied
headers from conf->headers_source and default headers (either cache or not)
into separate headers_merged array."

Previously nginx used to mark backend again as live as soon as fail_timeout
passes (10s by default) since last failure.  On the other hand, detecting
dead backend takes up to 60s (proxy_connect_timeout) in typical situation
""backend is down and doesn't respond to any packets"".  This resulted in
suboptimal behaviour in the above situation (up to 23% of requests were
directed to dead backend with default settings).

More detailed description of the problem may be found here (in Russian):
http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-ru/2011-August/042172.html

Fix is to only allow one request after fail_timeout passes, and
mark backend as ""live"" only if this request succeeds.

Note that with new code backend will not be marked ""live"" unless ""check""
request is completed, and this may take a while in some specific workloads
(e.g. streaming).  This is believed to be acceptable."

Big POST (not fully preread) to a

    location / {

ngx_http_discard_request_body().  The same applies to all ""return"" used

Fix is to add ngx_http_discard_request_body() call to ngx_http_send_response()
function where it looks appropriate.  Discard body call from emtpy gif module
removed as it's now redundant.

This is expected to return 405 with empty body, but in 0.8.42+ will return
builtin 405 error page as well (though not counted in Content-Length, thus
breaking protocol).

Fix is to use status provided by rewrite script execution in case
it's less than NGX_HTTP_BAD_REQUEST even if r->error_status set.  This
check is in line with one in ngx_http_script_return_code().

Note that this patch also changes behaviour for ""return 302 ..."" and
""rewrite ... redirect"" used as error handler.  E.g.

    location / {
        error_page 405 /redirect;
        return 405;

    location /redirect {
        rewrite ^ http://example.com/;

consumption with long-lived requests sending many buffer chains.  Usual
example of problematic scenario is streaming though proxy with

message from a channel, the process tries to read the channel again.
The kernel (at least FreeBSD) may preempt the process and sends a SIGIO
signal to a master process. The master process sends a new terminate message,
the kernel switches again to the the child process, and the child process
reads the messages instead of an EAGAIN error. And this may repeat over
and over. Being that the child process can not exit the cycle and test
the termination flag set by the message handler.

The fix disallow the master process to send a new terminate message on
SIGIO signal reception. It may send the message only on SIGALARM signal."
