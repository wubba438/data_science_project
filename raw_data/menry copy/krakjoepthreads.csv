* Fixed infinite iteration on Threaded objects in PHP 7.3

This bug was caused by changes made in https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/d7f2dc4ec651628e10213625db6aee3559e214a9
There are probably better solutions for this, but this was the simplest and least invasive fix I could come up with.

* Fixed Threaded->chunk() odd behaviour on PHP 7.3

This issue is described in pmmp/pthreads#1. I think move_forward from a non existing index to an existing one is probably undefined behaviour anyway, so this PR prefers using reset, which is also backwards compatible with 7.2.

* fixes for persistent strings

use interned strings for globals
fixed one incorrect use of persistent string
work around possible bug in php-src in zend_hash_str_update_ptr() - keys inserted like this inherit persistence from their parent htable, which is not expected for the global function_table

* fix some socket tests on 7.3

* Make sure that keys are copied when iterating

Previously this would yield persistent strings from the props table. Inserting these strings into standard arrays would then cause issues later on.

* Fixed constant copying on 7.3

* Updates for PHP 7.3 branch

* cast zend_object_handlers*, duplicate test for php 7.3+

* keep pthreads objects consistent with php arrays"

In PHP 7.1+, these resulted in the signatures becoming `?typehint`, which raises warnings when upgrading old code which overrides these methods. As it turns out, these parameters are not supposed to accept null at all (see the arginfo).
These nullable flags are not necessary; it is sufficient to declare that only X parameters are needed.

This will break code written for pthreads 3.1.7dev which gave null explicitly to these methods; however the fact that these methods accept null is not documented anywhere and I think it is a bug.

Arrays were slow, and difficult to use correct because they behave surprisingly as a result of serialization.
An array is not a thread safe structure, there is no way to share them in many contexts sanely.
Instead, when an array is set as a member of a threaded object, it is coerced to a volatile object, this allows
us to:
	- avoid serialization of arrays (!!!!!!!!!!!)
	- avoid slowdown caused by manipulation of arrays by many threads
	- have arrays that are being manipulated in multiple contexts behave the same as a zend array
	- be delicious
Initial testing has taken place, Threaded ojects are now much more consistent with arrays in general, which is nice.
Enjoy ..."

Each time a resource created in another thread context is used, its address is added to PTHREADS_ZG(resources). Until then it was never removed and since PTHREADS_ZG(resources) is tested on every resource destruction attempt, collisions would occur after some time (when PTHREADS_ZG(resources) contains a few hundred addresses) preventing unrelated resources from being destroyed and causing memory access violations.

This fix removes resources from PTHREADS_ZG(resources) when their dtor is called.

Note that this fix uncovers another bug: PTHREADS_ZG(resources) is destroyed before EG(symbol_table) which prevent resources to be kept in ::run() 'local' variables when a worker is terminated."
