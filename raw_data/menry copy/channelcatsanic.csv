* Added support for HTTP Forwarded header and combined parsing of other proxy headers.

- Accessible via request.forwarded that tries parse_forwarded and then parse_xforwarded
- parse_forwarded uses the Forwarded header, if config.FORWARDED_SECRET is provided and a matching header field is found
- parse_xforwarded uses X-Real-IP and X-Forwarded-* much alike the existing implementation
- This commit does not change existing request properties that still use the old code and won't make use of Forwarded headers.

* Use req.forwarded in req properties server_name, server_port, scheme and remote_addr.

X-Scheme handling moved to parse_xforwarded.

* Cleanup and fix req.server_port; no longer reports socket port if any forwards headers are used.

* Update docstrings to incidate that forwarded header is used first.

* Remove testing function.

* Fix tests and linting.

- One test removed due to change of semantics - no socket port will be used if any forwarded headers are in effect.
- Other tests augmented with X-Forwarded-For, to allow the header being tested take effect (shouldn't affect old implementation).

* Try to workaround buggy tools complaining about incorrect ordering of imports.

* Cleanup forwarded processing, add comments. secret is now also returned.

* Added tests, fixed quoted string handling, cleanup.

* Further tests for full coverage.

* Try'n make linter happy.

* Add support for multiple Forwarded headers. Unify parse_forwarded parameters with parse_xforwarded.

* Implement multiple headers support for X-Forwarded-For.

- Previously only the first header was used, so this BUGFIX may affect functionality.

* Bugfix for request.server_name: strip port and other parts.

- request.server_name docs claim that it returns the hostname only (no port).
- config.SERVER_NAME may be full URL, so strip scheme, port and path
- HTTP Host and consequently forwarded Host may include port number, so
  strip that also for forwarded hosts (previously only done for HTTP Host).
- Possible performance benefit of limiting to one split.

* Fallback to app.url_for and let it handle SERVER_NAME if defined (until a proper solution is implemented).

* Revise previous commit. Only fallback for full URL SERVER_NAMEs; allows host to be defined and proxied information still being used.

* Heil lintnazi.

* Modify testcase not to use underscores in URLs. Use hyphens which the spec allows for.

* Forwarded and Host header parsing improved.

- request.forwarded lowercases hosts, separates host:port into their own fields and lowercases addresses
- forwarded.parse_host helper function added and used for parsing all host-style headers (IPv6 cannot be simply split("":"")).
- more tests fixed not to use underscores in hosts as those are no longer accepted and lead to the field being rejected

* Fixed typo in docstring.

* Added IPv6 address tests for Host header.

* Fix regex.

* Further tests and stricter forwarded handling.

* Fix merge commit

* Linter

* Linter

* Linter

* Add  to avoid re-using the  variable. Make a few raw strings non-raw.

* Remove unnecessary or

* Updated docs (work in progress).

* Enable REAL_IP_HEADER parsing irregardless of PROXIES_COUNT setting.

- Also cleanup and added comments

* New defaults for PROXIES_COUNT and REAL_IP_HEADER, updated tests.

* Remove support for PROXIES_COUNT=-1.

* Linter errors.

- This is getting ridiculous: cannot fit an URL on one line, linter requires
  splitting the string literal!

* Add support for by=_proxySecret, updated docs, updated tests.

* Forwarded headers' semantics tuning.

- Forwarded host is now preserved in original format
- request.host now returns a forwarded host if available, else the Host header
- Forwarded options are preserved in original order, and later keys override earlier ones
- Forwarded path is automatically URL-unquoted
- Forwarded 'by' and 'for' are omitted if their value is unknown
- Tests modified accordingly
- Cleanup and improved documentation

* Add ASGI test.

* Linter

* Linter #2"

* PEP 594 has cgi module scheduled for deprecation in Python 3.8. Reimplement
cgi.parse_header in Sanic. The new implementation is much faster than either
cgi.parse_header or equivalent werkzeug.parse_options_header, and unlike the
two, handles also quoted values with semicolons or \"" in them.

* Fix string escape.

* Useless linter complaints.

* More linter issues

* Add return type hint.

* Do not support quoted-pair escapes.

- Improved documentation and renamed the function more aptly as it only seems
  to apply to content-type and content-disposition headers.

* Unquote filenames also in normal mode.

* Add tests for headers. Adapted from CPython parse_header tests with changes on the final test.

* Linter

* Revert ""Unquote filenames also in normal mode.""

This reverts commit bf0d502bcd5c443a4178f1c239692976c0f5f185.

* Improved parse_content_header and added tests with Firefox and Chrome.

- Unescaping of quotes moved to parse_content_header because it affects all fields,
  not just filenames.
- It is impossible to handle all cases correctly but the current heuristics should
  suffice well for typical cases and beyond.
- Added comparisons with cgi.parse_header and werkzeug.parse_options_header.

* Updated comments as well."

If no X-Forwarded-Port nor Host headers are present, Sanic uses ""sockname""
to determine the port. This expected (host, port) tuple to be returned but
for IPv6 a 4-tuple is returned instead. Changed code so that port is picked
up in either case. Handling of ""peername"" was already correct in this regard.

_get_address and server_port both still return incorrect data or crash for
other socket types (e.g unix). Socket type should checked before any queries."

The current implementation of `sanic` attempts to make use of `ujson` if
it's available in the system and if not, it will default to the inbuilt
`json` module provided by python.

The current implementation of `ujson` does not provide a mechanism to
provide a custom `seperators` parameter as part of the `dumps` method
invocation and the default behavior of the module is to strip all the
spaces around seperators such as `:` and `,`. This leads to an
inconsistency in the response length when the response is generated
using the `ujson` and in built `json` module provided by python.

To maintain the consistency, this commit overrides the default behavior
of the `dumps` method provided by the `json` module to add a `seperators`
argument that will strip the white spaces around these character like
the default behavior of `ujson`

This addresses the issue referenced in #1398

* This commit adds handlers for the asyncio/uvloop protocol callbacks for pause_writing and resume_writing.
These are needed for the correct functioning of built-in tcp flow-control provided by uvloop and asyncio.
This is somewhat of a breaking change, because the `write` function in user streaming callbacks now must be `await`ed.
This is necessary because it is possible now that the http protocol may be paused, and any calls to write may need to wait on an async event to be called to become unpaused.

Updated examples and tests to reflect this change.

This change does not apply to websocket connections. A change to websocket connections may be required to match this change.

* Fix a couple of PEP8 errors caused by previous rebase.

* update docs

add await syntax to response.write in response-streaming docs.

* remove commented out code from a test file"

The Canceled exception handler purposely sets `response` to `None` to drop references to the handler coroutine, in an attempt to preemptively release resources.
This commit also fixes a possible reference-before-assignment of the `response` variable in the `handle_request` function.
Finally, another byproduct of this change is that ResponseMiddleware will no longer run if the `response` is `None`."

Allows for injection of the app object into the request object through
the request handler.

This allows for users to setup things like database connections etc. in
listeners and then utilize them throughout the their various route
handlers.

Usage is fairly simple like so:
```python
@app.get('/')
async def handler(request):
    request.app.anything
```

This is a tricky issue, but essentially uvloop is unavailable on windows. This means for windows users, we have to install Sanic with no requirements, and then manually specify all requirements apart from uvloop.

However, Sanic will work with standard asyncio event loop. So, I propose we remove the uvloop requirement on windows. This patch doesn't touch any demo imports."

This is by no means the final solution but it's a start in the right
direction. Eventually what needs to happen is we need to reduce the
complexity of the routing. CompsitionView can probably be removed later
on in favor of better Route objects. Also in the next version of sanic
we need to move merge_route and add_parameter out of the add_route logic
and just have them as standalone methods.

are made we can identify regression."

deprecation warning, but it also wasn't doing anything) fixes
multiprocessing tests so that they don't freeze pytest's runner.

Other notes:

Also moves around some imports so that they are better optimized as
well.

* Re-add in stop_event, maybe it wasn't so bad!

* Get rid of unused warnings import"

When Sanic has an exception in a request middleware, it fails to
save request object in `results`. In `sanic_endpoint_test`, because
it always requires `results` to have both `request` and `response` objects,
it prints traceback like attached example. It is not a user code and
it doesn't give any information to users, it is better to suppress
to print this kind of error.

To fix it, this patch insert collect hook as first request middleware
to guarantee to successfully run it always.

1. not list() -> callable()
The args of hooking parameters of Sanic have to be callables.
For wrong parameters, errors will be generated from:
```
    listeners += args
```

By checking just list type, the raised error will be associated
with `[args]` instead of `args`, which is not given by users.
With this patch, the raised error will be associated with `args`.
Then users can notice their argument was neither callable nor list
in the easier way.

2. Function -> Functions in document
Regarding the parameter as a list is harmless to the user code.
But unawareness of its type can be list can limit the potent of
the user code."
