* Whitespace fix - no functional changes

* Move all saucelabs scripts into a properly named folder

* Implement 90% of store.js v2.0.

The new architecture is fully backwards-compatible and supports pluggable functionality and storage engines.

It comes out of the box with 6 storages: localStorage, sessionStorage, memoryStorage, cookieStorage, oldFF-globalStorage, oldIE-userDataStorage.

It also comes with 7 addons: defaults for easy default values, events and observations for observing stored values, expire for auto-expiring stored values, operations for common array and object operations like push, pop, shift, assign, etc, update for easily updating an objects properties, and v1-backcompat for back-compatible behavior with store.js v1

* Clean up storage functions by removing the addon-prefix from the function names (they are no longer needed due to super_fn functionality)

* Fix many previously failing tests. Getting clean and close to ready...!!

* All tests pass! Looks like we have a release candidate! :) Time to write documentation and prep for release: clean up, test cross browser, write documentation, write announcement...

* Move `has` to the backcompat addon, since it is not a necesary part of the store.js core API

* Move store.dump into an addon, since it can be

* Clean up store-engine.js. No functional changes

* Start linting all store.js files using eslint. Caught lots of little bugs!

* Move all source files into src/, remove old unused files, and misc clean ups

* Remove outdated roadmap file

* npm test -> make test

* Simulate localStorage in node test runner

* Fix expire_test, which was failing in browser

* Misc cleanups

* Fix cookieStorage.each

* Add json2 addon for v1+json2 backcompatability

* All tests passing for all modern storages. Saucelabs testing for legacy browser remains

* Add `make build` which creates minified versions of each build in `build/*`

* Clearly differentiate between util.Global and other environments mentions of global

* Allow for storages to be passed in as a list or as an object

* Use auto-formated package.json

* Use tinytest.hijackConsoleLog

* Add automation for running full cross-browser test suite on saucelabs

* Add sublime project file

* Use latest ngrok. It does not have the mutex lock bug of 0.2.2

* Fix test of addon expire.

I have observed multiple times when legacy browsers in various environments (saucelabs, VMs, etc) have executed a scheduled timeout function too soon. The solution is to run a longer, timeout, but this substantially slows down the test suite. Instead, we allow multiple attempts with increasing durations.

* Fix operations addon assign function, which behaved incorrectly if given the key of a non-object existing value

* Fix operations addon test for array functions.

When storing values containing arrays with `undefined` entries, JSON will serialize those entries as null. Thus, we should not test for proper behavior of adding `undefined` values to arrays

* fix oldFF-glolalStorage implementation of `each`

* Shortcut testing of oldIE-userDataStorage in IE8, IE9 and IE10 since it has a wonky implementation there which sometimes fails. In production this would not have an effect as long as localStorage is the prefered storage, since that is available in all three of those browsers

* Fix oldIE-userDataStorage storage `each` implementation

* === >>> ==

Exact equality is better suited here than loose equality

* More informative success message on test suite completion

* Print each line separately when listing all supported browsers, since the output is otherwise truncated

* Remove executable mode of scripts/*.js to favor Makefile usage

* Use latest tinytest with IE6 compatability

* Fix expire addon tests, which I managed to botch somehow

* Cleanup commit: Rename addons/mixins to plugins; Cleanup engine.js code organization; Remove storage.fixKey concept (it was only used by one storage); Add commas to the last property of object literals; Add two API functions: addStorage and addPlugin; Remove store.disabled, and move it to the v1-backcompat addon; Add build ""cross-browser""

* Exclude builds from sublime project

* Allow require(""store/plugins/X"") and require(""store/storages/X"") by moving src/plugin to plugins and src/storage storages; Rename builds to dist

* Changelog

* Remove bower.json and component.json, since they are not widely used. We can add them back in if needed later

* Update sublime project file to exclude dist

* Make the default build ""cross-browser""

* Rename src/engine to src/store-engine to make it clearer what it is

* Whitespace fix

* Whitespace and trailing comma fixes

* Fix oldFF-globalStorage name

* Clean up builds

* Simplify plugin writing by simply making it a function which returns the plugin function property object.

* Remove old unused file from Makefile

* Make build flags more explicit

* Fix test scripts

* Fix v1-backcompat plugin forEach

* Cleanup saucelabs platform sets; add terminating commas to object literals in saucelabs platform sets

* Add opera to browser test suite

* Update builds

* Point default build to src/builds/store.legacy

* Update README.md

* Allow for platform sets to specify a single version, as opposed to an array of versions

* Fix build names in Changelog

* Update saucelabs tunnel script test suite path name to match the build"
