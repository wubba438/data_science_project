Removes the var decl check which often fires when the type is required
for documentation purposes. For example, when an enumerated list of
pre-defined values of a certain type is created, it may be desirable to
group those values under the type itself in the docs. If the type is
infered, godoc will not group them, but if the type is manually listed
they will be placed in the correct location.

Since this lint is not an important stylistic consideration and
frequently produces false positives, removing it is consistent with the
scope of lints in this project.

Fixes golang/lint#429

Now that tools' dependencies have been cleaned up in golang.org/cl/160837, lint
doesn't have any transitive dependencies on modules that import it using the
wrong path. It is now safe to reintroduce a go.mod file to this repo. I've
checked using dmitshur's instructions in
https://github.com/golang/lint/issues/436#issuecomment-469048301 that lint only
appears with its canonical module path in the build list.

go.mod file for now in order to resolve the issue. We will re-add

When returning multiple values with an error,
lint checks if the error is the last return value.
But the implementation actually is checking for all return values
except for the last one, and throw the alert if it found an error.

There is a (edge) case where some function returning more than one error
is getting a false positive even when the last return value is an error.

This patch adds an early check, to see if the last return value is an error
and if so, it will pass silently.

* Update .travis.yml for latest conventions, use fast_finish, test with -race.

This change follows #277, but updates .travis.yml to use latest
conventions as documented at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/go#Specifying-a-Go-version-to-use.
Specifically, use master instead of tip to refer to latest (unreleased)
version of Go.

Use .x to target latest patch releases of each point release of Go.

Use fast_finish to speed up build reporting with no semantic change.
It's documented at https://blog.travis-ci.com/2013-11-27-fast-finishing-builds/.

Use race detector when running tests.

* Update .travis.yml to migrate from legacy to container-based infrastructure.

If lint doesn't do anything that would require sudo access,
it's a good idea not to require sudo access. This allows the builds
to run on Travis' newer container-based infrastructure, which
are not considered legacy and should run faster.
See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/migrating-from-legacy/ for details."

Prior to this change, read errors and parse errors would cause vim quickfix to
open new buffers with meaningless paths. For logged output, vim would open a new
buffer with the timestamp as a name.

This change makes some assumptions that are true today:
 * Errors from ioutil.ReadFile are user-readable and meaningful alone.
    e.g. open example.go: no such file or directory
 * Errors from parsing concatenate with the filename to produce quickfix format.
    e.g. example.go:8:1: expected declaration, found '}'

With this change, the suggested autosave behavior from the README is usable.
