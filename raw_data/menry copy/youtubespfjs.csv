The previous change explicitly called `window.location.reload()` after assigning
to `window.location.href` to ensure a reload happens for URLs that contain a
hash.  However, an immediate call to `window.location.reload()` will cancel
navigation started by the assignment to `window.location.href` for other cases.

Instead, check whether the new URL will trigger a navigation first.  Adjust
the navigable-check function to account for hash URL to standard URL transitions
(e.g. `/page#target` to `/page`) and update the tests.

Preconnect requests are done by sending image requests to the target URL.
Before, this was done using `img` tags in an `iframe`, just like prefetching
JS/CSS uses `script` or `link` in an `iframe`.  However, this is unnecessary
overhead that can slow down sending the request.  Instead, use a simple `Image`
object to trigger the request.

Add support for setting the XHR `responseType` property to `""json""`.  This
defines the response data as JSON and prevents the browser from handling other
types of data.  It allows JSON parsing to be done off of the main thread,
reducing CPU contention that can happen with large responses and low-power
devices; this can yield smoother animations during navigation, for example.
However, it prevents processing chunked responses on-the-fly (i.e.
pseudo-streaming), effectively eliminating most of the benefits of multipart
responses.  Guard this behavior behind an ""advanced"" config flag and provide
no default to prevent accidental usage.  Setting `advanced-response-type-json`

The current approach to preventing early scrolling during navigation uses the
the current position during a history change event and scrolls to that position
after the event has been handled using `setTimeout`.  This leads to a brief
flash of incorrect position (aka jank) during history navigation because too
much time elapses between the browser's early scroll and the reset call.

Instead, during the history change event, save the current position.  During
the next scroll, if a position has been saved, scroll to it immediately (and
delete the saved position).  This executes the reset call in the same
synchronous operation as the browser's early scroll and eliminates the flash
of incorrect position.

Responses can now send a `name` value which will be used to construct ""from""

will be applied with the following patterns:

* `config['animation-class'] + '-from-' + _previous_name_`
* `config['animation-class'] + '-to-' + _current_name_`

This will allow transitions to be applied based on state of the page (i.e.
navigating from page A to page B) instead of based on the action (i.e.
navigating back in the history stack).

Currently, a `name` must be sent with each part of a multipart response for it
to be used when processing that part.  The last `name` value will be saved
for upcoming ""from"" classes.

In order to initialize a ""from"" class before the first SPF navigation, pages
can set the `data-spf-name` attribute on the `<body>` tag:

```html
<body data-spf-name=""home"" ...>
```

When handling a history change event, save the current position and scroll to
that (current) position immediately after handling the event to prevent the
browser from incorrectly scrolling too early.

The browser default behavior is to scroll to the position when `pushState` was
called just after firing a `popState` event.  This is okay only if using
`pushState` to move around a single page or if all content can be rendered
synchronously during the `popState` event handling.  Since navigation content
updates are asynchronous (either from cache or from network), avoid this early
scroll by immediately scrolling back to the current position after the event.
The proper position is then (re)set once the content is updated.

For now, guard this behavior behind the `experimental-scroll-position` config.

Previously CSS animation classes had to target both the history direction
(forward/back) as well as the animation point (start/end) via a combination
class, even if the properties were shared:
```
.spf-animate-forward-start .spf-animate-new,
.spf-animate-forward-end   .spf-animate-old,
.spf-animate-reverse-start .spf-animate-new,
.spf-animate-reverse-end   .spf-animate-old {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

Now, the classes will be split into discrete ones that represent a single
target only:
`.spf-animate-forward-start  ->  .spf-animate-forward.spf-animate-start`
`.spf-animate-reverse-end  ->  .spf-animate-reverse.spf-animate-end`

This allows less verbose CSS when doing animation that does not change based
on history direction.

files from a git tag, zip download, npm/Bower install, or a CDN.  Those wishing
to build from source should use the npm scripts as shortcuts.  (Anyone doing
active development will likely want to install Ninja globally to save some
typing.)

- test: run tests
- lint: lint files for style/formatting
- fix: automatically fix style/formatting of files
- start: run demo app
- clean: delete built files
- reset: delete built files and downloaded deps (get to newly-cloned state)

Promote previous `experimental-execute-unified` logic to be always enabled.

Inline script and style evaluation now always uses two functions:
- `eval`: conditionally evaluate the text only if changed
- `exec`: unconditionally execute the text

This matches the behavior of external script and style installation:
- `load`: conditionally install the resource only if changed
- `get`: unconditionally install the resource.

When processing a SPF response, the script and style execution rules are now:
* If an inline `<style>`, inline `<script>`, external `<link>`, or
  external `<script src>` with a `name` attribute is parsed, only execute
  if a style/script has not already been executed that matches the URL or
  text content.  Remove all other scripts and styles with the same name after
  executing.
* For all other scripts and styles (without a `name` attribute), execute
  unconditionally.

```

When navigating to a URL with a hash (aka fragment) that references a page
element, scroll the element into view before completing the navigation.  This
means that for a URL such as `/page#element-id`, the `scrollIntoView` function
is called on the referenced element just before the `spfdone` event is fired.

Split inline script and style evaluation into two functions:
- `eval`: conditionally evaluate the text only if changed
- `exec`: unconditionally execute the text

This matches the behavior of external script and style installation:
- `load`: conditionally install the resource only if changed
- `get`: unconditionally install the resource.

In addition, The inline script evaluation and external script loading functions
(`eval`, `exec`, `load`, `get`) now all remove `script` nodes afterwards,
unless in debug mode.  The inline style evaluation and external style loading
functions do not remove the `style` or `link` nodes.

For now, guard the new logic behind a `experimental-execute-unified` config.

First, SPF now sends an additional request header 'X-SPF-Previous-URL'. This contains the URL of the page which proceeds the loading page. It can be used to make decisions about what parts of the page to reload. It's usually the same as the referer, but differs when history events occur. In those cases the Previous-URL header represents the previously visible page, while the referer represents the original page that lead into the target.

Second, SPF now accepts a cache-suffix in the response. This is appended to the cache key to limit responses which should only be used in certain situations. This is then matched up against the lead in page's URL to determine if cache can be used.

I like the flexibility of the suffix in the response, but I'm not in love with the key generation mechanism, so I'm very open to suggestions here.

Whereas before a single caching pool was shared among all types of
requests, now there is differentiation between history navigation,
standard navigation and prefetching, and load requests are not
cached.

The new logic is as follows:

Writing to cache:
  - standard navigation writes to the history cache
  - history navigation writes to the history cache
  - prefetching writes to the prefetch cache

Reading from cache:
  - standard navigation reads from the prefetch cache and, if found,
    moves the entry to the history cache
  - history navigation reads from history cache
  - prefetching does not read from any cache

The previous logic is available if the ""cache-unified"" config flag is set.

processing support for multipart responses. Used together, an SPF
request can be processed in stages as it arrives, similar to standard
HTML rendering.

This CL introduces multipart responses and ensures that they can be used
interchangeably.  It also starts splitting navigation-related methods
into functional namespaces and unit tests.

The unchanged transfer format for a single (traditional) response is
an object serialized in JSON:
  '{ ""css"": ""..."", ""html"": {...}, ..., ""js"": ""..."" }'

The unchanged object for a single response after parsing this format is:
  {
    'css': '...',
    'html': { ... },
    ...,
    'js': '...',
    'timing': { ... }
  }

The new transfer format for a multipart response is an array of objects
serialized in JSON, where '[\r\n', ',\r\n', and ']\r\n' delimiters
are used to facilitate on-the-fly parsing:
  '[\r\n
   {""css"": ""...""},\r\n
   {""html"": {...}},\r\n
   ...,\r\n
   {""js"": ""...""}
   ]\r\n'

The new object for a multipart response after parsing this format is:
  {
    'type': 'multipart'
    'parts: [
      {'css': '...'},
      {'html': { ... }},
      ...
      {'js': '...'}
    ],
    'timing': { ... }
  }



The additional code to handle the multipart responses has increased the binary size:

Now, standard navigation in response to a click or JS navigate call will have the correct referrer sent.  This is done by sending the XHR for the next page before adding the new history entry.  However, back/forward navigation in response to browser history events will still be wrong because the browser changes the URL before the XHR is sent.  In both cases, an additional X-SPF-Referer header will be sent with the correct value.

Replace the ""navigate-started-callback"" and ""navigate-history-callback"" notifications with a single unified ""navigate-requested-callback"" notification that is published for either link clicks or history events.  Remove unused ""load-received-callback"" and ""load-processed-callback"" notifications, which are redundant with passed callback functions.

Also, minor fixes to the demo app to properly display the referer and to mark external scripts as loaded.
