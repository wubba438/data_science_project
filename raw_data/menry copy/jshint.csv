Previously, the identifier parsing logic returned early for a lone arrow
function parameter in order to avoid incorrectly extending the
environment record in which the associated arrow function was defined.
This unintentionally circumvented logic which enforced restrictions on
identifier names.

Refactor the parsing logic to enforce the restriction in all cases, but
only alter the environment record when the identifier is not a lone
arrow function parameter."

The function `checkLeftSideAssign` validates assignment targets and
includes a branch for targets which are applications of the spread/rest
operator. Although the symbol table includes an entry for the `...`
token, its definition as an ""infix"" operator is incomplete and cannot be
used to advance through an expression (e.g. the invalid code `0 ... 1`).
Instead, the operator is explicitly consumed in the productions where it
is allowed through the use of the internal `spreadrest` function. This
means the token is not used to build an expression. Therefore, the
branch in `checkLeftSideAssign` accommodates a condition that cannot
occur, and it may be removed without altering the behavior of JSHint."

A recent refactoring of the class parsing logic [1] removed the function
name inference logic (i.e. integration with the `nameStack` object) in

providing the method name to that routine, the change had an unintended
side effect: method names were used to create new entries in the new
environment record. This was observable from user code in the presence
of JSHint's `unused` linting option: when set, methods would incorrectly
shadow variables that shared the same name.

The second parameter of the `expression` function accepts a value that
modifies how the next token is parsed. When set to `true`, the token is
interpreted as the beginning of a statement; otherwise, it is
interpreted as the beginning of an expression.

Two call sites within the `for` statement's parsing logic specified the
string value `""for""`. Due to inconsistencies in how the parameter was
interpreted internally, this causes `expression` to mix parsing
strategies. Specifically:

- It used the ""statement"" parsing strategy to mark the token value as
  beginning a statement. This could be observed in the application of
  the `singleGroups` linting option. Further, it disqualify it for
  consideration as a Mozilla ""let expression""
- It used the ""expression"" parsing strategy to ignore the token's `fud`
  method

Since the grammar does not allow a statement in either location, the
""expression"" parsing strategy should be used consistently.

Achieve this by removing the argument from the call site, thereby
falling back to the default behavior of the `expression` function.
Update `expression` to consistently interpret the parameter for
""truthiness"" in order to discourage similar ambiguity in the future."

Existing code attempts to compile regular expression literals as a
mechanism to ensure validity. Update this code to ignore regular
expression flags in order to ensure consistent behavior when JSHint is

LetDeclarations and ConstDeclarations may not occur in positions
reserved for statements. This was previously implemented via a flag on
the ""funct"" object which would be referenced during the parsing of the
declarations. By signaling alterations to parsing behavior through a
global data structure (as opposed to more explicit and direct channels
such as function parameters), this pattern made the expected behavior
difficult to trace. It also needed to account for the complexity of
recursive parsing (e.g. by conditionally setting the flag to allow use
in ForStatement initializers and by un-setting the flag following the
parsing of the block's content). Finally, the pattern made it difficult
to apply the restriction to other declarations (function declarations
are currently incorrectly allowed in these positions).

Relocate the restriction, enforcing it instead from the parsing logic
for the BlockStatement and removing the complicated and indirect global
state."

The `phantom` and `phantomjs-prebuilt` modules cannot be installed in
legacy versions of Node.js because during their installation procedure,
they import code which uses ES2015 language features. When executed in
legacy versions of Node.js, this causes a syntax error, interrupting
installation and making it impossible to execute the project's tests.

A previous commit [1] addressed this issue by marking the dependencies
as ""optional."" This allowed the installation procedure to fail, and
because the packages are only necessary in the latest release of
Node.js, the relevant tests could execute as expected.

Unfortunately, this modification had an unintended effect on consumers
of JSHint: it forced them to also install the aforementioned packages.
Because these packages are only necessary when contributing to JSHint
(not when using it) and because they include large binary assets, this
had a non-trivial impact on the time and disk space required to install
JSHint.

Revert the previous change, marking the packages as ""dev dependencies""
once again. Ensure that the project's tests can continue to execute in
legacy versions of Node.js by introducing a script that removes the
offending packages prior to installation on those platforms.

Warning W014 was implemented to alert users of potentially-confusing
formatting resulting from reliance on ASI.

The original heuristic was applied for every expression and simply
referenced token values. It assumed that when the previous token was a
closing parenthesis or bracket, this always signified a line of code
where the newline could be interpreted as a statement boundary, e.g.

    x = 3 * (2 + 1)
    [0]

However, this heuristic was susceptible to false positives, where the
closing punctuator would not be interpreted as the end of a statement:

    if (true)
      [x] = []

Re-implement the code that detects the warning condition from the
general ""expression"" function to the specific ""infix"" parsing logic
(used only when the ""("" and ""["" tokens have been identified as
components of an exiting expression)."

There were two bugs in the original implementation of this error:

- violations from function expressions with empty bodies would not be
  detected
- violations from function declarations contained within strict mode
  code would be reported twice

Correct the first issue by ensuring that the ""(isStrict)"" property is
accurately set for functions with empty bodies. Correct the second issue
by re-locating the error detection logic to within the processing logic
for expressions and declarations and inserting an additional condition
within the latter.

(This correction does not require modification to the Test262 whitelist
file, although that test suite does offer coverage for this behavior. At
the revision in use by JSHint, the relevant tests are expressed using
`eval` and therefore unusable by parsers. Those tests have since been
reformatted to correct this; they will be incorporated when JSHint next
updates its reference to Test262.)"

Today, when a test expects an error to occur on a line that is
incorrect, the harness reports the situation in those terms. For
example, for the following test:

    exports.foo = function (test) {
      TestRun(test)
        .addError(9999, 1, ""Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression."")
        .test(""0;"");
      test.done();
    };

The test harness reports:

>     Errors with wrong location:
>       {Line 1, Char 1} Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression. - Not in line(s) {Line 9999, Char 1}

The requirement for tests to specify the character column for every
error is a recent addition to the test harness [1]. It was introduced
with only partial support in the test harness. That flaw did not impact
the harness's ability to identify test failures, but it did produce
confusing output in the event of failure.

When an error was reported with a character column that differed from
what was expected, the harness would simply report that the error was
defined but not thrown and omit details about the error that was
actually produced. For example, for the following test:

    exports.foo = function (test) {
      TestRun(test)
        .addError(1, 9999, ""Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression."")
        .test(""0;"");
      test.done();
    };

...the harness would report the following error:

>       Errors defined, but not thrown by JSHint:
>         {Line 1, Char 9999} Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.

This patch corrects the harness's behavior so it instead reports:

Validate JSHint's behavior for various invalid applications of the

syntax tests interacted and caused JSHint to report errors that differ
from those it would report when encountering each form in isolation.
Although JSHint makes a best-effort approach to recovering from invalid
syntax, this behavior is not formalized and should therefor not be
asserted by unit tests.

This factoring avoids the undesirable interaction, allowing the tests to
document JSHint's behavior under more predictable conditions. It also
highlights a previously-existing bug in the errors reported (as
documented via in-line code comments)."

A recent minor release of the npm module `request` has introduced

its own correctness in the effected environments.

effected dependencies as ""optional."" These dependencies are only
required by tests for the PhantomJS platform, and those tests can be
orchestrated from a single actively-maintained version of Node.js
without effecting coverage."

`export` declarations with empty export export clauses are not
necessarily superfluous: if they also specify a ""from"" clause, they will
cause the referenced module to be evaluated. Because of this, the
warning produced in these cases should be contextual--it should
recommend removal only if no ""from"" clause is present. In the presence
of such a clause, the warning should instead suggest use of a
binding-free `import` declaration (as this clearly communicates the
intention to evaluate a module without requesting any bindings).

Notes on compatibility:

- The previous warning behavior had not yet been published in a stable
  release (it was implemented at the same time as the parser was
  corrected to support `export` declarations without bindings). This
  makes this change in warning behavior backward-compatible with prior
  releases.
- This warning is relevant for `import` declarations as well. However,
  because prior releases of JSHint included correct parsing support for
  binding-free `import` declarations, introducing an equivalent warning
  would constitute a backwards-breaking change."

Previously, the left-hand side of the `for-in/of` head re-used the code
path for `var` declaration lists. This was undesirable for a number of
reasons:

- it made the `var` statement's parsing logic more complex
- it tended to produce inaccurate error messages, e.g. ""destructuring
  binding is available in ES6""
- it disallowed syntactically valid code, e.g. `for (a.b in {}) {}` or
  `for ([x[y]] of []) {}`

Refactor the parsing logic of `for-in/of` heads to more faithfully match
the actual language grammar. Update the expected errors in the project's
unit test suite according to the more accurate messages that this change
produces.  Simplify `var` statement parsing logic by removing the code
intended to support this condition. Maintain support for initializers
and the comma operator in order to improve error messages in the case of
common programming mistakes."

The internal `peek` function may be used to request tokens beyond the
end of the program. Because multiple call sites expect the function to
consistently return an object value, the ""end of program"" token is be
returned in these cases.

However, this situation may occur in cases where the ""end of program""
token is not the next token. The previous implementation of the function
would produce the `null` value in this event, violating callers'

Missing trailing commas in array and object literals can result in
undetectable visual ambiguities--the same visual ambiguities that lead
to bugs when a programmer relies on automatic semicolon insertion.
Therefore, it might be a good practice to always use them, so this
option provides warnings in their absence.

For example, this code might have worked last Tuesday:

    [
        b + c
    ].forEach(print);

But if one adds an element to the array and forgets to compensate for
the missing comma, no syntax error is thrown, and a linter cannot
determine if this was a mistake or an intentional function invocation:

    [
        b + c
        (d + e)
    ].forEach(print);

If one always appends a list item with a comma, this ambiguity cannot
occur:

    [
        b + c,
    ].forEach(print);

    [
        b + c,
        (d + e),
    ].forEach(print);

If this option is `true`, a warning will be thrown if a "","" does not
occur before the closing ""]"" or ""}"" in an array or object literal. If
option `es3` is also `true`, this option does nothing, because otherwise
the options would contradict each other, and the `es3` mandate is more
pressing.

There is no inverse of this option, that would warn if an ES5 programmer
omitted a trailing comma. Omission of a trailing comma in ES5 provides
no benefit, unlike option `trailingcomma`, which actually helps prevent
bugs. Such an inverse feature would be considered ""stylistic;"" do not
confuse `trailingcomma` as a ""style"" option, as it is no more
""stylistic"" than the default detection of semicolons is."

* [[CHORE]] Remove `lex.start` method

This method simply proxies `lex.nextLine` to scan a single line of the
program. It is currently only used to scan the very first line of input,
which is problematic for two reasons:

1. Linting options have not yet been applied via the `assume` function,
   so linting options that effect the parser's behavior are not honored
   for this first line (see the unit test corrected in this patch for an
   example)
2. So-called ""checks"" for asynchronously-reported warnings on the first
   line cannot be associated with a token. This makes it impossible to
   issue warnings asynchronously for the first line.

Because the `lex.token` method itself invokes `lex.nextLine`, these
problems may be avoided by removing `lex.start` and deferring the
invocation of `nextLine` until the first token is requested.

When JSHint encounters an ""open parenthesis"" token, it must determine if
the token marks the beginning of an arrow function or a grouping
operator before parsing can proceed.

To make this determination, it inspects the token stream to find the
corresponding ""close parenthesis"" character.

Previously, this lookahead behavior halted whenever a semicolon token
was encountered. This was presumably an optimization to allow the
algorithm to exit early in the event of an unmatched ""open parenthesis""
token.

Because a semicolon token may appear in the parameter list of an arrow
function (e.g. within a default parameter value that is a function
expression), the presence of such a token does *not* necessarily
indicate that the ""open parenthesis"" is unmatched.

Remove the condition concerning the semicolon character from the
lookahead algorithm."

The lexer returns `null` values when tokens are requested after all

attempted to look beyond the end of the program. In such cases, however,
it would also pollute the lookahead buffer with an invalid entry--the
`null` value returned by the lexer. Future calls to `peek` could receive
this buffered value.

Because JSHint's internals are written with the assumption that `peek`
always returns a token object, the `null` value would trigger a
TypeError and subsequent program crash.

Don't attempt to indent errors using data from other files, during

This change will fix the report of `col NaN` and the problem of `NaN` in
`error.character` while checking JS code extracted from non-JS files,
when more than one file has been passed in and their lengths don't
match.

The function `extractOffsets` finds the number of characters a JS block
must be shifted to show the correct character column for an error. The
result is an array consisting of numbers, for the block it checked and,
`undefined` for the lines it didn't have to look at.  `cli.run` executes
`extractOffsets` on each input file but wrongly tries to indent all the
errors found so far, across files, using the current file's offsets.
This commit makes sure `cli.run` only indents errors of a file against
the offsets fetched for the same file.

This commit also makes sure that we don't change or ruin the value of
`error.character` unnecessarily.

I have chosen to trust that `extractOffsets` will return an array with
only numbers (as a result of Array.length) and falsy values, to avoid
the unnecessary type conversion.

A test named `usingMultipleFiles` has been introduced to cli.

When an assignment expression has an invalid left-hand side, JSHint
previously issued error E013 (""Bad assignment.""), bailed out of
assignment interpretation and instead interpreted the left-hand side as
an ExpressionStatement.

In issuing E013, JSHint interprets the invalid JavaScript as an
assignment expression. Failing to parse the invalid target as the
left-hand side of the expression is inconsistent with this
interpretation. The inconsistency commonly triggers inappropriate (and
potentially confusing) errors such as ""Missing semicolon,"" and ""Expected
an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.""

Instead, JSHint should warn about the faulty assignment but continue
parsing as though the expression were a valid assignment target. Doing
so avoids emitting those errors that suggest that the left-hand side
were written as an ExpressionStatement.

1. Interpret faulty assignment targets as the left-hand side of
   assignment expressions in all cases, issuing error E013 and moving on
2. Remove inappropriate errors from affected unit tests (noting that the
   underlying ""Bad assignment."" error remains unchanged)"

In web browsers, enabling ES5 ""strict mode"" at a global level effects
all scripts executed in the same context. For this reason, the `strict`
option was originally implemented to enforce the directive's use in
function scope only.  However: the Browserify, Node.js, and PhantomJS
environments do not suffer from this problem.

Recent improvements to the option's behavior included making JSHint's
interpretation of `strict: true` to be contextual: in those environments
where a global `use strict` directive is ""safe,"" enabling the option
would require the global directive.

Although this change is an improvement (because it encourages more code
to be written in strict mode), it is backwards incompatible. Moreover,
the option's documentation in JSHint 2.8.0 explicitly described the
sub-optimal behavior:

> *Note:* This option enables strict mode for function scope only. It
> *prohibits* the global scoped strict mode because it might break
> third-party widgets on your page. If you really want to use global
> strict mode, see the *globalstrict* option.

For this reason, `strict: true` should continue to trigger the ""legacy""
behavior. The change brings that configuration completely in-line with
the recently-introduced `strict: func`, and because `strict: func` has
not been released in a stable version, it can safely be removed."

In the presence of the recently-introduced `esversion` option, JSHint
should reject any occurrence of the equivalent legacy options: `es3`,
`es5`, and `esnext`.

Previous implementation conflated the user-specified option values and
the state of the linter itself. Without a formal distinction between
these two concepts, it was not possible to consistently enforce this
constraint. For example, the value of `state.option.esversion` could be
set to `5` directly (i.e. `esversion: 5`) or indirectly (i.e. `es5:
true`), but only in the former case would a later in-line configuration
of `esversion: 6` be acceptable.

Achieve this by making an explicit distinction between user-specified
option values (in other words, the `es3`, `es5`, `esnext`, and
`esversion` properties of the `state.option` object) and the state of
the linter itself (the new `state.esVersion` property)."

In the absence of the `funcscope` option, JSHint validates
function-scoped variable references as though they were block scoped.
JSHint does not apply block-scoping semantics to reference counting,
however: re-declarations within nested blocks are *not* considered
distinct when determining whether a given binding is used.

Ensure that when a variable is re-declared within the same function
scope, usage tracking is ""shared"" across all identifiers.

This change required correcting two existing tests. Both alterations
removed warnings, meaning they do not reflect a backwards-incompatible
change in behavior.

1. In the following source code, the variable `ok` is used, so JSHint
   should not report otherwise:

        function(match) {
          var ch = this.string.charAt(this.pos);
          if (typeof match == ""string"") var ok = ch == match;
          else var ok = ch && (match.test ? match.test(ch) :
          if (ok) {++this.pos; return ch;}
        }

2. In the following source code, the `var` declaration for `d` is not
   technically used, but it is also invalid due to ES2015 block scoping
   semantics. Because JSHint continues to correctly emit an error for
   this code, the removal of the ""unused"" warning has little practical
   effect.

        function sup(a) {
          var b = 4;
          let c = 5;
          let d = 6;
          if (false) {
            var d = 7;
          }

Since the first public release of JSLint (ca120a7), this codebase has
automatically enabled the `newcap` option for all strict mode code:

    function use_strict() {
        if (nexttoken.value === 'use strict') {
            advance();
            advance(';');
            strict_mode = true;
            option.newcap = true;
            option.undef = true;
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

Commit 8de8247 unified the way JSHint detects and enforces strict mode
across contexts. Among other modifications, it included the following
change:

    - if (state.tokens.curr.value === ""use strict"") {
    + if (state.isStrict()) {
        if (!state.option[""(explicitNewcap)""]) {
          state.option.newcap = true;
        }
        state.option.undef = true;
      }

This change introduced a regression: it enables the `newcap` option for
class bodies and ES2015 module code as well.

Because ES5's strict mode and the warnings enabled by the `newcap`
option are orthogonal (and because as a stylistic concern, the `newcap`
is deprecated) correct the regression by relaxing the behavior for all
cases--do not automatically enable `newcap` when entering strict mode,
for whatever reason.

This change is backward-compatible because it will not cause JSHint to
produce new warnings. It corrects undocumented and surprising behavior,
so it should be considered a bug fix (despite the age of the bug in
question)."

Information about identifiers used are stored internally as properties
of objects whose key values are the identifier value. Because of
non-standard implementations of the `__proto__` property, input source
code that uses it as an identifier can have inconsistent side effects
across environments.

When using an object as a lookup table, the built-in
`Object.hasOwnProperty` is generally preferable for detecting property
membership. Unfortunately, due to the non-standard implementations
described above, this check has environment-specific results.

An alternate approach to membership detection is coercing direct
property references to a boolean value. This is not appropriate in cases
where the entries may themselves be ""falsey"" values, but in the
identifier lookup tables, entries are consistently object literals.

This second approach yields the same results across all legacy
environments and is also compatable with the standardized specification
for the `__proto__` attribute (provided the table is initialized to have
no prototype).

Since [the docs][1] mention it, and it's already supported via [config][2],
I thought I'd just pop the CLI support in.

This PR make `jshint` allow specifying the `--prereq` option on the command
line, accepting a comma-separated list of paths.

Test-related notes:

- Fixes the existing `testPrereq` test to check the right exit code. In its
  current incarnation, it could never fail (even when `lint` didn't pass)
- Added 2 tests for specifying the `--prereq` options from the command line.

Implementation notes:

I did the simplest thing possible (just merging the CLI `prereq` options in
with the config ones in the `run` method in `cli.js`). It's a little bit
awkward because there are 2 paths to `lint`:

1. `opts.useStdin`
2. `!opts.useStdin`

And each loads the config in a slightly different way. So the `mergeCLIPrereq`
function has to be in 2 code paths. So, slightly awkward, but not too terrible.

Fixes #1685.

- true / func - there must be a `""use strict"";` directive at function level
- global      - there must be a `""use strict"";` directive at global level
- implied     - JSHint checks the code as if there is the `""use strict"";`

Currently, JSHint's lexer continuously emits new ""end-of-file"" token
once all input has been consumed. This behavior makes the internal
`advance` function dangerous to use within iteration contexts. Such
usages need to explicitly check for the ""end-of-file"" token in order to
avoid entering non-terminating states.

Some of JSHint's parsing logic (such as that for template literal
parsing) takes this detail into account. Other areas (i.e. parsing class
bodies and function parameter lists) does not. While it would be
possible to extend each use with explicit safety checks, the possibility
for error in future feature additions would remain.

Update the lexer to consistently emit `null` after producing the
""end-of-file"" token, alleviating the requirement of explicit safety
checks in `advance`-calling code. Update existing unit tests with the
new parsing error information (which is more accurate in many cases)."

Define a general-purpose `isStrict` method that determines the language
mode according to these two distinct conditions.

Commit d75ef694385ba44ab49b2d2b2cf1f4bed0949ca7 oversimplified the
information passed to the `doFunction` method.

Prior to that commit, `doFunction` was invoked inconsistently (with a
token and with an object literal). This was incorrectly simplified to a
boolean value, which caused the helper function `isMethod` to stop
working:

    function isMethod() {
      return funct[""(statement)""] && funct[""(statement)""].type === ""class"" ||
             funct[""(context)""] && funct[""(context)""][""(verb)""] === ""class"";
    }

invocation of `doFunction`."

A recent change to JSHint included the ECMAScript 6 global identifiers
in JSHint's collection of ""predefined"" variables. This disallowed the
definition of those global values even in contexts that did not
implement them.

The intent of this change was to help users avoid bugs when migrating to
the new version of the language. Re-using an existing warning mechanism
caused confusion among many users [1][2][3] for two reasons:

1. The generated warning messages were somewhat misleading (i.e. the
   warning ""Redefinition of 'Promise'."" is inaccurate in ES5
   environments)
2. The method of disabling the warnings did not accurately communicate
   the intent of the developer (i.e. setting `predef: -Promise` does not
   prompt the user to consider the user to consider if creating their
   own global variable named `Promise` is appropriate)

A dedicated warning message more clearly describes the best practice
that motivates this particular constraint on global variable names. An
explicit option makes it less likely that users will disable this
warning without understanding the motivation.

Intoduce a new option, `futurehostile`, and dedicated warning message to
better communicate the intent of restricting usage of future-reserved
identifiers.

The `_.has` utility method checks for the existence of the provided
properties as ""own"" values of the given object. The removed code
erroneously uses it to check attributes of an Array. The first branch is
(incorrectly) token when statements begin with identifiers/literals ""0"",
""1"", or ""length"", and the nested branch depends on the block type which
is never a destructuring assignment in this case.

This code has been unreachable since its original introduction into the
codebase [1]. Removing it has no effect on the behavior of JSHint.

unreachable so it is safe to remove.

Prior to this commit, JSHint parsed ""fat arrow"" function parameters as
though they were expressions in a list. This had unintended side-effects
relating to:

1. the scope of the declared variables. This problem was only partially
   addressed through manual modification of the data structure for
   global variables.
2. the syntax accepted within the arguments list. Most significantly,
   ""default parameters"" expressions were misinterpreted.

By re-using the `doFunction` function, the same logic can be used when
parsing parameters of both ""traditional"" functions and ""fat arrow
functions"".

This change requires supplying additional context to `doFunction`
because the parser may have already consumed certain tokens depending on
the form of the expression.

Identifier tokens now provide a `raw_text` property which access the actual text of the identifier
used in source code. This allows the same error messages to be reported as previously.

This patch modifies the 'forin' check so that it correctly recognizes
negative conditional checks using continue. For example:

for (var key in collection) {
    if (! collection.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        continue;
    }
    doSomething();
}

The conditional itself is not analyzed beyond checking whether it
starts with a negation operator or not. Results of the if analysis
are stored in a stack that is evaluated after the for loop was parsed
completely. As a result, the improved check also works for nested loops.

These changes are intended to prevent jshint from choking on template literals when
esnext mode is enabled. It has been written to support a sub-lexing process to allow
for further linting in the future. At this time it does not support escaped string
characters with backslashes, due to my limited knowledge of the template literal
syntax.

I am hopeful that this will pave the way for doing more useful linting with this
construct, and to allow jshint to be used in applications which make use of this
language feature.

I added a new meta-property to the block-scoped stack of
variables called (shadowed). When addlabel adds a new
function level variable it checks whether there's already
a block-scoped variable with the same name in the current
scope and if there is, it sets the (shadowed) property of
that variable to true. getlabel function respects that
property and doesn't return variables with (shadowed) == true.

At the end of doFunction we go over a list of all variables
defined in this function and un-shadow their block-scoped
friends if needed.

A bit hacky but I don't have any better idea right now
that doesn't involve big refactoring that merges blockscope
and funct trees together."

Currently JSHint reports an error when it encounters an option in a
/*jslint */ comment which is not either a jshint option or a renamed
jslint option.  This has the unfortunate side-effect that source files
which specify valid options to JSLint which aren't recognized by JSHint
produce errors in JSHint (e.g. the ""continue"" option or the new
""closure"" option).

We could fix this by whitelisting all valid JSLint options, but this
would require updates to JSHint every time JSLint added an option and I
doubt JSHint really wants to waste resources validating options to
JSLint (since, presumably, people using the /*jslint */ syntax would run
JSLint, which would warn them anyway).

Instead, ignore unrecognized options in /*jslint */ option comments.

This patch adds `gather(opts)` to the cli export with the intention of
allowing third parties to hook into the file resolution, including file
ignore, logic.

`cli.gather` is only concerned with the following opts:
- cli args (files to linted)
- ignores (as would be parse from .jshintignores)
- extensions (as would be supplied by --extra-ext cli flag)

It would return an array of file paths that should be linted."

In addition to removing the erroneous flags:

- Consolidates all the esnext & moz tests into a single `isMozOrNext()` function that returns true if either flag is set.
- Allows an esnext flag to override a moz flag when both are present (the former will be a standard)
- Disallows ""feature"" overlap where such feature does not have the the same syntactic form across moz and esnext (eg. array comprehension syntax)

This patch updates the logic that looks for a .jshintrc file to
use to search relative to the file being linted rather than the
current working directory. If no file is found, config still
falls back to ~/.jshintrc.

This behavior should better reflect user intent when linting
files, regardless of where jshint (or the editor leveraging
it for checks) is run from. Since config lookup is now per-file
instead of per-run, the internal findFile method has been
memoized to avoid redundant searching.

This allows users to control what level of check to do for unused variables.  The options are:
* false: No checking is done
* true: ""vars"" + last function param only
* ""vars"": Variables and functions are checked, but not function params
* ""strict"": ""vars"" + function params

Example:

    function foo(a, b) {
		return b;
	}

If 'unused' === true, no warnings will be thrown, since 'b' is used.

If 'unused' === 'strict', then a warning will be thrown, since 'a' is not used.

This commit makes JSHint properly recognize FutureReservedWords both
for ES3 and ES5 environments. From now on, unless option es5 is set,
JSHint will warn about all FutureReservedWord identifiers per
ECMA-262 (Ed. 3). However, it won't warn about such identifiers in
a property context:

	var throws = 1; // Warning
	a.throws = 1;   // No warning

For ES5 it now recognizes strict-mode specific FutureReservedWords:

	//jshint es5:true

	var let = 1; // No warning

	(function () {
		""use strict"";
		var let = 1; // Warning
	}());

I also made the parser a bit more tolerant towards FutureReservedWords
in statement labels. So the code below will trigger warning but
still be parsed completely (before it would exit with false positives):

	volatile: for (var i = 0; i < 10; i ++) { break volatile; }

In JavaScript, 'catch' blocks should have their own scope--just like
functions--but we used to treat them as an ordinary blocks meaning
that their scope was combined with the outer function (or global).

This patch changes that by treating catch blocks as anon functions
with a special property '(catch)' that is 'true' only for catch
blocks. This allows us to detect undefined variables better than
before (see GH-247).

In IE, however, variables from the catch scope can leak into the
outer scope. We catch one such example (GH-618):

  var e = 2;

  try {
    throw 'boom';
  } catch (e) {
    // JSHint now warns that 'e' might get overwritten in IE.

This patch adds a new option, unused, that makes JSHint warn whenever
it encounters a variable or a function that was defined but never
used:

    function add(a, b) {
        var c = 5;
        var d = 10;

        return a + c;
    }

    // Line 1: 'b' is defined but never used.
    // Line 3: 'd' is defined but never used.

Implementation details:

JSHint marks unused variables with type `unused` and unused functions
with type `unction` (don't ask why `unction`, I don't know). However
this generated scope tree doesn't provide any additional information
aside from variable name and its type. So I added a new special field,
'(tokens)' that contains a dictionary of tokens of all variables and
functions declared within this scope. This way once I have an unused
variable I can pretty easily look up its token just by the name.

Function params were, for whatever reason, marked as type 'parameter'
that wasn't actually used anywhere else. I changed it to 'unused' so
that JSHint could catch params that are never used.

There is also a special key: a variable named 'undefined'. JSHint
assumes that such variables are part of the popular defensive pattern
and doesn't consider such variables as unused. Otherwise I'd had to
treat 'undefined' as a variable everywhere and that's too much work.

Tests:

There is a unit test that tests most obvious combinations. In addition
to that I enabled this option for our jQuery 1.7 regression test and
checked all newly generated warnings manually.

As a convenience to users, it would be nice if `jshint-rhino.js` were directly runnable rather than requiring the user to invoke rhino and pass the script as an argument for every use of JSHint.  To that end, these commits add a shebang line and mark `jshint-rhino.js` executable during build.

Add a shebang to jshint-rhino.js to tell the shell how to execute the
file and mark it executable after build.

Note1:  Ignore the return code of chmod in case the user is on a
filesystem which does not support setting execute permission.
Note2:  Make use  of /usr/bin/env to catch rhino anywhere in the PATH.

Also reformat the rhino build target slightly to match the other targets
(replace chained '&&' with separate shell commands).  Combine multiple
invocations of cat into one.

Fixes GH-394. We queue ""x is not defined"" warnings because sometimes
variables are defined after they are used (this is valid in JavaScript).
But if they were not defined at all, we apply the queued warning. This
was breaking JSHint when there were too many errors: our code was
outside of the try/catch block but still called quit() that throws
an exception.

This commit fixes that by moving the code into the body of try/catch."

This commit closes GH-49 and GH-146. It adds a new option multistr
to allow code like this:

```
var x = ""hello\
world"";
```

It disallows any spaces between backslash and the new line so

```
var x = ""hello\

world"";
```

is still disallowed. It also catches this buggy code:

```
var x = ""hello
world"";
