* make_spec.lua: rename children to child

Naming a variable ""children"" when it holds one child is confusing, and blocks
naming actual children.

* make_spec.lua: fix migration of children nodes in create_anchors

Prior to this commit, when migrating the children of a node to a new one,
children are moved as they are iterated via `cmark_node_next`; however, when a
child is moved under the new node, its next relationship with its sibling is
broken, so in fact at most one child is migrated, and the rest are lost. This
resulted in cases like

This restores intuitive parsings for a number of changes.

The main change is to disallow strong or emph when one of
the delimiters is ""internal"" and the sum of the lengths of
the enclosing delimiter runs is a multiple of 3.

Thus,

    **foo*bar***

gets parsed `<strong>foo*bar</strong>` rather than
`<em><em>foo</em>bar</em>**` as before."

    markdown

One advantage of this is that `spec.txt` becomes a valid
Markdown file.

`tests/spec_test.py` has been changed to use the new format.

The old `tools/makespec.py` has been replaced by a lua
program, `tools/make_spec.lua`, which uses the `lcmark` rock
(and indirectly libcmark).  It can generate
html, latex, and commonmark versions of the spec.
Pandoc is no longer needed for the latex/PDF version.
And, since the new program uses the cmark API and operates
directly on the parse tree, we avoid certain bad results we
got with the regex replacements done by the python script."

Text like

Existing implementations diverge quite a bit on this
case, with several interpretations:

1. paragraph, heading, paragraph
2. paragraph, break, paragraph
3. paragraph containing literal `---`
4. heading, paragraph

Interpretation 4 seems most natural, and it opens up an expressive
possibility otherwise closed off -- multiline headings.

Authors who want interpretation 2 can use a form that can't be
interpreted as a setext heading line, e.g.

    Foo
    bar
    * * *
    baz

or insert blank space around the thematic break.

Authors who want interpretation 3 can use backslash escapes.

Background: I was implementing the new tab logic and was surprised that
all the spec tests passed even though I hadn't changed the continuation
logic of indented code blocks to skip columns. The added example checks
this."

Thanks for pointing this out.

We might want to revisit the decision to allow a list to
interrupt a paragraph.  It's a minority opinion:
http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/?normalize=1&text=Text+text%0A-+one%0A-+two%0A

And, in fact, in our initial discussions I was pretty strongly
opposed to it.  Others felt strongly that people would naturally
create lists this way, and that it should be allowed. Some of
this is sumarized here:
http://talk.commonmark.org/t/requiring-a-blank-line-between-a-paragraph-and-list/657

This is a first step towards keeping the code for each kind of

a block start, and metadata that determines how line data
should be handled.

This improves parsing of emphasis around punctuation.

Background:
http://talk.commonmark.org/t/emphasis-inside-strong-broken-in-js-implementation-when-parenthesis-involved/903/6

The basic idea of the change is that if the delimiter is part of
a delimiter clump that has punctuation to the left and a normal
character (non-space, non-punctuation) to the right, it can only
be an opener.  If it has punctuation to the right and a normal
character (non-space, non-punctuation) to the left, it can only be a closer.

This handles cases like

    **Gomphocarpus (*Gomphocarpus physocarpus*, syn. *Asclepias
    physocarpa*)**

and

    **foo ""*bar*"" foo**

better than before.

The spec section on Emphasis and Strong Emphasis has been extensively
revised.  The C and JS implementations have been brought up to date,
and all tests pass."

All the links the spec were broken. I changed `http://jgm.github.io/CommonMark/spec.html` to `http://spec.commonmark.org/0.13/`. It'd be nice if there was a `http://spec.commonmark.org/latest/` so you don't need to change the README every time a new version (unless there's major changes so the URL fragments aren't valid anymore.

The spec itself has some broken fragment links, e.g. `#image` instead of `#images`. Unfortunately I don't have a good tool that checks fragments so I don't have the full list."
