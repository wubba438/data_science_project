This is a temporary fix for an issue where the metadata of the
currently playing item isn't updated when the player is stopped.
This change just makes sure that, if the player isn't ""prepared""
(buffering, playing, or paused), it will send `playFromMediaId()`
rather than `play()` when selecting an item.

This change works around a peculiarity in the ExoPlayer media session
extension and how metadata is propagated.

By including a download status, MediaMetadataCompat will create an
""extras"" bundle, which will then be included when retreiving
its MediaDescriptionCompat (with `.getDescription()`)

This in turn allows the placing of *all* of the metadata from
the MediaMetadataCompat into the MediaDescriptionCompat that
`.getDescription()` returns, which is then passed along to the
media session as one would expect.

This should fix the issue of album art not appearing on the
lockscreen: GitHub issue
[#227](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-UniversalMusicPlayer/issues/227).

The two changes to each file are unrelated. For CardPresenter, this is
the first part of a change for the Now Playing badges. The
CardViewHolder now shows the badge animation depending on the status of
the music. For QueueManager, this is a small update so that when a
random queue starts playing, the metadata update occurs, just as if a
chosen queue started playing.

Updated: Move some helper methods to QueueHelper and MediaIdHelper.
Delegate media item/queue item view setup to MediaItemViewHolder,
including all state-related checks.

Updated: Separate tv view code into new CardViewHolder class.

The issue was that a fragment was being restored by the framework on
orientation changes. Such a fragment would show nothing since its onStart()
returns if the mediabrowser is not connected. This was compounded by the
fact that onConnected() in the activity was adding a new fragment on each call.

This fix does the following:
1. Moves the code that should be run when a MediaBrowser is connected into
a method named onConnected()
2. Changes the Activity to start with a fragment if savedInstanceState is null.
3. Changes the connectionCallback of the activity to call the fragment.onConnected()
4. Finally it handles the case where a new fragment is added when the browser is already
connected => onStart() called onConnected()
