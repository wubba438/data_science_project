Nuget packages updated to use ItemGroup None instead of Copy target

Remove AnyCpu <When/> option from props files and consolidate with x86 and Win32. Set Private to false and rely on the

Ideally would move the OffScreen, WinForms and WPF targets file content to the props (as they're actually props now), unfortunately
we need guaranteed ordering and Nuget 2.8.x doesn't provide that, if we leave them as .targets it'll happen late enough to make sure

* JSB Rewrite - Add CefSharp.RegisterBoundObject javascript method

To get around the problem of IPC timing, I've reversed the communication, now it's the render process requesting
the bound objects, the implementation is incomplete at this stage, more just a basic proof of concept

Rewrite BindingTest.html using QUnit
One of the tests doesn't map correctly as it requires def user interaction

TODO:

- Get objects by name
- Rename Messages.h values that relate to this change so they are more descriptive
- Better error handling
- Caching of objects within a render process
- Investigate global context options, don't think it's possible to call an async method directly in the global context

# Conflicts:
#	CefSharp.Example/Resources/BindingTest.html

* JSB Improve Request/Response message names

* BindingTest.html - Output stress test results

* Remove JavascriptRootObject was leftover from time we used WCF to transmit objects

* JavascriptObjectRepository - Objects are now sent in the same list with an IsAsync flag

Separation when sending over IPC with two unique lists isn't necessary

* JavascriptObjectRepository - Return objects by name or return all by default

Untabify CefAppUnmanagedWrapper.cpp
Add minor comment to CefBrowserWrapper for a reminder that we use Frame Identifier as dictionary key

* Add //TODO: JSB comments for work that's left to be done

Ideally within a render process we cache bound objects once they've been communicated,
It would also be nice to make multiple binding requests so objects can later be added dynamically

* JSB Allow multiple calls to CefSharp.RegisterBoundObject

Update BindingTest.html to name two distinct calls to different bound objects

* JSB - Add some notes about caching, no working implementation yet

* JSB - Dynamically Register object on Request

* JSB Add ability to unbind an object and rename RegisterBoundObject to BindObjectAsync

# Conflicts:
#	CefSharp.Example/Resources/BindingTest.html

* JSB BindObjectAsync - if objects already bound then return false

* JSB - Ignore Indexer properties

Were previously throwing an exception

* JSB - Add LegacyJavascriptBindingEnabled option so preserve existing behaviour

This is only useful for SPA application and those that only navigate to pages
hosting within a single domain. Any sort of cross-site navigation and a new
render process will be spawned and objects won't be bound automatically
(You can use the new methods to request they're bound yourself, at least in theory,
more testing required on this)

* Add LegacyBindingTest.html

Current disabled by default. To enable uncomment CefSharpSettings.LegacyJavascriptBindingEnabled = true;
in CefExample.cs

* RegisterJsObject and RegisterAsyncJsObject can now only be used when CefSharpSettings.LegacyJavascriptBindingEnabled = true

This little change allows users to set the RenderOptions BitmapScalingMode for the ChromiumWebBrowser Wpf control just like this:

<cefSharp:ChromiumWebBrowser RenderOptions.BitmapScalingMode=""Fant"">

While NearestNeighbor (fixed value before my edit) looks fine if each rendered pixel is exactly displayed as a single pixel, using that setting for a browser placed in a viewport leads to ugly results.

You can test the different BitmapScalingMode settings for example in the Wpf.Example application if you set the RenderOptions.BitmapScalingMode property for the ChromiumWebBrowser in BrowserTabView.xaml.
Just change the Angel (Tweak WPF Rendering) of the browser in the running application to actually see the differences.

The problem seems to be that OnContextCreated is never called as the page has no javascript code on it.
Keep the same callbackRegistry logic for kJavascriptCallbackRequest as without a context there cannot be a callback
For kEvaluateJavascriptRequest we now manually create a callback registry for the frame if required. Once the script is executed OnContextCreated is called, the wrapper creation is ignored and the context should be released as per normal in OnContextReleased"

The code previously in CefAppUnmanagedWrapper.cpp's OnProcessMessageReceived method did not check for a nullptr callbackWrapper resulting in an exception.
Also note that previously the success and reponse variables were not initialized by default which I believe to have been a mistake after following all of the if..else code paths (most importantly some error conditions would never be returned back).
I added a new test to BindingTest.html entitled ""Test Disposed Callback"" which makes the same 1.5 second delayed callback that ""Test Callback"" does, but then immediately navigate the page to www.google.com.  Without the fix in CefAppUnmanagedWrapper.cpp the browser's renderer process will die in about 10 seconds."

* Only indicate movement when there is actual x/y movement and we're not going from Maximized to non-Maximized since this logic ends up being handled elsewhere.
* Add some debugging logic so that other folks can experiment with this scary looking change.
* Cave after realizing that every ChromiumWebBrowser needs to be notified of any kind of movement. (and not JUST the visible tabs from WinForm.Examples)

Added a handler assignment on the first call to CefSharp::Initialize
which will ensure CEF is shutdown properly should the calling program
not manually call the shutdown method before the process exits.

This bug only seems to affect Windows XP, however I have tested on both
Windows XP and Windows 7 and with this change neither have any ghost
processes left over after the program calling CefSharp exits.

The immediate purpose here is to make it easier to add local JS object
binding. Rather than have each WebView implement the interface on its own,
we can simply have the BrowserCore implement it, and expose that. That
also allows us to keep parts of the interface ""internal"", which wouldn't
be possible if it was all exposed through IWebBrowser. If we like this
change, we might get rid of some of the IWebBrowser methods that are just
wrappers, and instead rely on shared code in BrowserCore."
