Here's what changes from a dev point of view:

* The makefile is now the One True Entrypoint for build stuff. There are no more npm scripts.
* `make test` now runs all the tests, even the browser ones.
* The browser tests now work on Windows.
* `make lint` lints all languages. `make py_lint` and `make js_lint` lint 1 each.
* `make py_test` and `make js_test` test 1 language each.
* `make` takes care of making a venv for you (in the top level of the checkout) whenever it needs one. If you have an existing one activated before you make, it'll use yours instead.
* New Python dependencies are automatically installed at the next `make` whenever they're added to requirements files or setup.py. Note that you'll see occasional spurious package installation attempts after you change branches, because the branch change causes the mod dates of files to be reset to the current time. But the attempts are reasonably quick and idempotent.
* `npm install` is run automatically whenever package.json has been updated.
* `make doc` from the top level now builds the docs.
* A failing doc build will now fail the CI tests, so we don't get surprised on master anymore.
* As a bonus, pip installing fathom-web now works on Windows."

```

I believe this is because 'require' is relative to the directory in which the script is found, while eslint is checking relative to the current working directory.

This could be resolved by:
* Ignoring the error (easiest)
* Updating 'eslint-plugin-node' to >= v5.1.0 in which we can apply the 'resolvePaths' setting.
  * This requires also updating 'eslint', as otherwise 'make lint' fails
  * Updating 'eslint' updates default rules, for which there are then dozens of new violations throughout the source code to address
  * I vote that considering updating eslint be a follow-up issue, rather than part of fixing #122

In light of these options, I chose the best, easiest one, since it doesn't blow up everything else."

Travis now runs a local HTTP server[1] in a background process, and the functional test opens a locally hosted test page.

I also moved all functional test files to a new directory: test/functional

Finally, since test scripts are never going to be imported as ES6 modules, I made the test a .js file rather than a .jsm. Note: if I were to leave it as a .jsm, I would have wanted to change the 'require' statements to 'import' statements to keep consistent with the other .mjs files. These .mjs files get transpiled via Babel into CommonJS .js files (i.e. using 'require' statements) as a build step.

[1]: I did quite a lot of deliberation about whether an HTTP server would be sufficient (compared to an HTTPS server) and determined it was. Ultimately, I adhered to one of the principles of extreme programming (thanks Daniel): don't add functionality until it's necessary. Here is my reasoning (I spoke with a Mozilla security engineer who works on certificates):
* TravisCI's default environment runs each build on a [single machine](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/trusty/#using-trusty)
* This means we are running the server on the loopback interface, and there shouldn't be much risk -- particularly since we don't have any secrets.
* The only downside is there are some [DOM APIs that only work in secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts/features_restricted_to_secure_contexts) -- none of which we are using currently. But Firefox is working on enabling these APIs in this case where everything is on the same machine."

Unfortunately, the previous commit's approach based on clickability proved untenable.[1]

A distant second sync solution is to early return where possible and use the cheapest styles first (the second implementation approach[2]), which reduces Fathom jank by 13%*, though there are a couple differences:
* No 'getBoxQuads'. This is an experimental API only enabled on Nightly.
* Checks if the element is off-screen. The Price Tracker implementation was missing this check.

Unfortunately, this implementation still uses 'ancestors', which causes expensive XRays[3] work in extension applications and still triggers layout flushes at suboptimal times. This is something that can be avoided with an async solution to the tune of a 40% reduction in jank using 'requestAnimationFrame' and 'setTimeout'[4].

On the brighter side, it is more correct than the previous implementation, removing 'getComputedStyle().width' and 'getComputedStyle().height' completely and covering more valid cases than before.

*: This is slightly worse than the expected 16%, because my original implementation in Price Tracker did not check for elements off-screen as the Fathom implementation does. Its profile[5] shows:
 - The largest unresponsive chunk is still caused by Fathom extraction, contributing 399 ms of jank right around page load.
 - `isVisible` made up 238 ms (60%) of this jank.
 - This change reduced overall Fathom-related jank by 61 ms (13%) compared to the original implementation of isVisible[2].

Compared to a baseline profile[1] of Price Tracker's current 'isVisible' implementation (on which Fathom's 'isVisible' method is based), this clickability approach offers a 53% (146 ms) reduction in Fathom-related jank[2] for the same locally hosted sample page.

This is largely due to removing the use of the 'ancestors' Fathom method in 'isVisible'[3], which was performing a lot of redundant layout accesses (and triggering a lot of layout flushes) for the same elements. Also, at least in an extension application, DOM accesses (e.g. repeatedly getting the next 'parentNode' in 'ancestors') are very expensive due to X-Rays[4].

Notes:
* If the proposal to the W3C CSS Working Group (see inline comment in patch) is implemented, this clickability approach could forgo the workaround and see as much as 81% (374 ms) reduction in Fathom-related jank[3].
* This implementation can still benefit from memoization, as the same element (e.g. 'div') could be considered for multiple different 'type's[6].

All you have to mess with is the learning rate to get a pretty good result: no more manually tuning the decay as well. And LR=1 generally does a pretty great job off the bat. I've changed the defaults to reflect this, upping the iteration count as well so a naive user will get a reasonable production value. I'd still run it to 15000 iterations for the final value--why not?

Here are the raw test results that led me to this decision:

Pop-up overlay ruleset:
* Converges (at default 1.e-3 LR) without any fiddling but not as fast as any of my manually tuned SGD runs. How about if we just run it for 15,000 iterations? It beats SGD run to 300 iterations. 6min vs. 16s (plus lots of human fiddling time).
* Crank the LR to 1 and it hits the floor immediately. The best SGD solution I found doesn't match it until i=1700. The SGD then beats it ever so slightly. However, Adam validation performance is significantly better than SGD.
* LR=.1 does pretty much the same as LR=1, just with less oscillation at the beginning and leveling off to a slightly worse value.

Price-wise price ruleset:
* Levels off at 51 with LR=1, i=1800. The optimal SGD result is obscured in the mists of time but looks like about 55. So, Adam does well.
* Dropping the LR down by a factor of 10, to 0.1, still converges by iteration 1800.
* Adam just seems much less sensitive to choices of LR, which is nice.

Remove unused imports as well."

...as measured on tuning readability:

    Got to 14.74 4x faster.
    Got to 11.97 in 7 vs. 27 minutes (3.8x faster).
    Got to 11.85 in 8 vs. 69 minutes (8.6x faster).

We do this by adding caching of solution costs (hit rate ≈ 90% for the sort of single-coefficient-at-a-time nudging we've often used, 3% for the coeff-swapping approach of the bin-packing problem). We also make sure to report the best-encountered solution rather than merely the one that's current when time runs out.

At the moment, the caching leaks memory since entries never expire, but the leakage is bounded by the max iterations of the annealer and is insignificant in practice. It is an open question why cache hit rate for readability is near zero: comparable single-coeff-nudgers yield a higher rate, and we wouldn't expect such a speedup for a low one. Stochasticity could be a factor.

Also allow the annealer hyperparameters to be modified through constructor params. I haven't yet found any that are both faster and better, but various useful balances are achievable, like [10643.296506954695, 113.30886882813805, 0.023803813406736214, 4.231731642265747], which finds solutions about half as good but finds them 32x faster."

Close #58.

Now rules report only which types they finalize, and LHSs report only possible type combinations and which types are mentioned, and the unified Rule.prerequisites() implementation takes care of the rest. This greatly reduces the complexity of compound LHSs like and(), and the new Rule.prerequisites() is much easier to follow as well. It also results in an optimal query plan for `and(type('A')) -> type('A')`.

A future optimization opportunity would be to figure out prereqs at compile time, once.

* Upgrade chai to 4.x, which allegedly makes deepEqual work on Maps and Sets. I'm not so sure.
* Rule.prerequisites() now returns a set. Changed some ruleset tests accordingly.

The fact that it's a function is not unique: notes() and score() take functions as well. props() is more descriptive than func(): it suggests the return value, which is what other callback-taking calls also are named after.

Considered names:

* func()  # abbreviation :-( but a well known one
* facts()  # inaccurate: returns a single fact
* fact()  # doesn't necessarily return a whole fact; can layer with rightward calls
* all()  # want to reserve this for quantifiers
* everything()  # Makes it clear that it overrides any previous calls, no matter their kind. Might suggest a reach outside this rule
* hash()  # not a very JS term
* custom()  # is it more custom than a note() or score() callback?
* obj()  # too generic, abbrev
* properties()  # long
* props()  # abbrevation :-( but a well-known one. I like that it focuses your attention on the individual properties returned and on the per-subfact layering with other chained calls.

This removes the user's need to care about Fathom's laziness, as far as I can recall right now.

As a bonus, this allows us to avoid eager-computing the entire ruleset when a ruleset is asked about a specific DOM node: now it can just happily return fnodes which compute on demand.

Factor out the non-eager bits into dedicated ""soFar"" routines on Fnode so tests that test our laziness could still call them and so, in one place, the executor wouldn't get into an infinite recursion.

Remove the TODO about enumerating the types on a fnode. We won't provide a way to enumerate them—at least not without a compelling demonstration that it's useful—as that would require running an entire ruleset to exhaustion. Making callers ask about types individually using hasType() lets us remain lazy. Making hasType() eager-compute the asked-about type makes this pattern usable for situations where you're interested in whether the page as a whole is classified as various types."

I'd actually prefer ""top"" for the LHS, but ""max"" is already in place in code and minds, and it's 90% as good.

My initial impression is this makes it easier to reason about the code. Block scope certainly decreases the amount of state you have to think about at any one time. There's no sense requiring functions or classes to be defined in specific orders, though; this isn't C, and they're still hoisted in ES6.

And my favorite: we no longer need to do a bunch of declaration bookkeeping at the front of each function just to accurately reflect the language semantics. It's less work and terser. Accurate reflection of the semantics is ensured by no-use-before-define."

This makes it much easier to debug, rather than messing about with source maps and the dearth of tooling that supports them. We can restore Babel later if we want to run within Firefox.
