This is how it used to work pre-4.0.9, where the bound handlers for
resizing and positioning the dropdown were bound at the first time
that the dropdown was opened. This was changed for the 4.0.9 release
as a part of 3f75227a693 where it was not clear why this late binding
was happening, so it was removed to simplify the code.

The late binding is necessary because the handlers within results for
generating the results, and thus the content within the dropdown,
are bound after the handlers for the dropdown are bound. This results
in situations where the handlers for positioning the dropdown are
bound before the dropdown is updated with content, resulting in the
positioning being calculated for the old content and thus being
incorrectly placed. By binding the positioning handlers after the
dropdow is opened for the first time, we can ensure that the
positioning handlers are bound after the result handlers, so we
won't have to worry about this issue.

The handlers are only bound once because they only need to perform
all the calculations a single time. There is no need to keep checking
all of the calculated styles more than we need to, so this is guarded
by a flag which ensures it is only bound a single time per dropdown.

* Made the test suite for translations more complete

There were previously tests for translations within the test suite,
but they only covered a select few problem cases that had previously
been fixed. They did not cover the majority of cases, which makes
changes to how the translation mechanism for Select2 works a bit
more challenging.

So this adds tests for the majority of edge cases around translations,
including how one would expect the fallback chains to work and also
around how defaults interact with the language options. This should
not be considered an exhaustive list of all of the edge cases, but
it should be good enough to refactor the internals and not have to
worry as much.

The one change of note to this test file is that we are now properly
resetting the defaults in between tests. This should fix any issues
that we may have seen where the defaults were not being reset, and
thus tests were not properly isolated and would start to interfere
with each other. This required pulling the module definition down
below the imports, since we need to reference the defaults within
the module definition.

Many of these tests will fail because the translation system is
broken in many small, unrealized ways. The next few commits should
make these pass and fix the issues that we are seeing.

* Consistently resolve the language option

This fixes an issue that we have had for a while where we did not
have a way to consistently take the `language` option from a string,
array, object, or whatever else is specified and resolve it into
`Translation`-compatible objects or strings. Now there is a new
internal `_resolveLanguage` function which is able to take any of
the supported ways of specifying a language and resolve it down into
the supported language chain.

This now means that we can properly resolve the following cases,
and we can do it in a consistent manner.

* When the language is specified as just a string (for example: ""en"")
* When the language is specified as a string containing a region
  (for example: ""en-US"")
* When the langugae chian is specified as a list of strings (for
  example: [""es"", ""en""])
* When the language is specifid as an object containing messages
  (for example, when a user overrides only a subset of messages)
* When the language is specified as a list of strings and objects
  (for example, when a user wants to use a language other than
  English and also wants to ovverride some default messages)
* When the language is not specified at all (the most common case)
* When the language is specified as an empty object (an edge case
  that allows us to skip processing it)

This allows us to consistently produce the language fallback chain
based on the given `language` option, something which we could not
actually do before because we didn't have a consistent chain. This also
means that now the `language` option will consistently be an array
after going through this process, instead of being any number of
types before.

The translation generation currently does not support having objects
and strings mixed as a part of the fallback chain, despite that being
how the default chain has always worked, and as such there are still
failing tests around this.

* Move English to always be at the end of the language chain

This was technically true in most cases in the past, because if a
language chain was manually specified then it would have English
injected into the end of it anyway. This is needed because not all
translations are complete, but we know the English one is, and
Select2 relies on the translation that it uses being complete.

This will result in cases where a user specifies a language but still
receives English translation for some things, which is what users
have historically seen when using partial translations anyway. This
just ensures that there will always be a complete translation that
is being used, so they won't get unexpected errors and will instead
get unexpected English translations.

* Filter out repeated languages in fallback chain

This is mostly being done for performance reasons, since Select2
will not behave any differently when there are duplicates, but it
makes things cleaner when you ask for the fallback chain and it
only contains unique values.

This cannot distinguish between languages specified by name (string)
and languages specified by the contents of their language file
(such as the default, English), but this should generally not be
an issue.

* Convert the language chain into a finalized translation

This extracts the logic for converting parts of the language chain
into the finalized `Translation` objects out into its own method,
with some small fixes for edge cases.

This can now properly convert a language chain containing both
strings and objects into a translation object that contains them
both.

We no longer need to special case the `language` option being an
array since we know that it will be an array once the language
resolution process is completed.

* Switch default translation to be empty

This should have no external effects, but it fixes an interesting
bug where resetting the defaults would not always reset custom
translations. This was because it was possible to modify the
included English translation when you were setting a default for the
language option.

This should not cause any issues because the English translation is
now appended to the end of the language chain when the defaults
are applied, which means that English will continue to exist as the
final fallback.

* Inherited `lang` attribute should be below the default in the chain

It was pointed out in #5468 that the `lang` attribute, when inherited
from a parent element, was above the option set in the global default
within the inheritance chain. While this makes sense because of how
we inherit other properties, it does not make sense for the `lang`
attribute.

The inheritance chain for the `language` option has been adjusted
to be the following:

1. The `lang` attribute on the original `<select>` element
2. The `data-language` attribute on the original `<select>` element
   (because of how `data-*` attribute resolution affects options)
3. The `language` option specified when initiailizing Select2
4. The `language` Select2 default
5. The `lang` attribute on a parent of the `<select>` element

While this is a breaking change, we believe that this change will
have minimal to no impact on real-world usage of Select2, because
of how the `lang` attribute is generally used within documents.
We believe this will now make setting the default language through
JavaScript easier and more reliable, bringing it in line with how
we recommend it is done within the documentation.

This was implemented through a new method `Defaults.applyFromElement`
instead of within the old `Options.fromElement` method because it
relies on the global defaults object. While we could have reached
in to the internals in order to apply it appropriately, it made
more sense to handle the proper resolution through a single
consistent place.

This was not implemented in the `Defaults.apply` method because that
method is not typically passed in a reference to the original
`<select>` element that it is applying the options for.

Closes #5468

* Properly resolve language chains with dictionaries

It is possible for a language chain to be specified that includes
both a dictionary and the string translation as a part of the same
chain, but we would previously throw an error because we assumed
that the list could only contain strings and that dictionaries
would never be included in lists.

This fixes the issue so language region normalization only occurs
when a string is specified in the language chain, which is what we
were previously assuming was the case but was not actually.

This also now resolves the entire language option during the
`Defaults.apply` method. This should be a no-op except for internal
tests, because the `Defaults.applyFromElement` method should almost
always be called in real-world scenarios."

* allowClear no longer shifts selections to a new line

This fixes an issue that we have had with the ""x"" icon used by the
`allowClear` option where selections that just barely interacted
with the position of the ""x"" icon would be pushed to a new line
that was separate from the normal second line of selections. This
case was pretty rare, because you only had a ~9px area where the
interaction could occur.

The issue was cuased by the ""x"" icon being sized for the height of
the text in the selection choices, which should be the same as how
the selection choices themselves are sized. Unfortunately this did
not take into account the fact that the selection choices are given
a 1px border which increases their size by 2px, which is what lead
to the odd behaviour. This behaviour could not be replicated without
the 1px border because the height would then line up correctly.

The issue can be fixed by adding a 2px margin to the bottom of the
""x"" icon, which would force overlapping selections on to the correct
second line of selections. This was the method that many users have
been using to correct this issue, but was not the method we chose to
use. A 1px padding has been added to the ""x"" icon instead, which
should expand the touch area of the ""x"" by a little while also
increasing the height of the ""x"" by enough to prevent the overlapping.

Fixes #4470

* Remove hard-coded height in tests

Because tests are executed on different browsers, and because each
browser sets their own line height, we cannot depend on the height
of the default Select2 being consistent across browsers. As a result,
we must write our tests to calcualte the expected height based on
known data. In the case of this test, we can calculate ahead of time
what two rows of selections is supposed to look like, instead of the
edge case that we can otherwise encounter."

* Move search accessibility tests under selection tests

This is a reduced version of a5ab08b49cb which is split out to only
set the `aria-activedescendent` and `aria-owns` attributes on the
search box located within the selection container. This is the search
box used within a multiple select, and previously it did not always
set these two attributes correctly.

One major change here is that we clear the `aria-activedescendent`
attribute if the result that is selected does not have an ID. This
was not being done previously, instead the attribute was still
containing the old value, and it meant that sometimes the wrong
result was being pointed to.

The test coverage for this was also expanded to ensure that these
attributes are properly being set.

* Set aria-activedescendent and aria-owns on dropdown search

This is a reduced version of a5ab08b49cb which is split out to only
set the `aria-activedescendent` and `aria-owns` attributes on the
search box located within the dropdown. This is the search box used
within a single select, and previously it did not set these two
attributes at all. Additionally, it did not set the `aria-autocomplete`
attribute, which is also needed for screen readers to properly read
through the list of results.

There was previously no test coverage for this, so the tests were
largely copied from the tests for selection search.

* Set proper ARIA roles on result elements

When Select2 4.0.0 was originally written, accessibility was tested
using the Orca screen reader and Mozilla Firefox as the browser.
Because a `<select>` box could contain `<optgroup>` elements, which
can further contain additional `<option>` elements, Orca would read
out a `<select>` box as a tree view. Apparently Orca was the only
screen reader to do this, but Select2 maintained this behaviour
because the ARIA spec did not allow grouping elements for the right
roles.

In the ARIA 1.2 spec, an element with the role of `listbox` (which
is the proper one for representing a `<select>` element) can now
contain elements with the role of `group` that can be used for
grouping. This means that now Select2 can switch to use the proper
ARIA roles to better match how most browsers represent the `<select>`
element out of the box.

As a result, instead of the Select2 results list being represented
as a tree containing tree items, it is now represented as a listbox
containing options and groups. Notices will be represented as an
alert, which more closely represents what they were being used for.

This is a reduced version of a5ab08b49cb which is split out to only
fix the `role` attributes on elements within the results list.

* Switch search boxes to have a role of searchbox

I'm pretty sure this is implicit now, but since we used to specify
that the search box had a role of `textbox`, we may as well migrate
that over to specify the role of `searchbox`. This is different
from the original pull request where this role was changes to
`combobox`, but that is because we are working against the ARIA 1.2
spec and the original pull request was working agianst the ARIA 1.0
spec, which required the search box to have that role.

* Set aria-controls instead of aria-owns on search boxes

In ARIA 1.1, there was a switch to use `aria-controls` on the search
box to point to the results list instead of using `aria-owns`. This
is required because the `combobox`, in our case the selection
container, should have the `aria-owns` attribute pointing to the
results list. And because only one elment can own another element,
we must fall back to `aria-controls` to represent that relationship.

The tests have also been adjusted to reflect this new discovery."

This fixes a bug with the search box where, when it had a placeholder,
it would expand the width of the selection container because it was
too large. This bug was specifically caused by the search box not
factoring in the padding surrounding it when caclualting the width
it needed to be, which resulted in the search box extending
outside of the selection container. This bug was easy to notice if
your Select2 was set to have 100% width and if the container it was
held within was not a block element.

This fixes the bug by switching to using `width()` for calculating
the search width instead of using `innerWidth()`, which ignored the
surrounding padding.

* Reposition dropdown whenever items are selected

This fixes an old bug where if you had a multiple select with the
`closeOnSelect` option set to `false` and many options being
selected, the dropdown would not reposition itself if the selected
options expanded the container down another line. This was because
the dropdown was only being repositioned when it was opened, closed,
or if something around it was scrolled or resized. Unfortunately,
in most cases none of these happened and the dropdown would start
covering the selections.

This was fixed by telling Select2 to resize the dropdown when new
options are selected or existing options are unselected.

The positioning handlers have been attached at the time that the

don't rely on anything involving the dropdown being open. This
removes the flag and process for setting these handlers only after
the dropdown was opened for the first time, and moves these handlers
to always be set at bind time."

This fixes a bug that was introduced in Select2 4.0.0 and only
partially fixed in Select2 4.0.6-rc.0 where the `title` attribute
that is set on the selection container (or individual selections,
for a multiple select) is not cleared when the text/title of the
option is not set. In most cases, users no longer see this issue
because the `text` property of most data objects is set, so the
`title` attribute will always be cleared correctly. There was a bug
for cases where the `text` property was not set, or where the `text`
property was set to an empty string, that resulted in the `title`
attribute persisting with the incorrect value.

We have fixed this issue by always removing the `title` attribute
from the selection (or not adding it in the first place, for a
multiple select) when the `text` and `title` properties of the data
object are empty or not present.

This also adds in a series of tests to ensure the `title` attribute
is set properly in a variety of cases, building upon the ones that
already existed.

This fixes a bug where if you cloned a Select2, the internal ID used

properly clear all of the internal data and all of the internal

attribute being used for the internal mapping.

Now we properly clear the `data-select2-id` attribute from the element

In order to enable the ability to uniquely identify a result by an ID
in the DOM, we generate a new ID for the result based on a combination
of things, including the container ID prefix that is generated and
used elsewhere in Select2. This has worked fairly well for use cases
including attaching Select2 to an existing `<select>` and loading in
options from a remote data set.

Unfortunately, because this process relied on the container ID being
used as a prefix, this failed for options which were automatically
generated on initialization using the `data:` option to Select2.
These were not being generated with an ID because at the time that
they were being generated, the data adapter was not aware of the
container it was being used in. This broke some accessibility features
because we had a mix of options in the results list with IDs, and
some without, so we fixed the ordering to make this work.

Option generation no longer happens when the data adapter is first
initialized, which is where it was previously happening, and instead
it now occurs when the data adapter is bound to the container. This
allows us to ensure that the data adapter is always aware of the
container it is being associated with, so now it will be able to
generate the result IDs.

This also fixes the tests for the array adapter as well as the
legacy `<input />` adapter so they properly bind to a container
during the test. This was causing test failures becuase the options
which would previously be generated during initialization were no
longer appearing.

This fixes that issue by listening to the `select` event which is
triggered whenever an option is selected, and triggers the ""maximum
selected"" message based on that event. This should now force the
message to be displayed, even when the results did not have to be
queried another time.

This behaviour, where the focus was happening on a small asynchronous
delay, was added in commit 933189b92 late last year in a commit with
no supporting tickets or commit message explaining what the change
was trying to accomplish. This commit has effectly been reverted within
this commit, since it caused a regression in how focus was being
assigned that made it inconsistent with a standard `<select>`.

A test was added for this which ensures that we won't see that
regression again.

Ever since the 4.0.0 release of Select2, there has been a bug where
if you enabled infinite scrolling but did not return enough results
on the first load of AJAX to show a scrollbar, then infinite
scrolling would not be enabled and you could not view anything other
than the first page of results. The solution for this was first
proposed in #3888 but it was closed off because of inactivity and
missing tests.

This fixes the issue by performing the check to see if more results
should be loaded both on scroll and also when the results are first
loaded. This solves the issue that we were seeing before, because
the plugin knows it needs to load in more results, just it did not
receive the scroll event before and thus was not able to actually
load in the new results.

This has the potential to trigger multiple AJAX requests to load in
multiple pages of results if the user has the ability to see many
options, but only a few are being loaded at a time.

This also adds tests for infinite scrolling, both to ensure that
it will attempt to load additional pages, even without the scrollbar,
and to ensure that the regular behaviour of not loading additional
pages when the scrollbar is visible is preserved.

Fixes #3088"

This check is in place in most other places, mostly because we have
run into widespread issues under similar circumstances and we like to
avoid those, but it was forgotten here. There also were no tests
covering this, so it was never caught.

This adds tests that ensure that the option in the results list will
be generated with the correct ""disabled"" state based on whether or
not it, or a parent element, is marked as disabled.

This should have been easy: just check `element.disabled`

Unfortunately the `disabled` property is not inherited within the
option chain, so if an `<optgroup>` is disabled, the `<option>`
elements or other `<optgroup>` elements held within it do not have
their `disabled` property set to `true`. As a result, we needed to
use the `matches` method to check if the `:disabled` state is
present for the element. The `matches` method is part of the official
standard, but it was not implemented under that name for a while and
as a result Internet Explorer only supports it under the prefixed
`msMatchesSelector` method and older versions of Webkit have it
implemented as `webkitMatchesSelector`. But once we use this method,
it appears to consistently return the expected results.

This `matches` method and prefixed predecessors are not supported in
IE 8, but they are supported in IE 9 and any browsers newer than
that. Instead of buulding a very hacky solution using
`querySelectorAll` that was brittle, I have chosen to act like
everyone else and pretend IE 8 no longer exists.

This allows for more accurate resolution of the width when compared

Removing this no longer breaks a unit test, and having it in here

clear what problem this was solving, since it was manually applied
from a series of pull requests.

It claims to be fixing an issue that was specific to IE11, and I'm
willing to re-introduce that bug because there doesn't appear to be
a regression test for it, and it's breaking some critical use cases.

The goal should be to focus the search box if it would have normally
lost focus when the selection was updated.

* Update tests to be compatible with jQuery 3.0.0

There was a change in jQuery 3 that ensures that the return value of `.val()` on a multiple select is always an array. This is a breaking change from previous versions, where `null` or `undefined` were returned in these scenarios. Because we cannot `assert.equal` on a list of possible values, these assertions were switched to `assert.ok` which should be good enough.

* Properly strip out units in positioning tests

Before we were assuming that there were no units, and only were we stripping them out if we were expecting 3 digits. Now we just strip out all non-digit characters, so that should do the job and get us what we want.

There was a change in jQuery 3.2.0 that caused the units to be returned in these specific calls. They were not previously being returned, so this was not actually an issue.

* Start running tests against jQuery 2.x

We were only running tests against jQuery 1.x before and they were
all passing. This was a problem because apparently all of the data-*
attribute tests fail in jQuery 2.x.  We are now running both the
integration and unit tests against both jQuery 1.x and jQuery 2.x.

Right now this resulted in a complete duplication of the test files
because there wasn't an obvious way to run the tests against both
versions. We're going to look into removing this duplication in the
future once the current issues are fixed.

We are also going to look into testing against jQuery 3.x in the
future, since that is also a supported line of jQuery.

* Force the data-* attributes to be parsed

There was a change made that switched us from using `$.data` and
`$.fn.data` internally to using an internal data store (managed
through internal utilities). This had the unfortunate side effect
of breaking the automatic loading of data-* options in versions of
jQuery other than 1.x, which included anything that would be
considered modern jQuery. While the change was made and approved
in good faith, all of the tests passed and the docs pages appeared
to be working, the tests really failed when running on newer versions
of jQuery. This was confirmed when we started running automated tests
against both versions, which confirmed the bug that others have been
seeing for a while.

The change was made becuase calling `$.fn.data` on an element which
contains a reference to itself in the internal jQuery data cache
would cause a stack overflow. This bug was well documented at the
following GitHub ticket and was resolved by no longer using
`$.fn.data`: https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/4014

Unfortunately because `$.fn.data` was no longer being called in a
way such that all of the data attributes would be dumped out, we
needed to find a replacement. The substitute that was given in the
original bug fix worked when the data cache was fully primed, but

Select2 will now automatically update the selection if there are options
added to or removed from the DOM within the `<select>` element. This is
supported in all browsers except for Internet Explorer 8. Internet
Explorer 8 does not support the DOM mutation events which were added in
Internet Explorer 9, and it does not support mutation observers which
are the recommended way of handling this in modern browsers.

DOM mutation events also trigger for the `<select>` itself when it is
pulled from the DOM, so we need to filter these out within the event
handler.

Despite supporting mutation observers, we cannot accurately detect if
the removed option was selected at one time or another, so we need to
always re-pull the selection when an element is deleted.

This adds basic support for focusing the Select2 element by triggering
the `focus` event on the underlying <select> element.  This implicitly
adds support for <label> elements, which will trigger the `focus` event
on the `<select>` if it is clicked.

This also fixes the focus issue that previously existed if Select2 was
opened while in a <label>. The focus would be transferred to the search
dropdown, and then immediately pulled away to the <select> element. This
happened because the <label> element triggers the `focus` event when a
`click` event propagates its way up, and we do not stop the propagation
of the `click` event when it is triggered on the selection.

Previously the tokenizer only worked when creating multiple options
at once if all of the options existed. It always worked when creating
a single option, because all of the special cases were handled by the
tagging module. When working with multiple options, the tagging
module does not kick in until after the query has been run, which
is when the tokenizer does its magic.

This fixes the issue by automatically creating the option tags that
the tagging module would normally create. It only does this if the
options do not already exist, so we don't need to worry about the
tokenizer creating duplicates of existing options.

There was a commit that landed in 4.0.1 that fixed positioning for
non-static elements, which are commonly used for the custom
`dropdownParent` option, but broke positioning for statically positioned
elements, commonly used in almost every other case. That commit was
https://github.com/select2/select2/commit/c9216b4b966653dd63a67e815b47899ef5325298

This fixes the positioning issues caused by that commit by properly
calculating the offsets for statically positioned parents. Statically
positioned parents are unique, because the offset for the dropdown must
be calculated based on the closest element that is non-statically
positioned. Otherwise, the offset for any statically positioned parent
other than the body will be considerably higher than it should be,
resulting in the dropdown being offset by a large amount.

The offset parent for the body element is the html element, which is why
this works for both the body element and any custom parents for the
dropdown. This would not be needed if the parent wasn't customizable (as
seen in Select2 3.x) because you will never need to offset the body
element if it is statically positioned, because the html element almost
never has an offset.

This also fixes JSHint issues within the tests added in the last commit.

This adds a regression test that verifies the problem with positioning
the dropdown when the parent is a statically positioned element that
still has an offset. This could typically be seen if the body element
has an offset, which unfortunately it almost always does because of the
default user stylesheet in browsers. This was not caught during
pre-release testing because all of the test pages reset the margins and
padding on the body element.

This regression test verifies that the offsets that should be set for
the dropdown are calculated correctly. These were surprisingly difficult
to do because of how the offset is calculated using different
positioning techniques.

This fixes a previous bug with the backspace handler on the multiple
select search box where unselecting a choice through the keyboard would
not properly size the search box. As a result, most of the text would be
cut off and it was very clear that there was an issue.

In addition, a blank space was automatically being added to the end of
the search query. This blank space would not be removed at all, so the
user had to manually remove it.

Additionally, a query would be triggered for the last used search term
instead of the new search term that would be loaded in. This caused
incorrect results to be displayed most of the time.

All of these issues have been fixed by triggering a new search query
after an option has been removed through the keyboard. This will resize
the search box automatically, which fixes the main issue, and it will
trigger a search with the correct query.

returning the results for the last element in the list instead of the
first element. Because the previous functionality was considered
unspecified behaviour, this is not being treated as a breaking change.

This fixes an issue where the old `option` and `load-more` classes were
not switched over to the newer BEM style of class names. Unfortunately
this is a breaking change, but this is also a bug given that it doesn't
follow the proper prefixing and is likely to conflict with larger

About  `errorLoading`:
Before the correction, the translation was: ""התוצאות לא נטענו בהלכה"".
The word ""בהלכה"" is wrong and should be spelled ""כהלכה"", but besides that, this translations means ""The results were loaded improperly"", while my corrected translation means ""Error while loading results"", which is what needed.

About `inputTooLong`, `inputTooShort`, `maximumSelected`:
In Hebrew, it's not acceptable to have the digit 1 for representing a single object. You should use the actual word ""one"", which is ""אחד"" in Hebrew together with the singular noun (e.g. ""one item"" / ""one character"", instead of ""1 item"" / ""1 character"").
**These 3 parts needed a critical fix anyway**, because they were addind the English letter 's' to the end of the Hebrew string.

About `loadingMore`:
The translation was ""טען תוצאות נוספות"" which means ""Load more results"", as an instruction, probably a typo.
I changed ""טען"" to ""טוען"" so now it means ""loading more results"", which is the correct form.

The `createTag` option does allow for `null` to be returned if a
tag should not be created. The tokenizer previously didn't support
this, so the tokenizer should be able to handle this case. Previously
it would trigger an exception, because the tokenizer would pass back
a null value to the select function.

This also fixes what would have been a potential bug where even if a
tag was not created, the term would still have been sliced at the
location of the token. This allows for tokenizers to have special
cases when tokenizing the term, such as not splittting a token
if it is in the middle of a quoted string.

In the previous commit (02cca7b) support was added for multiple
selects to automatically focus when they were tabbed into. While
this did actually work, it caused a few bugs with the focus that
prevented users from tabbing out of the container, effectively
trapping keyboard users in Select2.

This makes a few major changes to how things work in Select2, but
should not break any backwards compatibility.

 - The internal `focus` event is now proxied through a `focus`
   method on the core object. This allows for two important things

   1. The `focus` event will only be triggered if Select2 was in an
      unfocused state.
   2. Select2 now (unofficially) supports the `select2('focus')`
      method again.

   But that does mean that it is possible to trigger the `focus`
   event now and not have it propagate throughout the widget. As
   it would previously trigger multiple times, even when Select2
   had not actually lost focus, this is considered a fix to a bug
   instead of a breaking change.

 - The internal `blur` event in selections is only triggered when
   the focus is moved off of all elements within the selection. This
   allows for better tracking of where the focus is within Select2,
   but as a result of the asynchronous approach it does mean that the
   `blur` event is not necessarily synchronous and may be more
   difficult to trace.

 - On multiple selects, the standard selection container is never
   visually focused. Instead, the focus is always shifted over to
   the search box when it is requested. The tab index of the selection
   container is also always copied to the search box, so the search
   will always be in the tab order instead of the selection container.

It's important to note that these changes to the tab order and how
the focus is shifted do not apply to multiple selects that do not
have a search box. Those changes also do not apply to single select
boxes, which will still have the same focus and tabbing behaviours
as they previously did."

In the past, `initSelection` was used for loading in data objects
for the pre-selected options. Now that Select2 is using a `<select>`
element, there is no need for doing this because the `<option>`
elements should provide the relevant information. So you can now
just pull this information from the remote data source
(or static array, in some cases) and build out the `<option>`
elements manually.

In most cases you don't need to go the full length with a custom
data adapter, but instead are just looking to pre-load elements on
the initial page load.

Now we do not have separate AMD builds, instead we use a UMD wrapper
to support both AMD and CommonJS environments along with the browser.
This has been tested with RequireJS and it correctly imports Select2
and hooks into jQuery.

This means that all builds will include the Almond AMD loader, but
this isn't that much of an issue when you consider the file sizes.
The loader is namespaced so RequireJS and other AMD builders don't
complain about `require` and `define` existing. This is also done
so AMD loaders don't conflict, as Select2's AMD loader should
operate independently of others.

There are now two layers of wrappers that are applied to files,
only one of which is used for the translation files. This allows
us to only load in the internal Select2 modules once, and in
general makes most things cleaner. These have also been pulled out
into individual JS files instead of being stored in JSON files,
allowing us to add comments and make things look readable.

Because we use a few hacks, these files are heavily commented as well.

Previously, when in results the enter key would select items that
were highlighted if they were not already selected.  In the case of
a select where multiple items could be selected, pressing enter
when highlighting a selected item would also allow it to be
unselected.  While this seems intuitive for accessibility purposes,
the enter button essentially working as a toggle, it caused some
really strange behavior.

- If the enter button was held down, all previously selected items
  would be unselected.
- The enter button did not work the same across both single and
  multiple selects.

After listening to user feedback, I have decided to remove the
""enter as toggle"" functionality from Select2 and have gone back to
just having the enter button select items.  This means that instead
of unselected items that are already selected and highlighted,
Select2 will just close the dropdown.  This is the same as what
Select2 would previously do for single selects, so the keyboard
functionality is now the same across both.

Because this removed the only easy way to unselect items in the
dropdown using the keyboard, we had to maintain the toggle
functionality.  We decided to implement the toggle functionality
on the CTRL + Space keybinding, which is in line with other
applications.  Now when pressing CTRL + Space at the same time in
the dropdown, the highlighted result will behave the same as if the
mouse selected it, which will toggle the current item in multiple
select mode and close the dropdown in single select mode.

This is the same keybinding that Windows Explorer [1] and GTK [2]
use for toggling the current selection, which was why it was picked.

This also fixes an issue where keyboard focus would be lost once an
item was unselected from the results.  This was due to a bug in the
CloseOnSelect module that would only automatically close the
dropdown when an item was selected, but not when an item was
unselected.  Now the dropdown will be closed automatically when an
item is unselected, which will also cause the selection (and
eventually the search) to be focused.

This fixes two issues described in
https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/3036#issuecomment-76321411.

This fixes an issue where most keys would not trigger the search
in Firefox for Android.  There were only a few keys which would
trigger `keyup`, such as space and enter (the search icon), but
they were not consistent.  We know that they were being triggered
though, as you could type ""new "" (note the space) and it would
trigger a search, giving us all states that started with ""new"".

The problem is that Firefox for Android does not consistently
trigger `keyup` and `keydown` events when a keyboard is used.  To
work around the issue, we are now using the `input` event in
replacement of the `keyup` event, which was used to trigger the
search.  While this is not an actual `KeyboardEvent` in Chrome, and
lacks some of the important metadata such as `which`/`key` in
Firefox, it works for our implementation.

As the `input` event is not supported in older browsers, such as
those before Internet Explorer 9, we have to listen for both the
old `keyup` event and the new `input` event.  As the `input` event
is always triggered before the `keyup` event, we unbind the `keyup`
event automatically to prevent searches from being triggered twice.
This solution was discovered in a blog post by Mathias Bynens at
https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/oninput.

**Note:** The ability to backspace in a blank text field on multiple
selects in order to remove the last selected item does not work in
Firefox for Android because the `keydown` event does not trigger
when the text field is empty.  Users can still use the ""x"" icon

This fixes the fallback path for the `data-ajax-url` attribute on
elements.  As this attribute was previously supported in Select2,
the attribute has been migrated to the new, nested format of the
url and triggers a deprecation warning when it is used.  Because
of a fix to the `data-*` attribute parsing made in a9f6d64 that
allowed for nested attributes to be parsed correctly in modern
browsers under jQuery 1.x, the deprecation warning would be
triggered but the attribute would no longer actually be used.

This also fixes some of the `.data` calls to use the camel cased
version of the key instead of the dashed version, which is the
preferred key and will be enforced in future versions of jQuery
as the only way to access data attributes.

Now in situations where the `dataset` attribute is used by Select2,
it combines the results of both `$e.data()` and `e.dataset` when
generating the object containing all of the options.  This will
the `dataset` fix to still be used, while also still relying on
jQuery to do additional parsing on any options that it can.

The `dataset` fix is now only used on jQuery 1.x, as that is the
only version of jQuery affected by the dash issue.  This is done
using version number parsing on the `$.fn.jquery` property that is
defined by jQuery.  As this property is not defined in Zepto and
many other jQuery compatible checks, we only include the fallback
if the property is available.  This assumes that any jQuery
compatible libraries that are in use will not include the same dash
issue, which we believe is a safe assumption given that it did not
match the HTML `dataset` specification.

This also adds a few tests to ensure that the deprecated attributes
still continue to function.

This adds backwards compatibility back into Select2 for `<input />`
tags.  The compatibility modules are only available in the full
version and will trigger a warning if a hidden input is being used.

With the new decorator, Select2 should support the basic operations
that it previously did, with the exception of completely overriding
the internal objects. As we no longer expose `data` as a writable
method, it is no longer possible to completely override the selected
data. The state is still managed internally, but in order to prevent
data corruption issues in the past, it is not exposed to the public.

Some small changes needed to be made to how Select2 was dynamically
generating new `<option>` tags, so now a method is called that can
be overridden. In the case of the new decorator, this method is
intercepted and handled without having to actually place the
`<option>` tags into the DOM.

The decorator is applied after all of the other defaults, as the
defaults are not given the current element.

There has only been limited testing with this decorator, primarily
using the `data` and `placeholder` options.

The `closeOnSelect` option was previously used to control whether
or not the dropdown was closed when an option was selected.  This
could be simulated by triggering the `open` event after the `close`
event was received, but it makes sense to abstract it out into a
decorator.

This also adds support for not closing the dropdown when the control
key is being held.  This is useful when multiple options need to be
selected in quick succession, so the dropdown does not have to be
reopened.

This prevents scrolling within scrollable containers (excluding the
dropdown) when the dropdown is open. This fixes an issue where the
dropdown would go out of sync with the parent container when the
parent container was scrolled.

We did not have this issue in past versions of Select2 because the
mask prevented any scrolling. Now that we have removed the mask, we
have to deal with scrolling from different areas of the page.

We initially tried to hook into the `scroll` events of the parent
containers, but because of a list of issues we decided against it.
If the container scrolled out of view, the dropdown would still be
left open and above everything else, even though the container
wasn't visually connected to it.

The `scroll` event does not bubble, so we need to attach the `scroll`
handler to every parent element that is scrollable. Since it is
surprisingly difficult to determine if an element is scrollable,
we modified some CC-BY-SA code and use that to determine if the
element has a scrollbar. The original `hasScroll` function can be
found at http://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/13338, the same link
left within the code, and was originally designed to be a sizzle
selector. As Select2 does not require a sizzle-compatible version of
jQuery, we converted it into a function that could be used with
`.filter` to filter down the elements.

When we re-implemented support for responsive widths, through the
use of percentages, we never moved the support over to the dropdowns.
So the dropdowns generally were not large enough, and when resized
they never re-adjusted, and they didn't fully work as intended.

This fixes the issue by automatically resizing the dropdown whenever
it is repositioned, mainly to handle new scrollbars, which will
ensure that it is always the same width as the container.

This also adds a section to the examples for responsive design,
just like in the old documentation.

This reverts the changes (from 3.5.x) to the scroll detection, so
Select2 will still reposition itself every time the window is
scrolled or resized. This has the benefit of fixing the issue when
the screen jumps if the dropdown is too high, which would previously
close the dropdown.

Select2 will also correctly set the positioning if it is pushed out
of the top of the viewport. Due to an unexpected bug, Select2 would
previously still display above the container, but would be styled
as if it were below it.

This adds a check that triggers an error if Select2 was not able
to detect a copy of jQuery on the page. This should help users when
they are setting up Select2.

**Breaking change:** The full build no longer includes jQuery.
Previously, the full build included all requirements for Select2,
including jQuery, which meant that anyone looking for the optional
requirements had to possibly include multiple versions of jQuery
on their page. This means that anyone requiring Select2 to also
bundle jQuery will now need to include jQuery on their pages
alongside Select2. A copy of jQuery is included in the repository.

**Breaking change:** The AMD build of Select2 will now correctly
wrap the code in a `define` block. It will still create the named
blocks inside of the code, which should be valid in most AMD build
systems, so now Select2 is compatible with cases where the file
does not have the same name as the Select2 module name.

**Breaking change:** Select2 will re-use the AMD methods if they
are available on the page, but it will not longer leak the included
AMD loader to the global scope. The AMD methods will still be
available on the `jQuery.fn.select2.amd` namespace.

The `mock.js` test file has been renamed to `helpers.js` and will
handle the escalation of the `require` and `define` variables to
the global scope. It should be included in all test files, or the
tests will fail.

When `jQuery.noConflict` is called, the global `$` variable is not

This fixes all of the issues where we are assuming that `$` is
defined globally when we are not importing the module. This also
fixes the issues when defining the `jQuery.fn.select2.amd` modules

In the past, Select2 triggered the `select2-clearing` event when

event which is now triggered whenever the placeholder is cleared.
The placeholder can also be prevented if the `unselecting` event
is prevented.

This will also trigger the event when deleting every option from
the multiple select, so it is possible for the `unselecting` event
to be triggered multiple times when clearing a multiple select.

emulate it through data objects still, and just handle the display
of the data in the results.

This also means that the horrific deep-nested CSS is back to handle
the padding. I hope that will get fixed over time.

This also fixes one of the performance issues with adding array
data, as options are added at the very end instead of one by one."

Up until now, the container could only have a dropdown that was
displayed below the container. While this worked well, there are
some cases where the dropdown should be displayed above the
container. Most notably, this is when the conatainer is displayed
towards the bottom of the page, and displaying the dropdown would
cause the page to be extended. Because we close the dropdown
when the page is scrolled, the user would not be able to access any
options that were displayed outside of the viewpoint.

Because of the order that events are fired, we attach the handlers
for repositioning the dropdown after results are displayed when the
container is opened for the first time.  This allows it to be
registered after the results container registers their events, so
the dropdown is repositioned after the results have been displayed.

The logic for determining the direction that the dropdown will be
shown in is very similar to the positioning code used in
Select2 3.x. Unlike previous versions of Select2, a class is used
to indicate the direction of the dropdown, even if it is displaying
below the container.

The themes provided with Select2 have been updated to correctly
render the dropdown in both directions."

When the dropdown is in the dropdown that is attached to the body,
the call to `show` causes `display: inline` to be set directly on

This improves the speeds of creating the `<option>` tags for array
data. By creating the HTML ahead of time and putting it into an
`<option>` element before passing it to jQuery, it cuts down on the
time it takes for jQuery to process the HTML string and convert it
into DOM elements. This proved to be incredibly slow.

This also changes the `item` function to return early when the
data exists. The `$e.data` call has also been switched to a
`$.data` call, which doesn't need to check the DOM to see if the
data attributes already exist. This cuts down on a bit of wasted
time, as the `data` key should never be present in the DOM, and it
should be ignored if it is."

This converts individual objects passed in through the `array`
parameter to `<option>` tags when Select2 is initialized. This
removes a lot of duplicate code from the `ArrayAdapter`, and keeps
everything closer to the native `<select>` element.

This introduces a breaking change from previous versions of Select2,
where the initial value for array data was blank, even if a blank
option was not present in the original array of objects. Now the
first object passed in will be selected by default, following the
behavior of a standard `<select>` element.

Placeholder support has been implemented as a separate module, so
any selection container should be able to be decorated and get
instant placeholder support. It hooks into the updating method of
selections, and determines when to display the placeholder based
on the options that are being updated.

It works in the same way as the old placeholders. If no options
are selected and being displayed, like in the case of a multiple
select, then the placeholder will always be shown.  If one option
is being displayed, and the id of the placeholder matches the id
of the selected element, then the placeholder will be shown.  This
is similar to the functionality that was present in Select2 2.x,
where the placeholder could be passed in as an object that would
be compared to the selection.

This still requires that, for single selects, the first element
must match the placeholder id.  Because the default placeholder id
is a blank string, this will maintain backwards compatibility with
past versions where the first option should be blank.  This can
still be overridden to point at a different id, keeping support
for systems where the placeholder doesn't use a blank value.

**Note:** This does not hide the blank option for single selects,
but that will still be maintained for backwards compatibility
within the results module.  It will not depend on a placeholder
being present, but instead will hide any options with blank text."

Lines [1499](https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/blob/d487fc58a889b471f7d587cc61baeca1d68de633/select2.js#L1499) and [1509](https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/blob/d487fc58a889b471f7d587cc61baeca1d68de633/select2.js#L1509) make a call to `child.offset().top`. I don't know what's causing `child.offset()` to return undefined, but it is and it's breaking Select2 so that I can't select the last item in the list (this error occurs when I try hovering over or clicking on the last item in a list).

I can try and create a reduced case, but this fix is 100% backward compatibe, passes all the tests you have for the project and has a 0% chance of breaking anyone's working code. With this patch, my dropdown works just fine. At worst, this does *nothing* for people, at best, it fixes a rare edge case. Like my edge case. And I'm a pretty important person to me."

In the stable version this line looks like:

dropLeft = offset.left + width - dropWidth;

In line (1193) the variable width is set to dropWidth which means we are always going to end up with 

dropLeft = offset.left + X - X
or
dropLeft = offset.left

Which means we are still aligned to the left of the button.

This current solution from @ef9f1dea is just aligning the select2-drop closer to the center which is not what it did before the dropdownAutoWidth.

The function will now pass all properties of the objects passed as tags to the constructor, not just the ""id"" and ""text"" properties. Because a tag is not always just an id and a text, just like when you provide the items with the ""data"" object instead.

This makes sure these properties are always available at the runtime of formatSelection() or formatResult(), which is not currently the case when the field is repopulated on a triggered ""change"" event.

My code looks like this :

$el.select2({
...,
tags: [{
  //id
  id: 1,
  //the string that will matched against the user's query
  text: 'martin smith greatmartin@provider.com'
  //the label of the item that will be shown if this tag is selected
  label: 'M. Smith',
}],
formatSelection: function(object, container){
  return object.label || object.text;
},
//right now I have to override the default function:
initSelection: function(){...}
});"

When using hierarchical data there is a random scroll jump when hovering over select options. The reason is that in the case of hierarchical data the highlightable choices are <ul> and thus their outer height is many pixels (includes the children's height as well). A fix is to make the height calculations by using the the label divs."

The string 
opts.element.attr(""multiple"") 
returns:
1) string ""multiple"" - if element have attribute multiple (<select name=""..."" multiple></select>)
2) undefined - if element have not attribute multiple (<select name=""...""></select>)
It is written in the documentation:
""As of jQuery 1.6, the .attr() method returns undefined for attributes that have not been set.""
""To retrieve and change DOM properties, use the .prop() method.""
(http://api.jquery.com/attr/)

I am propose use ""prop"" function. The string
opts.element.prop(""multiple"")
returns:
1) boolean ""true"" - if element have attribute multiple
2) boolean ""false"" - if element have not attribute multiple

After, the ""multiple"" variable use in check of the condition:
select2 = multiple ? new MultiSelect2() : new SingleSelect2();
Better use true/false variable value than ""multiple""/undefined in this condition.

Fix for issue #934. The default initSelection uses a matcher to find
items that match the selection, but if the data is hierarchical what
the matcher returns may actually be grouping elements, so they can't be
treated as a list of matching items.  This fix runs the matcher but
rather than using its return value it collects the matching item(s)

jquery offset() returns incorrect value when ancestor container has css transform applied to it, causing dropdown to appear in incorrect position.

Using { top: variable.offsetTop, left: variable.offsetLeft } instead of variable.offset() fixes this issue
