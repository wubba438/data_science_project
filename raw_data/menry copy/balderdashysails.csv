This allows config files like `/config/foo.bar.js` to be read in, instead of being ignored.

Note that for modules that derive their identity from the filename, it's up to the hook that loads the module to deal with dots.

The only time ""replace"" would encounter a uniqueness error is if there was concurrent logic running somewhere that was messing around with the database at the same time  (it could never occur due to duplicates in the array of new child ids because of [this](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline/blob/7b3e5f3229a9caef4bdb6a5e3cdb4868d0717141/lib/waterline/utils/query/private/normalize-pk-value-or-values.js#L89-L91)).  Since we don't currently use transactions in blueprints (and because, in some cases e.g. xD/A or adapters that don't support `join`, we'll never be able to use transactions), we handle this with a 500 error for now (because in the database could be in an a intermediate state, and this endpoint doesn't attempt to rectify that).  In the future, in the case where this blueprint action was able to use a transaction, it should respond with a 409 instead (because any changes we made would have been rolled back automatically due to the failure)."

* The former `publish` method is now officially private, and renamed to `_publishRPS`
* All formerly public RPS methods (e.g. `publishCreate`) are now private, with an underscore as a reminder
* Contexts are no more -- they were never documented, and thus underutilized.  RPS methods now all broadcast to the '*' subroom of an instance (e.g. `sails_model_user_123:*`), and continue to use the model identity as the event name.
* The public `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` methods now take an optional `room` argument, defaulting to the model identity.  This will be documented as `event` (see notes about `message` below)
* The former `message` method is now the public `publish` method, using `(records, event, data, req)` signature.  The `event` also doubles as the room name, for simplicity.  So end users can subscribe a socket to the `foo` event using `User.subscribe(req, userId, 'foo');`, publish using `User.publish(userId, foo, {})`, and listen on the client with `io.socket.on('foo', ...)`."

I'm not entirely familiar with the submission process. If you notice something missing, or the issue does not follow the guidelines completely, I'll submit a corrected version as soon as possible. 

===Summary===
Currently Sails CORS hooks are implemented in a way that differs a bit from the formal specification and can cause some undesired effects in certain enviroments. The primary cause are some blank headers set by Sails that should not be present as far as the aforementioned specification is concerned. While it doesn't matter in most cases, it may prevent other software that sits in from of the Node.js server from setting their own headers unless the CORS hook is disabled. In order to get a ""sane"" behavior, as well as minimizing the information one ""attacker"" may be able to obtain from a response, the removal of the blank headers is suggested in all cases but those explicitly required to be compliant with the present conventions regarding request processing. I.e., Sails method to clear CORS headers should effectively remove the headers themselves, not set them to '', and request processing should be terminated in case no matching origin for the request is found, instead of sending Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ''.


The proposal also suggests 2 new additions:
  The first one leverages the use of the ""Vary"" header to allow Sails CORS to work with some reverse proxys used for caching. Without that header, a reverse proxy as Varnish, may cache a single version of the response, allowing only a single origin to access the representation of the response. If two or more origins are allowed, then only the origin present in the first request is going to be cached, effectively denying the access from requests from any of the other hosts. If the request is not allowed, then no hosts will be allowed until the request expires from cache. 
- Higher security levels preventing the request from being processed such as those returning status codes 400, 500, etc. shouldn't be a real concern, as those won't be normally cached. 

 The second one would allow the usage of Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * in the response in case of public resources without access checks. This would allow caching of resources even when the Vary header is not supported. 

Both options would be disabled by default, and their usage would be completely optional.

==Required changes==
The changes described in the previous section affect core elements of Sails, and can not be implemented extending it. On top of that, they would require either changes in the test suite ( the first change in particular), or new tests to cover the new functionality (the second and third changes). 

The affected files, without any particular order would be:

===CORS hook===
- clear-headers.js => Replace the usage of ""res.set"" for ""res.removeHeader""
- to-prepare-send-headers.js => Minor code changes

===Tests===
- test/integration/hook.cors_csrf.test.js => Modification of assertions of the headers from denied requests. Inclussion of new tests.

===Backend generator, from sails-generate-backend===
- templates/config/cors.js => Addition of the new configuration options, if considered relevant.

===Documentation===
Update the relevant information in the documentation, providing examples, if required.

I'd like to ask for forgiveness in case someone finds the present description ""a bit rude"". English is not my mother first language and I had trouble to phrase some of the contents in this proposal. It was in no way my intention to offend any of the contributors behind Sails, or to disrespect them or the project itself. I lack experience contributing to other open source projects and did it with the sole purpose of trying be of helpful in regards to the issue at hand."

As for the globally exposed lodash, plan is to put that in the world of generators; which will also allow individual apps which are using global lodash (most of us) to manage their global lodash version independently from sails core)"

There is a long-standing open bug in consolidate - https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js/issues/143 - which causes errors in the callback functions passed to rendering methods to propogate back into the try/catch contained in consolidate and cause the callback to be fired twice. Since this bug has been open in consolidate for over two years, not much hope should be held of having it resolved there.

As such, add protection in Sails against errors in the callback functions being caught inside consolidate and the callback fired twice by forcing the callback to be called asynchronously."

This fixes a bug which causes Sails to become unresponsive (or even
crash) when a message portraying an OPTIONS request for an undefined
route is emitted over the socket.io REST interface.

Steps to reproduce:

In a terminal:
$ sails new killme
$ cd killme
$ sails lift

In a browser's JS console (on localhost:1337):
> io.socket.request({method: 'options', url: '/anUndefinedRoute'});

The issue is a result of using Express' router with a constructed
response object which does not meet expectations set by Express.
For OPTIONS requests, Express' router enters a code path where send()
is called on the result of res.set() (see line 188 of lib/router/index.js
in Express v3.x). When/if set() is not chainable, we trigger an
infinite loop which brings Sails down.

The patch could have undesirable side effects if the value previously
returned from set() is used somewhere. I could not find any such
occurences in this repository. In any case, this should be considered
a quick-fix, since ideally, we should not use a third-party router at
all, to avoid similar issues (in other words, fix the TODO on line 46
in router/index.js).

The issue happens with Express v3.x, possibly not an issue in later
versions where the relevant code seems to have been subjected to
major refactorizations."

Sails uses fs-extra. On production, my app now doesn't start because it's missing fs-extra. Example: `node_modules/sails/lib/router/res.js`

Output on my server:

```
islive@node01 ~/apps/fortress (master)
$ node app.js
{ [Error: Cannot find module 'fs-extra'] code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND' }
To run an app using `node app.js`, you usually need to have a version of `sails` installed in the same directory as your app.
To do that, run `npm install sails`

Alternatively, if you have sails installed globally (i.e. you did `npm install -g sails`), you can use `sails lift`.
When you run `sails lift`, your app will still use a local `./node_modules/sails` dependency if it exists,
but if it doesn't, the app will run with the global sails instead!
```

After installing fs-extra in node_modules everything worked just fine."

skipRegex (RegExp/array): Regular expression (or array of regular expressions) to match URL against, and SKIP the specified middleware if it matches.  Used by skipAssets internally."

Been a bit wishy-washy on this, but it just makes sense to have it in both places, even if it means it will usually be called twice.  If you override the ""create"" action and call ""publishCreate"", the expected behavior will be that watchers get introduced to the new model.  Similarly, if you use the blueprint ""create"" but override ""publishCreate"", I think you'd still expect watchers to be introduced, unless you're overriding publishCreate `explicitly` to suppress the introduction.  For that reason, an options parameter has been added to publishCreate that will allow you to suppress the introduction without overriding the whole method."

Accomplishes this by faking a cookie on the socket, newing up a session, and maintaining that session for the life of the socket.  At some point, a method needs to be figured out of associating a proper session instead-- maybe by sending a surrogate token back to the server on subsequent requests.  Alternatively, if sails.io.js client accomplishes full emulation of http cookies, the Connect middleware can just be used directly.  This would be optimal, I think."

In either case, this makes DirtyLocksmith transactions single-node dependent, which is problmatic.  Instead, in production, you'd want to use a different adapter for transactions (anything with auto-increment built in).  However, on the waterline side, it would be better to ELIMINATE the dirtyLocksmith, use DirtyDb instead, but then remove the reliance within DirtyAdapter on transactions (use in-memory auto-increment).  Dirty is not supposed to be used in production anyways.  Then we would *not* use id, we would use some other obscure attribute like __transaction_insert_id and assign it the autoIncrement propeorty."
