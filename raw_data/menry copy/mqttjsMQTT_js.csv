* Fixed #952.

Conditional flush `outgoing` on close.

Scenario:
1. The client connect to the server.
2. The client sends subscribe to the server.
3. The server destroys the client connection before suback sending.
4. The client detect `close` event, then reconnects to the server.

At the step4, `outgoing` still stored the callback for
subscribe. However, it has never called because server doen't send
corresponding suback.
The same thing happens on unsubscribe.

So I defined subscribe/unsubscribe as volatile.
The volatile type of `outgoing` entries should be cleared when `close`
from the server is detected.

On the contrary, QoS1 and QoS2 publish is not volatile. Because they are
resent after reconnection. And then, callback in the `store` is
called. This behavior shouldn't be changed.

So I added `volatile` flag to `outgoing` element.

* Fixed cb accessing code.

If `outgoing[mid]` doesn't match, then accessing `outgoing[mid].cb`
causes `Cannot read property` error. So added checking code.

Fixed outgoing assignment at `_onConnect` function."

* Fix publish interrupt during stored packets processing.

If `publish()` is called during stored packets processing, store the packet id into `packetIdsDuringStoreProcessing` kvs. The key is packet id and the value is boolean (true: prossesed, false: not processed). At this time, the value is false. If the packet is actually sent, the value is set to true.

When stream process reaches the end, check all of `packetIdsDuringStoreProcessing` are processed, if it doens't, try again flowing process from the beginning. In this process, already processed (but not removed yet because puback is not receieved) packets should be skipped. In order to do that, check  `packetIdsDuringStoreProcessing` value. If it is true, skip it.

* Add '_' prefix to internal properties.

* Refactoring to increase codecov."

This commit fixes above problem.

Added preserving publish order functionality to `Store` using `es6-map`.

`es6-map` can preserve insertion order.
If target environment is ES6, `es6-map` is native ES6 Map, otherwise use
fallback implementation that has the same interface as ES6 Map.

Updated some tests that depends on Store's internal structure (_inflights).

Added test to check publish order when reconnects."

Even if reconnectPeriod is 0, client should resend publish/purel
packet when clean is false.
So I removed `that.options.reconnectPeriod > 0` guard condition from
the connect handler.

Added resend from pubrel functionality.
In the following scenario, resend message should be pubrel.

1. Client connects to the broker with clean session false.
2. Client publishes QoS 2 message.
3. Broker receives the message and send pubrec to the client.
4. Client receives the pubrec message and send pubrel to the broker.
5. Client disconnects from the broker.
6. Client reconnects to the broker.
7. Client receives connack from the broker.
8. Client should resend pubrel automatically.

When `_sendPacket()` is called, if the packet type is `pubrel` then
call `storeAndSend()` instead of `send`acket()`.

Added tests for them."

I have setup a small mqtt cluster with 2 nodes on Kubernetes. If I try to run your example I sometime miss the `Hello mqtt` message, and the sample app just keep running.
If I change the example by moving the publish inside the callback I always get the message and the app correctly close.

Can this be caused by the fact that the publish doesn't wait the subscribe to be sucesfully? Maybe I connect to another node of the cluster or some concurrency issue?

Can you confirm that it is better to wait for the subscriber before sending the message? I know that this is probably a not real world scenario, but..."

In QoS2 sequence,
when the client receives `publish`, the messege is stored into
`incomingStore` and sends pack `pubrec`. Then the server sends `pubrel`
to the client. Finally,  the client calls `handleMessage` with stored
message. If no errors are hannpened, `pubcomp` will be sent, but any errors
are happened, `pubcomp` shouldn't be sent.
This test is for the error case, so I replaced the description."

If the client publishes faster than the keepalive interval, PINGREQ messages keep getting rescheduled and will not be sent.  If connectivity is lost between the client and the broker during such a period, the client may not be able to detect that its published messages aren't reaching the broker.  This change introduces a new option ('fastClientDisconnectDetect') to *not* reschedule PINGREQ messages when sending packets.

This is in accordance with the MQTT spec v3.1.1, paragraph 3.1.2.10 (Keep Alive), which states that clients may send PINGREQ at any time:
```
The Client can send PINGREQ at any time, irrespective of the Keep Alive value, and use the PINGRESP to determine that the network and the Server are working.
