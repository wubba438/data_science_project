Having methods that mixed ReadablePartials/ReadableInstants was a bit
overkill.  First, it cluttered up the class, making it harder to tell
what method you wanted to use.  Second, its behavior is too random.
Depending on what partials you pass in, random fields get filled in
between it and ReadableInstant it usually needs to be converted into.

By keeping everything partial or instant, we have a grounding for
comparing the parameters and keep things a bit more succinct."

I'm not a huge fan of having compiled data in the source; but
there's no other way for someone to easily check out the source and
start using it immediately otherwise right now (unless they can use
apklibs or aars, not something I want to assume at this point)."

It takes its paths and converts them into something that can be placed
inside of an Android resource directory.  In particular:

- It removes all directory references, replacing them with underscores.
  This makes it output to a single directory.

- It replaces some commonly seen illegal characters in TZ identifiers
  with something Android can use.

- Prefixes all files with ""__tzdata_"" to keep them separate from any
  other resources that someone might be using."
