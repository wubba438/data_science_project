When scrolling horizontally, `axisName` has value `""scrollLeft""`. Since

Use the `direction` argument in the condition instead, which is set to
`""x""` when scrolling horizontally with `h` and `l`.

First, I *very rarely* use local marks.  They just don't seem as useful
in a browser as they are in a text editor.

However, on a page like GMail, I do often want to jump back and forward
between my labels.  These are different locations hashes (anchors).

The idea here is to make local marks useful for this case.

If the scroll positions (X and Y) are both 0, and the hash (anchor) is
present in the mark and non-empty, then change the hash instead of
scrolling.

On first tests, this appears to work nicely for changing labels in
GMail.  I'm sure there are other uses.

This change shouldn't interfere with use cases where the user has
scrolled within the page."

This should fix *most* problems from Firefox issue 1408996[1].

The root cause of the bug is that document.domain is set, and Firefox
discards the 'expando' for the window that contains all properties we
set. Technically, this can happen at any time, and so some failures are
still possible. This fixes #2799.

  Comments:
  Thank you for your contribution.

  Please note the following for the next update:
  1) For inserting text, textContent (or JQuery text) or createTextNode() should be used instead of innerHTML.
  eg: $(&quot;saveOptions&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;Save Changes&quot;;

So, here, `.innerHTML` is replaced with `.textContent` for elements

- For PDF tabs, we see keydown events but we don't see the corresponding
  keypress events, so this allows us to navigate through PDF tabs with
  J/K.

- This relies on using `event.key` instead of `event.keyIdentifier`
  (which is no longer supported).

- Also move mapkey handling into the keyboard utils.

The effect of all of this is to simplify and unify much of our key
handling.

Fixes #1243 (for tab commands).

There are known places where we can prune a considerable amount of key
handling code.  However, that code is left in place for now in case this
change throws up some unexpected issues."

Steps to reproduce:

- Press and hold `j`.
- Tab `k`.
- Release `j`.

The tap on `k` is uninstalling the `cancelEventListener` installed by
`j`, and because we advance `@time`, the `j` stops scrolling and
removes the `cancelEventListener` installed for `k`.  So we end up with
no `cancelEventListener` installed.

The fix is to make the `cancelEventListener` specific to the scroller
instance.

The more fundamental problem here is that we're mixing dynamic and
static state.  A better approach would be to have `CoreScroller` as a
class, with a new instance created for each scroll instance."

There are two changes here:

1. Treat built-in key mappings and custom key mappings in the same way;
that is, we prepend the built-in mappings to the custom mappings and
then parse them all together.  This results in a number of
simplifications due to previous duplication of logic and the elimination
of special cases.

2. Parse key mappings in reverse order, so we can just ignore key
mappings after first encountering a key sequence.  So, `map`, `unmap`
and `unmapAll` are all treated in more or less the same way.

This is preparatory to reworking some aspects of the help page.  In
particular, regardless of the order of maps, unmaps, etc., this approach
makes it easier to find the mapping in effect for a key sequence (and be
able to recreate the order of those mappings)."

Here's the problem...

Many sites define their own keyboard shortcuts, for example Google Play
Music defines `gh` for ""go home"".

On such sites, it's natural to set up pass keys for `g` and `h`.

But that makes any Vimium key bindings which begin with `g`
inaccessible.

Here, we add a new command `enterNormalMode` which installs a new
normal-mode instance (without any pass keys).  This executes a single
normal-mode command then exits.

Example:

    map \ enterNormalMode
    map | enterNormalMode count=999999

Assuming `g` and `o` are pass keys:

- `gh` or `o` - use the page's binding
- `\gg` - scroll to top
- `2\ggo` - scroll to the top and open the Vomnibar
- `\g<Escape>o` - open the Vomnibar
- `\<Escape>o` - use the page's bindings
- `\\\\\\<Escape>o` - use the page's bindings (new normal-mode instances
  displace previous ones)

This required some changes to the scroller.  Previously, we only ever
had one normal-mode instance, and could arrange statically that the
scroller's key listeners were above normal-mode's key listeners in the
handler stack.  Here, we fix this by adding and removing the scroller's
listeners dynamically, so they're always at the top of the handler
stack."

Issues:

- Do we want yet another hack like this?  This would be documented only on

- If we allowed `translate <c-c> <c-[>` (and extended `isEscape()` to

- Alternatively, instead of adding a new ""command"" called `translate`,
  we could overload the existing `map` command.  Since these are

  a risk some user has junk in their key mappings and would be taken by
  surprise).

""/"" followed immediately by ""i"" can hang Vimium.

The problem is that launching find mode is asynchronous (we wait until
the HUD is available). Because normal mode is still active, we can enter
insert mode *before* the find-mode HUD receives the focus.

The result is that we end up in both find mode and insert mode, the HUD
has the focus, but the HUD is in insert mode, so it ignores keyboard
events (including `Escape`).

The only way out is to click the page's body and then type `Escape`.

This commit demonstrates the problem: 7d2b00411eae3293fa4c7b1f61b384c0c495b5a2.

This happens in practice, for example while a busy page is loading.

This commit fixes this by ensuring that find-mode blocks keyboard events
immediately (and synchronously) on launch."

This changes the logic for selecting an existing tab when using global marks.

Previously, an exact RUL match was required.  Here, we only require a prefix match.

For example, if the global-mark URL is:

    https://inbox.google.com/u/0/

Then a tab with the URL

    https://inbox.google.com/u/0/sent

will be selected.

This is a more usable approach when the user uses global marks to visit
important sites like gmail, Facebook or Twitter.  On these sites, the
URL changes, but the user still thinks of the tab as their ""gmail tab"",
for example.

Also, when choosing between multiple candidate tabs:

- If there is at least one candidate in the current window, then only consider candidates in the current window.
- If there are more than one candidates, then don't select the current tab.
- Finally, select the remaining candidate with the shortest URL.

- using the vomnibar, visit any other page (in the same tab)
- hit `f` - the link hints fail to load.

What's happening is that the unregister/register frame messages for the
main/top frame arrive in the wrong order (first register, then
unregister).  Because these both have the same frame Id, the effect is
that the main/top frame ends up not registered.  So there are no
registered frames, so link hints mode doesn't launch.

Only the main/top frame has a re-usable frameId (`0`).  All other frames
receive a unique frame Id (which is never re-used).

Here, we just never unregister the main/top frame.  That way, it doesn't
matter which order the register/unregister messages arrive in.  If the
tab is navigating to a new page, then there'll be a new main/top frame
along soon.  If the tab is closing, then we tidy up in the
`chrome.tabs.onRemoved` handler."

This fixes some UI component initialization issues.  It's a long
story...

The problem.

- Go to this page: http://www.thejournal.ie/seanad-election-results-2016-2737768-Apr2016/
- Click one of the links from the ""Most Popular"" box on the right.
- Navigate back (`H`) and, as the original page is loading, activate the Vomnibar.

In 1.54 this renders Vimium unusable.  In `master` this renders the
Vomnibar unsable, but the rest of Vimium usable.

It seems the source of the issue is that we're initializing UI
components too soon.  We need to wait until the `readyState` is
""complete"".

With this PR:

- The Vomnibar is initialised when the `readyState` is ""complete"" (in
  the top frame only, and only if Vimium is enabled).  Requests arriving
  prior to then are silently discarded.
- The HUD is also initialized only when the `readyState` is ""complete"";
  however, requests arriving before then are queued.  So, if the user
  immediately enters insert mode, then the ""Insert mode"" indicator will
  eventually be displayed.
- The help dialog silently discards requests until the `readyState` is
  ""complete.

I'm posting this as a PR because:

1. It needs some visibility.
2. With this, if the `readyState` *never* reaches ""complete"", then the
   Vomnibar would be unusable.  And that's pretty serious."

I seems that we cannot rely upon either the ""unload"" event in the
content script or the port's onDisconnect handler there to unregister
frames.

To see this, go to a frame-busy page like this one:

- https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/26/apple-iphone-first-revenue-decline-13-years

and then navigate to any other simple page (in the same tab).  Navigate
back and forward with `H` and `L`.

If you watch frames registering anf unregistering, almost all of the
frames from the frame-busy page do not unregister.

Here, we unregister frames on onDisconnect in the background page too.

1 in this comment:

Here's why:

- b7535a604954b5873d825eb66bfecd08f1f2c99b is complicated and complex (O(n^2)).
- With experience, it is not obviously better than what was there
  before, and in some cases it's worse.
- b7535a604954b5873d825eb66bfecd08f1f2c99b selects way too much text in
  some cases; e.g. on Google Inbox, it selects text lengths in the tens
  of thousands of characters.  That cannot be useful.
- With global hints, this extra cost (resulting from passing large
  objects between frames) is significant and noticable.
- The simpler approach of accounting for text length when scoring
  filtered hints (tweaked here: 5cbc5ad702a01a81b98f8c82edb3b6d227c2c7b5)
  works better in practice."

HUD: Initialize only when the frame receives the focus and Vimium is enabled.
Vomnibar: Initialize in the top frame when Vimium is enabled in *any* frame.

Warning:  There may be a race condition here.  Specifically, if Vimium
is disabled in the main/top frame (T) but enabled in another frame (A), then the
initialisation could happen in frame A before frame T is listening, so
frame T would miss the initialization message (which is only sent once).

Message listeners are installed early (and probably installed first in
the main/top frame), and the `isEnabledForUrl` messaging takes some
time, so perhaps it's OK.  But it *is* a race condition.

There's a nasty little bug in `removeTab` when you remove more tabs than

- all of the tabs in the currently-focused window are removed
- then, later (so, time passes), when you change tab in the other
  window, we begin removing tabs again!

The source of the bug is our reliance on
`chrome.tabs.onSelectionChanged`, which doesn't first when removing the
last tab in a window (and there is another window).

Regardless, the previous semantics of `<count>removeTab` was
questionable.  It was preactically impossible to predict which tabs
would removed.  This picks the current tab, then those to the right of

This affects the scoring system for filtered link hits, and therefore
affects their usability.

Example link text:

    ""We open all day"", say 7Eleven

Previously:

    ""We
    open
    all
    day"",
    say
    7Eleven

With this PR:

    we
    open
    all
    day
    say
    Eleven

Previously: the typed text `we` and `day` would receive poor scores (not
the start of a word, and not a whole word.  Now, these get high scores,
so are more likely to be selected as the active link.  Also, `7Eleven`
cannot be typed (because `7` is a hint character).

With this PR, the typed text `we` `day` now get high scores, as they
should."

JavaScript's sort function is not stable; this PR makes the sort used for filtered link hints stable.

There are two reasons for doing this:

- High-scoring hints are more likely to keep the same hint string as the user continues typing. (Currently, the hints assigned change based on the vaguaries of the non-stable sort.)

- For equal-scoring hints, we retain the visit-child-before-parent ordering (which is used to NOT match a parent's text if we have already matched that text in a child).

And, as a result of all of that, the UX is more predictable and hence better."

Previously, we initialised modes early, but then installed our listeners
only after DOM ready, and then only after we'd heard back from the
background page in `checkIfEnabledForUrl`.  This creates a gap during
which modes are installed, but they're not receiving events.

If an input is focused during that gap, then we don't pick it up when
the modes are installed, and we don't pick it up when the input is
focussed (because we're not listening).  This commit moves these two
initialisation steps together, so they happen at the same time and there
is no gap.

Fixes #1738."

(@mrmr1993: This is yet another approach to the Settings problem.)

With the new Settings implemetation, settings which have a non-default
value and which are not in synced storage (that is, they have not been
changed since synced storage was introduced) are not currently
accessible to content scripts.  This commit makes such settings
accessible via chrome.storage.local.

Important:
- There's a change to the established settings data model here.
  Previously, settings with default values were not stored; here, they
  are.  This eliminates a considerable amount logic from Settings, but
  means that migrations will be required if default values are changed
  in future.  (Other than type changes, have we ever changed a default
  value?)
- There's also a change (bug fix?) to the behaviour when an affected
  setting is reset to its default value.  Previously, the change would
  *not* have been synced (whereas all other changes are).  Here, such
  changes *are* synced.  The previous behaviour was inconsistent with
  the syncing behaviour of all other options changes.

Note:
- This isn't particularly well tested.  It's being committed mainly just
  for consideration of the approach, initially."

This commit just flips things around a bit such that,
   - onComplete() is called immediately if the history is not actually
     required, and
   - the history cache is primed before it is needed, so it will
     (hopefully) be available before the user's next keystroke.

This is a minor re-working of #1705 from @mrmr1993.

     initialise Settings separately and manually in the background,
     content scripts, options and tests).
   - Get rid of addEventListener (it's only being used for on ""load"").

The Settings object used by the background page now uses 1 of 3 caches,
depending on the context it is available in:
* localStorage - in the background page
* a copy of localStorage - in non-background extension pages
  (options.html, popup.html, etc.)
* an empty object - in all other pages (where localStorage doesn't point
  to the extension's localStorage object).

For any extension page which is *not* the background page, a copy of
localStorage is used instead of true localStorage:
* Once localStorage is updated by one background page, the others can
  only see the updated copy.
  - Pages with an updated cache can't tell which changes are new, and so
    don't know which postUpdateHooks to run.
* By copying localStorage's contents into a new object, extension pages
  can still access settings synchronously.
  - This is especially important to options.html and popup.html; they
    will not work without it."

This is a major reworking of how the search-completion systems works.

Previously, the goal had been to emulate roughly how chrome itself
handles completions.  This has turned out to be a bad idea:

   - It creates issues around what it means to hit <Enter> in the
     vomnibar.
   - And the contents of the vomnibar change asynchronously (because we
     fetch completions asynchronously), so it creates the possibility
     that the effect of <Enter> changes depending on how long the user
     waits before typing <Enter>.

All of that is bad.

This commit changes things:

   - In normal omni mode, the vomnibar looks and behaves pretty much
     like it always has, just with some extra completion suggestions
     thrown in.

   - And in custom-search-engine mode it also behaves mostly as it has
     previously, but (again, possibly) with some extra completion
     suggestions thrown in, and with many useless suggestions excluded.

This is all far more Vimium-like than Chrome-like."

With suggested completions appearing in the vomnibar, the meaning of
<Enter> can change when the completion list is updated, which happens
asynchronously.  The user can end up selecting something they didn't
intend to ... which is bad.

This implements a temporary fix.  When the completion list updates (and
the update might affect what the user expects <Enter> to do), we block
<Enter> for a short time (250ms).  That's pretty bad too.

These UX issues around search completion are proving difficult to get
right.  I will open an issue to discuss them soon."

This makes the behaviour consistent between custom and non-custom
searches when there is no selection in the vomnibar (omni-mode only).

Approach:
   - When there is no selection in the vomnibar, we *always* send the
     query to to background completer (that is, both for default
     searches and for custom searches) and ask the completer to provide
     only the primary suggestion.  The primary suggestion is just what
     you get if you append the query terms to the search URL (default or
     custom).  We then immediately open the first response.

The round trip for default searches isn't strictly necessary.  However,
this uniform approach disentangles some nasty logic in the vomnibar when
we're trying to handle several cases (default or custom search, with or
without prompted text, with or without any suggestions at all).  The
extra round trip simplifies the logic to such a great extend that it's
worth it."

- We arrange that:
   - for custom search engines, or
   - for other searches where there is at least one match
  that match is at the top of the list (relevancy 1).

This top suggestion will the suggestion which will be used to popuplated
the promted text in the vomnibar.  If we arrange that it's at the top of
the list, then it is also the text that we get in the vomnibar if we hit
<Tab>.

This leaves us in the position where:

   - If the user wants just the text they've typed, then they hit
     <Enter>.

   - If they want all of the text in the input (including the prompted
     text), then they hit <Tab>, <Enter>.  This is a very natural UX.
     It feels like <Tab> is filling in the prompted text, although all
     it's really doing is choosing a suggestion (the first one), as it
     always has done.

There is one small catch. We need to avoid a clash with the domain
completer, which also likes to force its suggestion to the top of the
list.  There's a test for that case.  Basically, we can apply this trick
if it's a custom search, or if the user has finished typing the first
query term."

Previously, we removed the selection on exiting visual mode.  This

default caret position selected by caret mode is better than the last
text selected by the user in either caret mode or visual mode."

This changes vomnibar commands to activate not in the current frame, but
in window.top.  Consequently, the vomnibar always appears in the same
position, and we don't get odd looking vomnibars in small frames.

Apart from the better UX, this seems to be the right thing to do.
Vomnibar commands apply to tabs (not frames).

Currently incomplete:

- On exit, the focus is not returned to the frame which originally
  had the focus.  (It's returned to window.top).

- The vomnibar can lose the focus and not hide itself for various
  frame/click combinations."

to one frame.

Here's what can go wrong...

On gmail, open the hangouts frame.  Add an exclusion rule sepcific to
the hangouts frame.  Save it.  The update is propagated only to the main
frame.  The new exclusion rule is not in effect in the hangouts frame.
That's wierd and obviously wrong.

In this commit, every frame receiving the getActiveState request also
calls checkIfEnabledForUrl to ensure that any new exclusion-rule state
is propagated.  This is overkill, to some extent.  We should really move
settings to chrome.storage and have each frame check locally for changes

- because this is the URL which will affect the current frame (without

This only effects link hints with ""Use the link's name and numbers for

We have been matching the *entire text content* of each link-hint

With two (or more) hints, and with one of the elements a descendent of
the other, we have been using the entire text content of the outer node
(which includes the text content of the inner node).  This leads to odd
situations where the inner element cannot be selected just by typing its
text, because its text is a substring of the outer element's text.

For example, on Google calendar, the ""Today"" button shows up as two
hints, one inside the other.  Typing ""today"" never disambiguates the
hint.  You always have to hit enter.

There's another nasty example on feedly, where an outer container is
clickable, but its text contains all of the (many) texts of the (many)
contained links.  So the hint always has to be selected manually.

Here, when generating the text for an element, we exclude the texts from
any descendent node which has already been considered."

I'm seeing a strange scrolling bug on some pages, for example, here:
http://www.steephill.tv/tour-of-qatar/.

Background:
   When we scroll, we first have to decide which element to scroll.
   Because of a chrome bug, we do this by testing candidate elements:
   scroll the element up by one px, then back down again.  If it moved,
   then it's scrollable, and it's the element we should scroll.

Bug:
   In some cases, the micro-scroll-up succeeds, but the subsequent
   micro-scroll-down fails.  It's not clear how this could happen.  It
   may be a chrome bug.  In any case, as a result, we conclude that the
   element is not scrollable, and proceed to the next candidate.  We end
   up finding no scrollable element, and j/k scrolling is broken.  If
   you press-and-hold ""j"" or ""k"", you can see the repeated
   micro-scroll-ups.

Problem:
   I can't reproduce this in a clean chrome account.  I only see it in
   my live chrome instance.  I've tried disabling all extensions, but
   the problem persists.  So there's something else at play, but I
   haven't yet been able to track it down.

Solution:
   This commit is a temporary workaround.  We just default to scrolling
   document.body if we can't find anything else to scroll.  Most of the
   time, that's the right thing to do.  And it's what we would have done
   prior to implementing smooth scrolling.  Nevertheless, it isn't a
   great solution...

Notes:
   It's possible that this is related to #1117.  However, users there
   have reported *not* seeing the micro-scrolls.  So probably not.

   I'm not posting this as a PR, because I can't reliably reproduce the
   bug.  However, the fix pretty much does what we did before smooth
   scrolling, it's almost certainly safe.  So I'm just pushing this

In #1389/c52c0ea57f86c1c5a132819fe85e763db84ce712 we added descriptions
to search engines. We (I) omitted to realise that the ""type"" of a
selection (in particular, the constant ""search"") is also used to
determine whether the suggestion is automatically selected by the
vomnibar.

This fixes that, such that custom search engines with descriptions are
now automatically selected in the vomnibar."

The old implementation:
- Wasn't actually checking whether handlers had been removed before
  calling them.
- Could end up calling the same handler twice (if a handler was removed
  further down the stack, and the stack elements moved due the resulting
  splice.

Solution:
- Mark elements as removed and check.  Set their ids to null.
- Don't splice stack.

Also, optimisation:
- Removing the element at the top of the stack is still O(1).
- In Modes, reverse handlers before removing (so, more likely to hit the
  optimisation above).

For the record, the stable stack length at the moment seems to be about
10-12 elements."

 do the extra check.  This, hopefully, means that we don't suddenly find
 ourselves dropping into insert mode just because somebody reorders the

Changes:
   - Added caption ""Miscellaneous toggles"" to visually separate the
     link-hints checkbox from the others.
   - Made the text for the two link-hint character sets the same.
   - The ""Show advanced options"" link now spans two columns, so it does
     not affect its column's width, so the layout doesn't change when
     the options below the fold are expanded.
   - Added a fixed footer containing the help text and the save button.
   - The text of the save button now changes when it is enabled.
     (I sometimes find it hard to tell whether its been activated or
     not.)
   - Control-Enter anywhere on the page saves all options.
   - Aligned the entire options table left, instead of centered.  This
     is the chrome style.  However, it also makes it easier to get the
     alignment right between main table and the footer.
   - Change width of main wrapper such that it actually matches the
     table's width.  This aligns the right edge of the bar under the
     title with the right edge of the second column of the table."

This is designed to address several issues:

* `<input type=""range"" />` elements don't respond well to the simulated
click; they always reset their value to the minimum.
* The lack of `mouseup` event from the simulated click makes
`<input type=""range />` elements slide when the mouse is moved.
* HTML5 adds a large number of text-based `<input>`s that should be focused
like the `type=""text""` case, for consistency. (Using a blacklist halves
the number of types we have to list.)
* An `<input>` with a `type` the browser doesn't support is rendered as
a `type=""text""`, so a blacklist ensures that the focusing action is
consistent on all elements behaving as `type=""text""`."

* The `window` object receives key events before the `document` object,
and so any event listeners on `window` get priority. This commit
switches from binding `keydown`, `keypress`, `keyup` on `document` to
on `window`.
* We were using `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent other event
listeners from firing if we had handled an event. This stopped the event
from propagating to other elements/objects and triggering their event
listeners, but didn't block event listeners registered on the same
object as ours. Switching to `event.stopImmediatePropagation()` ensures
that our event listener is the last to run for the event.

Fixing these issues allows Vimium to regain control over key events in
Google Groups (eg. the [vimium-dev
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/vimium-dev))."

Fix:
  - Bookmark titles, in particular, tend to contain capital letters.

This interacts with these lines from settings.coffee:

    don't store the value if it is equal to the default, so we can change the defaults in the future
    if (value == @defaults[key])
      @clear(key)

If the default value is numeric, then this test NEVER succeeds (because
""=="" is compiled to ""==="", and the types don't match).

So, scrollStepSize is stored in localStorage even if it has its default
value.  Which obviates the intention of the line quoted above."

The purpose of this refactor is to simplify the contract so it's easier
to modify, and to make some substantial usability improvements.

One of the key differences is that matching is no longer fuzzy. If you
want to search more than one term, separate them by spaces. This matches
the behavior in Firefox.

While fuzzy matching is a nice experience for a limited set of known
items (like files in the current project), it doesn't work well for
a huge messy collection, like URLs in your history. The query ""hello""
will match random stuff from your google search results for instance,

Problem:
When bookmark completion is aborted using <ESC> key, the
completion dialog is faded out, zero opacity. This leaves
an invisible dialog hovering over the current page's content.
Any thing under the invisible dialog cannot get mouse focus,
including the links.

Solution:
After fading out the dialog, also hide it by its CSS display
property."

The motivation behind this change is that scrolling a page is far more common than
closing a tab, and so those actions should be on a hotkey which doesn't require a modifier.
Once you get used to scrolling without hitting ctrl, you won't be able to go back.

For existing users, this change also adds a custom mapping for them in their preferences to preserve
the old behavior as they upgrade from 1.21 to 1.22."

Only the focused frame will act on key commands.

On some sites (such as Gmail), the main frame is already focused, so
commands just work.

For other sites, focusing the desired frame may be necessary, which can
be done with the Tab key (not optimal) or by clicking with the mouse
(even less optimal).

An additional command to cycle through frames is desirable, which will
likely come in a future commit."
