Some Android C2DM Testing performed, messages should be working for
Android now!  I also added a Client library for Mono for Android apps
(that helps make registering for C2DM more simple, as well as handling
incoming notifications), and a client sample app for Mono for Android to
show you how to deal with c2dm in your android app.

There's a MonoTouch client sample as well (there's really not a client
library needed for monotouch since it's pretty simple code).

Finally, fixed some issues with the APNS Enhanced format error feedback.
Long story short we have to wait after sending each message to see if an
error returns or not (since apple never returns a success), otherwise we
may send messages after a bad message while waiting for apple's
response, that apple will discard and not tell us about, before it
closes the connection due to the first message being bad... Lame, but
necessary!"
Redth,2012-06-18 16:45:05,https://api.github.com/repos/Redth/PushSharp/git/commits/88270de8951483d04790e6901cf811d860d54456,88270de8951483d04790e6901cf811d860d54456,"Fixed APN Enhanced format error detection

The APNS Enhanced format returns a response if a notification failed,
but then it also closes the connection.  This allows for a possibility
of sending one notification, then sending a second one immediately
after, and then getting notified that the first one failed.  What
happens in this case is that the second one looks like it's been sent to
us, but apple closes the stream after the second one was sent, without
acknowledging that it failed or wasn't sent.  This means we have to wait
for possible errors from each message on the connection before sending
the next.  This sucks, and means an added 250 ms delay to sending each
message.  This also means that to speed up message delivery, more
Notification Channels are needed to scale across connections/threads.
Unavoidable if the Enhanced format is to be used (which provides the
ability to expire notifications as well as error reporting)."
