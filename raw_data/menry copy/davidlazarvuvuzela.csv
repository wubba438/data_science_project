been acked soon), but resetting lastOut caused message 2 to be sent again.

The new behavior is to continue in the looping order of outstanding
messages.  In steady-state with no message loss, this should result in
2x higher throughput by avoiding stuttering."

The coordinator now starts multiple rounds in parallel and relies on the
round's end time to schedule the rounds. This allows the coordinator to
prep the mixers and clients for a round well in advance of clients
submitting their onions. We also avoid fetching the latest config every
round, and instead fetch it every minute. This change also combines the
MixRound and NewRound messages to avoid an unnecessary round-trip. As a
result, clients will need to be updated before reconnecting to the Convo
service.

Overall, this commit significantly improves the end-to-end latency of
the convo protocol. However, there are several new knobs in this design
that will be tweaked as we get experience with it in production."

The idea is to use a keywheel (like in Alpenhorn's dialing protocol) to
achieve forward secrecy for convo messages. Previously, the dialing
protocol was used to agree on a session key that was fixed for the
duration of the conversation. Now the session key is rotated every convo
round via a keywheel. However, to bootstrap the keywheel, users need to
agree on the convo round that the initial session key corresponds to.

One naive solution is to use the latest convo round rounded down to the
nearest multiple of 1000. This works most of the time, except when a
call is sent near a rounding boundary (then the sender might think the
keywheel starts at round x, while the receiver thinks it starts at
x+1000).

Our solution is to use dialing intents to indicate which side of the
rounding boundary the sender intends to use. We use two intents: 0 means
that the rounded down convo round is even, and 1 means that it is odd.
Assuming the sender's and receiver's convo rounds are loosely synced,
then this is sufficient for them to agree on a convo round. The new
roundSyncer type implements this logic.

Fixes #3."

The GUI client now supports multiple concurrent conversations. There can
be at most 5 active conversations. The client will generate cover
traffic if there are fewer than 5 active conversations.

The /call command is used to activate a conversation and invokes
Alpenhorn's dialing protocol. The /hangup command ends a conversation
and frees up slot to activate other conversations. If the client
receives a call but is at the limit of active convos, then the client
will hold the call. The user can answer a held call using the /answer
command.

Each conversation now has its own window (or view as gocui calls it).
Users can create (or jump to) a conversation window with the /w command
and close a window with /wc. Like in irssi, each window has a number and
users can move between windows with Alt-{1,2,3,...}. The status bar now
features a menu bar that signals the currently focused window and any
windows with unread messages. The first window (window 1) is the main
window and is used for non-convo-specific messages like friend requests.
In code, this window is a special case since it does not map to a
Conversation value.

The concurrency in the GUI client is a bit of a mess. For example, there
are now two ways to write to a window, Printf and PrintfSync, depending
on which Go routine the call is made from. Also, having a mutex per
conversation adds complexity and has been a source of deadlocks. The
deadlock package has been useful in debugging deadlocks:

Previously, a ConvoHandler represented a single conversation that could
be switched in and out of the client. Now there is just one ConvoHandler
provided to the client when it is created. The new ConvoHandler supports
multiple messages per round, but it is up to the handler to determine
how these map to conversations. The ConvoHandler should create the same
number of dead drop messages each round, but the client does not enforce
this. In that sense, the client is a low-level interface to the convo
protocol.

The GUI client will be updated in a followup commit."

a574a6951dc5db0a911e58300ba745c2385834cf  all: separate config server from coordinator

From Vuvuzela's perspective, the most notable change is how the client
is bootstrapped. Now, instead of having the user provide the initial
add-friend, dialing, and convo configs, the vuvuzela-keygen command
fetches the latest configs from the config server. Cautious users should
verify the configs (especially the list of guardian keys) before
continuing to use the client."

This commit syncs the client with recent changes to the coordinator and
mixnet. The client now handles config updates sent by the coordinator
via the newround message. Config updates need to be persisted for
security, so now the client has persistent state.

Previously, the Client type was part of the vuvuvzela-client package.
Now, the vuvuzela-keygen command also needs access to the Client type
so that it can bootstrap the client with an initial convo config. This
commit moves the Client to its own package so that both commands can
use it."

The coordinator now broadcasts a NewRound message at the start of every
round to let clients know the configuration for that round. Configs are
managed by an underlying config.Server that is loaded from the
ConfigServerPersistPath. The coordinator still has its own persistent
state to keep track of the last round but its format has changed. The
init process is also revamped to match the Alpenhorn coordinator -- both
coordinators can be bootstrapped from the same bootstrap config file.
In the future, we may merge the two coordinators to reduce code
duplication.

This commit brings the coordinator in sync with the previous mixnet
commit. Also, the HTTP routes have changed and clients must now connect
to the coordinator over HTTPS (edTLS).

This commit is based on commits to Alpenhorn:

44d2d99fcd3b8eb73e2d0dfb946cc66aef5f8a4a  coordinator: dynamically configure clients
7a0913486971623216ed5946bf171fc1326ac459  coordinator: use the new config server

Those commits give a more detailed explanation of these changes and also
talk about issues related to freshness of the configs.

The client will be updated in the next commit."
davidlazar,2017-09-22 15:44:16,https://api.github.com/repos/vuvuzela/vuvuzela/git/commits/7e37b489b958e1b809d0ac3331438277dafcc04f,7e37b489b958e1b809d0ac3331438277dafcc04f,"mixnet: switch to gRPC and make mix chains dynamic

The switch to gRPC is motivated by needing more granular authentication
than is provided by vrpc to support dynamic mix chains. From the mixnet
server's perspective, the mix chain is now specified by the coordinator
and can change from round to round. From the client's perspective, the
mix chain is specified in a configuration (the convo.ConvoConfig type)
that is signed by the guardians of the system and broadcast to the
clients at the start of every round. This ensures the coordinator can
not trick users into using a malicious chain and gives guardians the
flexibility to add and remove servers in the chain.

This commit also makes the mixnet server more generic via the MixService
interface. One server can provide multiple mix services. Vuvuzela's
conversation protocol is provided by the ""Convo"" mix service (whose
implementation is now in the convo package). This also adds a test to
the mixnet package that uses a mock mix server.

This commit is based on commits to Alpenhorn:

b295f62039f6fd917d61044a3c6ada6052cbf143  mixnet: switch to gRPC for RPCs
b403340364b3d87ecff37c91a00a1f56b698cb71  mixnet: make mix chains dynamic
ab104db9199bfb86bdc6fc98fb8c45b456c2e55d  config: use json for user-facing signed configs

Those commits (and others in the Alpenhorn history) go into more detail
about dynamic configuration and the motivation behind these changes. We
note a few differences here:

* We named the protobufs package ""convopb"" instead of ""mixnetpb"" to
avoid gRPC conflicts with Alpenhorn.

* We have not updated Vuvuzela to use the new logging package provided
by Alpenhorn.

* We have not extensively benchmarked the new gRPC-based implementation,
but we don't expect that gRPC will get in the way of performance.

The coordinator and client will be updated in upcoming commits."
