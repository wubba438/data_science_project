Fork-before-snapshotting is fundamentally incompatible with newer V8

fork().  Then, when creating the snapshot, V8 tries to sync up with
a thread that no longer exists and deadlocks.

Another issue is that forking breaks the comparison view in DevTools
because the heap object IDs don't match up.  V8 updates them after
creating the snapshot but those changes don't make it back to the
parent process.

A bug in libuv makes it call `waitpid(-1)` before node-heapdump gets
a chance to call `waitpid(pid)` and, as a result, libuv consumes the
exit event of the process that node-heapdump forked off.

It looks like the bug is not fixable in libuv v0.10 without undue effort
so it probably won't get addressed.  (Libuv master is unaffected as a
side effect of commit joyent/libuv@5c00a0e.)

Not all is lost, however: ECHILD means there is no child process with
that pid so we know for sure that it's safe to stop our signal watcher.

Fixes #22."

Makes it possible for multiple SIGUSR2 handlers to coexist peacefully.
Consider this snippet:

    var heapdump = require('heapdump');
    process.on('SIGUSR2', function() {
      // ...
    });

Before this commit, a snippet like the one below would stop heapdump
from working because the event listener overrides the signal handler
that heapdump installs.

This change makes node-heapdump incompatible with node.js <= 0.8 as it
uses a libuv API that is only available in node.js >= 0.10.

Fixes #13."
