'extend', when compiled to js, was returning an array of

This broke the options sent to setCookie, because the 'expires'

so the cookie expiration field was never set as
options.expires.toGMTString().

As a result, the abbaVariant and abbaPersistComplete cookies
incorrectly had no expiration date or a received a default expiration
from the browser, rather than the 600 day expiration specified
in the code."
