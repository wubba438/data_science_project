Unfortunately, this got a big out of control while attempting
to get suspend / resume working properly. This commits contains
several (high-related) items that are difficult to split up:

* Fix the interface used for synchronized device state to
  the underlying VM. This means instead of a Sync() call, we
  now have formal Load() and Save() methods which will Load()
  the device state into the VM, and pull out the state from
  within the VM respectively.

* Add a device Pause() functionality. Because we need to ensure
  that devices are not actively changing state when we serialize
  state, we need to add a Pause() and Unpause() hook to the model
  similar to the Vcpu state. This also requires that goroutines
  that are using the underlying device call appropriate Acquire()
  and Release() methods when they are mutating the state. (These
  should not block, and should only be held when the device is
  actively changing).

  You don't need to worry about this for standard Read(), Write()
  methods, only for additional goroutines that you may launch.

  These pause methods are exposed via the control plane, and a
  paused flag is added to the command line for development.

  (It's useful to start a VM in a paused state).

* Add new KVM state & devices (like the FPU state) that were not
  properly being accounted for before.

* Fixes for small serialization errors encountered during development.

  Including:

  * Invalid refs serialized for plan9 state.
