Use goto_line instead which handles that properly. If focused_line is

On a slow network connection, the editor can become completely unresponsive for long periods. These changes cache the result for a single call to git_root() for 5 seconds. The effect is that git_root() only traverses the directory tree for a given leaf directory once whenever Sublime needs to check if all of the commands are active (instead of 38 times). The cache time is kept short to allow for realtime changes in git_root()'s results (if the user creates a repo, for example)."

the user was in when he/she called `git blame`. This way, the user will be
looking at the blame lines that are relevant to what he/she was interested in
when calling `git blame`.

Note that if the user has word_wrap turned on, and the lines in the blame buffer
are longer (and wrap more) than the lines in the original buffer, then the
scrolled-to position in the blame buffer may be slightly above the position
in the original file. This is because the position is calculated by the offset
from the top of the file, not by the number of lines of text."

Fun discovery: if you switch tabs while a command is working,
self.view.window() is None. (Admittedly this is a consequence
of my deciding to do async command processing... but, hey,
got to live with that now.)
I did try tracking the window used at the start of the command
and using it instead of view.window() later, but that results
panels on a non-visible window, which is especially useless in
the case of the quick panel.
So, this is not necessarily ideal, but it does work."
