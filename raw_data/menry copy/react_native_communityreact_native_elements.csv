Since https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/commit/e2795821fa85bbce48282b9c92d2260658d5c35e the Image component supports nesting children being based on ImageBackground. This meant however that children of the Image would not be visible until the image loaded which is incorrect behaviour.

This commit fixes this, allowing children to be visible while the image loads in the background. Also instead of using the ImageBackground component from react native, we implement our own based on [the source](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Image/ImageBackground.js). This is so we can place the animated placeholder between the content and the image.

e.g (background -> animated placeholder -> our content)

Also makes some small tweaks to Tile and FeaturedTile so that they display correctly with the new changes to Image.

Since Tile, Avatar, and Card now use RNE Image, the docs and types have been updated to reflect."

The search bar only sets the isEmpty state in the constructor and in the `onChangeText` function.

There are a few known scenarios where the opencollective postinstall npm script can cause things to break further down the pipeline - a few being 'certain build/CI environments', 'script permission issues' and 'offline installs'.... 

Arguably, displaying a banner soliciting funding shouldn't disrupt the development or build processes of projects leveraging libraries that are optionally, and non-functionally, using opencollective.

Ultimately, at the heart of the failure, is a non 0 exit code being returned in the cases that opencollective fails to properly execute. 

To prevent this non-zero exit code failure so that subsequent npm processes aren't disrupted as a result of non-functional dependency issues, a ""|| exit 0"" should be added to the postinstall npm script.

There are many discussions about this issue and workaround - here are a few:

While using ThemeProvider, some errors would be shown for some
components for arrays not having keys. This was due to the merge
algorithm in lodash.merge which happens to affect react's keys.

Switching to deepmerge instead of lodash.merge does not have this
issue but maintains expected behaviour.

`ListItem` props `chevron` and `checkmark` [are rendered](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/blob/master/src/list/ListItem.js#L213):

```js
{renderNode(Icon, checkmark, checkmarkDefaultProps(theme))}
{renderNode(Icon, chevron, chevronDefaultProps)}
```

Using the [`renderNode` helper](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/blob/master/src/helpers/renderNode.js), which includes the option of a `ReactElement`:

```js
const renderNode = (Component, content, defaultProps) => {

    return null;
  }
  if (React.isValidElement(content)) {
    return content;

[The docs](https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/docs/image.html) are accurate about the usage of this `PlaceholderContent` prop:

```js
<Image
  source={{ uri: image }}
  style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}
  PlaceholderContent={<ActivityIndicator />}
/>
```

i.e. you provide a `ReactElement`, not a `ComponentType` as specified in the TypeScript definitions here.

[Examining the source](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/blob/master/src/image/Image.js#L69) shows that it's used as a `ReactElement` too (i.e. rendered directly) rather than a Component:

```js
>
  {PlaceholderContent}
</Animated.View>
```"

* Add to SocialIcon

I wanted an email icon for the SocialIcon element and while looking around FontAwesome, several other missing possibilities were found.

* Change reddit color

Matchs official iconography beter.

* Wrong color for envelope

Forgot that the icon itself was white and the color was the background when entering the color for the envelope.

* Trying different snapchat icon

Snapchat puts a border around the ghost for a reason.  I’m looking at other icons, but may remove it entirely.

* Removing Snapchat

Without significant change, Snapchat will not look good.  The white on yellow doesn’t have enough contrast.

* Flickr icon too complex

The Flickr icon is too complex for this scheme as well.  There isn’t enough contrast, and no ability to make the circles differing colors.

* Added new icons to docs

Added the new SocialIcon types into the docs

* Alphabetized SocialIcon typs in docs

* Corrected envelope property

At first I used envelope-o but decided on just envelope and didn’t remove the special property notation.

* Small typo in docs

Missed a space before envelope

* Demo project shows all social icons

All social icons currently supported were added to the Social Icons card in the demo app."
