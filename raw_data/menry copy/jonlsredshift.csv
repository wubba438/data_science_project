- This allows the preserve option to be implemented as a
  command-line switch (-P). This switch _disables_ the preservation
  of existing gamma ramps. Having a command-line switch makes it
  easier to use directly with manual or one-shot mode.
- The preserve options is on by default, so continual mode as well
  as other modes will default to applying the color adjustment
  on top of the current gamma ramps.
- Preserve is always disabled in reset mode so resetting works

applied anytime the change in color temperature, brightness or

is applied if the location provider suddenly updates to a new

up the computer from sleep. An easing function is applied to the
fade to make it more pleasant."

Previously only one CRTC could be set in the configuration file for
redshifting when XRandR mechanism was being used. That is fine for
a setup with two displays but breaks when three or more displays
are in use and one of those shouldn't be redshifted (e.g. two
computer displays and one TV connected to the computer).

The config value 'crtc' for method xrandr can now be entered as
comma separated list of multiple CRTCs. All CRTCs in the list will
be redshifted while all those not in the list will not be touched."

This change adds the preserve option to the quartz method which makes it
base the temperature adjustments on the existing gamma ramps when set. This
requires that the existing gamma ramps are saved at start-up which this
commit also adds.

One drawback is that the list of displays is enumerated at start-up now which
means that Redshift will likely not affect displays that are connected after
start-up. This could be fixed in the future by listening to reconfiguration
events."
