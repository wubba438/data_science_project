This demo presentation is written entirely in Markdown, as provided
by the combination of the extras plugin, and extras/markdown/markdown.js

The idea for using Markdown instead of HTML came from users who felt that
sometimes when you just need to quickly toss together some slides, using
Markdown is faster than HTML. Same approach is also familiar to Hovercraft
users, where RST is converted to a traditional HTML based impress.js presentation.

Unlike Hovercraft, using Markdown.js allows you to write Markdown directly into
your html file that is the presentation. It is converted in the browser, and no
separate command line tool is necessary. As a result you can also mix and match:
some slides can be HTML (when needed) and some in Markdown."

This commit adds a generic mouse-timeout plugin. (Same code was

Although this implementation is different and more generic, the

impress#536

The functionality is simple:

After 3 seconds of mouse inactivity, add the css class
`body.impress-mouse-timeout`. On `mousemove`, `click` or `touch`, remove the
class.

A user will then use (or not) his own CSS to hide whatever he wants to hide

It turns out in CSS 3D, the order in which you specify for example
the rotateX(), rotateY() and rotateZ() transformations matter.
Each rotation is relative to the objects then-current position.
Impress.js being hardwired to always do rotateX->rotateY->rotateZ
was therefore limiting, and in fact there are some positions that
can never be reached with an xyz order. The new data-rotate-order=""""
attribute allows to specify the order as a permutation of the 3
letters x, y, z, thus relaxing this limitation.

- Libraries are under src/lib/
- Added to build.js as usual, before plugins.
- See src/lib/README.md for details

gc library implements a ""garbage collector"" library, which allows
both the core and plugins to store elements and listeners to a list,
and when impress().lib.gc.teardown() is called, to have all of them
removed from the DOM. It also allows plugins to register their own
callback functions, which are called at teardown.

Commentary:

This work is based on copying the src/lib/gc.js from impressionist. While it was
useful, it turns out on the impress.js side there was much more a need to reset
attributes rather than delete elements. For now, this means lots of plugins do this
via their own lib.gc.addCallback() functions. Probably it would be nicer to add
some generic lib.gc.resetAttributes() functionality for this particular case.
I'll return to this in a future patch.
