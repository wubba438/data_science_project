Represent time (currentTime, timeLeft, totalTime) in milliseconds instead of Date objects. This simplifies working with timings from the API, for example in custom filters. Furthermore, this change fixes the (previously incorrect) values in the aria-value* attributes.

Other minor changes:
- Fix indent in controls.js.
- Simplify watches on scope variables related to times from the API.
- On video complete, scrubbar remains at 100%. This is in line with the currentTime, which also remains at 100% on video complete."
