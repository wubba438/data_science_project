* Run the prepare script of git dependencies even if NODE_ENV=production

When installing a git dependency with the `NODE_ENV` environment variable set to `production`, yarn did not run the `prepare` lifecycle script, because `config.production` would default to true, and then `wrapLifecycle` would skip `prepare`:

https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/b6569538de69e0ccd201f0a33f1f5b52f2656f5b/src/cli/commands/install.js#L1202-L1207

This is contrary to npm's behavior and the intent of `GitFetcher#fetchFromInstallAndPack`, which is to install the dependency with its devDependencies and run all the relevant lifecycle scripts (excluding `prepublish`), regardless of the configuration or environment settings of the parent install command.

Closes #7013

**Summary**

A more elaborate description is available in #7013. In short, ensuring scripts are ran in the expected environment can deter hard to diagnose bugs.

**Test plan**

Given a `node` engine requirement that doesn‚Äôt match the current environment:

```
$ cat package.json | grep -i1 '""node""'
  ""engines"": {
    ""node"": ""^10.13.0""
  },

$ nvm use 8
Now using node v8.12.0 (npm v6.4.1)
```

A script invocation will fail as follows:

```
$ node ~/Code/JavaScript/yarn/lib/cli/index.js run relay
yarn run v1.15.0-0
error @artsy/reaction@12.1.10: The engine ""node"" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ""^10.13.0"". Got ""8.12.0""
error Commands cannot run with an incompatible environment.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.
```

If need be, this can be overridden with the `--ignore-engines` flag:

```
$ node ~/Code/JavaScript/yarn/lib/cli/index.js run --ignore-engines relay
yarn run v1.15.0-0
$ relay-compiler --src ./src --schema data/schema.graphql --language typescript --artifactDirectory ./src/__generated__ --exclude '**/node_modules/**,**/__mocks__/**,**/__generated__/**'
‚ú®  Done in 2.22s.
```

Or, of course, making the environment match the requirements:

```
$ nvm use 10.13
Now using node v10.13.0 (npm v6.4.1)

$ node ~/Code/JavaScript/yarn/lib/cli/index.js run relay
yarn run v1.15.0-0
$ relay-compiler --src ./src --schema data/schema.graphql --language typescript --artifactDirectory ./src/__generated__ --exclude '**/node_modules/**,**/__mocks__/**,**/__generated__/**'

### Summary
add Terminus to the list of supported terminal emulators for emoji

Since [Terminus](https://eugeny.github.io/terminus/) is also a xterm.js terminal emulator (same as [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)), and recently [it sets](https://github.com/Eugeny/terminus/commit/e246e22bfd51b1ee5e9e97a391ba6f51230070bb) `TERM_PROGRAM` to `Terminus` (like how Hyper sets it to `Hyper`), it is proper for Yarn to display Emojis also on Terminus."

**Summary**

Fix bug #7079 of `basicSemverOperatorRegex`. It doesn't match the range operator correctly if the dependency range is specified with `>=`. For example, when running `yarn upgrade --latest`, if a dependency is specified with `>=`, the matched result will be `>`, which is not correct. 

This is because the regular expression engine looks for alternations one-by-one. We can fix it by putting `>=` before `>`.

* fix(modules-folder): Fix --modules-folder handling in several places.

Fixes a few issues with the `--modules-folder` parameter.

The extraneous file check would always
also clean files from `node_modules`. This no longer happens, only the `--modules-folder` location
is checked.

The `yarn check` command used to always only check `node_modules`. Now it will check the
`--modules-folder` location instead.

When running a command or executing a lifecycle script, yarn
would build a `PATH` that included `node_modules/.bin` first, then add the `--modules-folder`'s
`/.bin` after, which would have led to the wrong binaries being executed.

* Don‚Äôt call `release` with an exit code

The `release` signature is incorrect, because its first argument is a callback function that will be called when the release is done. By attaching it to the `run()` promise however, release will be called with the exit code as argument. When the exit code is `1`, the code will crash. 

This is very rare, but we‚Äôre seeing this when calling yarn from another node process (and possibly killing it too soon):
```
<redacted>/node_modules/yarn/lib/cli.js:78119

     at options.fs.rmdir (<redacted>/node_modules/yarn/lib/cli.js:78119:9)
     at FSReqWrap.oncomplete (fs.js:141:20)
```

* Only resolve after releasing is done, improve type of `release`.

Note that this slightly violates the type of runEventuallyWithFile, as
the Promised resolved by the release callback might return an Error
object. But since this error was also not handled before, it‚Äôs out of
scope for the fix of this patch."

* fix(pnp): make sure that the package locator is...

... fetched with a trailing slash

I could not get P'n'P working on a project using `critical`[1] and
traced it down to a lookup of a package locator without a trailing
slash.

A `require('resolve').sync('fg-loadcss')` from `inline-critical`[2]
would fail to resolve as the `locatorsByLocations` lookup in `.pnp.js`
would be using a key without a trailing slash, i.e.:

```
""../../.cache/yarn/v4/npm-inline-critical-4.0.7-3ffba6a869f39215c8bb00ed2dd6b872e7f98adc/node_modules/inline-critical""
```

`findPackageLocator` is invoked with `location` parameter (notice no
trailing slash):

```
location = ""/home/zregvart/.cache/yarn/v4/npm-inline-critical-4.0.7-3ffba6a869f39215c8bb00ed2dd6b872e7f98adc/node_modules/inline-critical""
```

from `resolveToUnqualified` with parameters:

```
request = ""fg-loadcss/package.json""
issuer = ""/home/zregvart/.cache/yarn/v4/npm-inline-critical-4.0.7-3ffba6a869f39215c8bb00ed2dd6b872e7f98adc/node_modules/inline-critical""
```

All starting from `loadNodeModulesSync` in `resolve`'s `sync.js`[3]
that ends up having `absoluteStart` without the trailing slash.

Not sure if this is the most correct way of fixing this issue, by just
ensuring that the trailing slash needed for the lookup is added if
missing.

All tests from `yarn test` and from `packages/pkg-tests`
`yarn jest yarn.test.js` pass, so it seems like a start.

This is how to reproduce:

package.json:
```json
{
  ""name"": ""require-failure"",
  ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
  ""main"": ""index.js"",
  ""license"": ""MIT"",
  ""scripts"": {
    ""install"": ""node --require ./.pnp.js index.js""
  },
  ""devDependencies"": {
    ""critical"": ""^1.3.4""
  },
  ""installConfig"": {
    ""pnp"": true
  }
}
```

index.js:
```javascript
require('critical').generate({
  inline: true,
  html: '<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""site.css""></head><body><h1>Hello</h1></body></html>'
});
```

site.css:
```css
h1 { font-weight: bold; }
```

Not sure how to create a package test from that example (sorry).

The chocolately install has always been full of log spam due to an incorrectly written `/l*v` flag, but those logs are also unneeded since the output has no useful info so I just removed them (this can be reversed to just fix the flag if y'all really want it back).

This also removes the bad `nodejs-lts` nuget dependency added in #5925. It now has no dependency, and instead logs out to inform the user to install node if it's missing.

The last three tests in `__tests__/commands/publish.js` were regularly timing
out locally, yet they were doing fine on CI. They were apparently running in
interactive mode, and were waiting for user input after `publish` was called
(to set the next version number).

Setting `nonInteractive` to false by default in `__tests__/commands/_helpers`
ensures that all command tests run in non-interactive mode unless otherwise
specified. This prevents this problem from occuring again, at least among the
tests that use this helper.

Note that this change won't improve tests on CI, as this problem never
affected CI. The tests were running in non-interactive mode on CI
already due to an `isCi` check in `config.js`."

When `install`ing in a repo with a dependency that specifies `""flat:: true`, but without the `--flat` flag or `""flat"": true` in your own package.json, you get an error: `The package undefined@undefined requires a flat dependency graph. Add \`""flat"": true\` to your package.json and try again.`

This was occuring because the relevant error message, `flatGlobalError` was expecting two variables for interpolation: the package name and the package version.

This fix changes that to one variable (to be consistent with other uses) and passes the appropriate values in to the message."

* feat(audit): Initial addition of yarn audit command and --audit flag

Added ""yarn audit"" command which copies the behavior of ""npm audit"". Unline npm, yarn does not
automatically run ""audit"" during ""add/install/upgrade"" commands. Since this would cause an
additional network call, it broke all existing unit tests to add this feature and have it run
automatically. In the interest of getting an initial release in the hands of our users the
""add/install/upgrade"" commands accept a ""--audit"" flag that will enable the audit. If you want audit
to always execute, you can add ""--*.audit true"" to .yarnrc

* gzip the JSON sent to npm audit API to reduce payload

* fix audit test for gzip data

For some packages the NPM registry is incorrectly returning tarball
URLs that are not using HTTPS. For example:
`http://registry.npmjs.org/onetime/-/onetime-1.1.0.tgz`

Previously the `registry.npmjs.org` -> `registry.yarnpkg.com` tarball
URL normalisation was not occurring for these non-HTTPS URLs, causing
unwanted `http://registry.npmjs.org` references in `yarn.lock`.

Whilst the real fix needs to be made upstream:
https://npm.community/t/some-packages-have-dist-tarball-as-http-and-not-https/285

...this change prevents lockfile churn and insecure package downloads
over HTTP in the meantime.

The request-cache entry for `onetime` has been updated to the current
NPM registry response, which contains the bogus `tarball` URLs.

The Webpack config for the modern build was adjusted recently to add a loader,
which is used as a workaround for a bug introduced by a recent dependency
update. The legacy config needed the same update.

The Webpack config was also updated in superficial ways to follow
recommendations made for migrating from Webpack v1 to v2 (e.g. using
`module.rules` instead of `module.loaders`). These changes should have no
functional impact, and should make migrating to future versions of Webpack
easier.

Instead of checking for the existence of `v8-compile-cache.js`, just try to `require` it in a `try`/`catch`, using a full path. Also switched the `require` of `cli.js` to use the same pattern for consistency (plus it's a module resolution micro-optimization).

The test suite displays the following warning message when run:
```
jest-haste-map: @providesModule naming collision:
  Duplicate module name: yarn
  Paths: <repo directory>\dist\package.json collides with
    <repo directory>\package.json
```

This is because the Jest module system finds two copies of Yarn; the
primary package and the build output. This causes ambiguity when loading
`yarn` from a test, or a module that depends upon yarn.

Adding the build directory to `modulePathIgnorePatterns` prevents this
message. This means that if `yarn` is imported from within a test (which
it is not currently), the version found will be the primary package, not
the built version.

This seems acceptable. Currently, components of `yarn` are referenced by
filename rather than by package name, and they are all from the `src`
directory. The many cases where the built `yarn` is run in tests are all
done through a child process, where this change would not be applicable
anyway."

**Summary**

Jest 22.4.x mocks the process object without a proper stub for `process.mainModule`. In our
lifecycle code, we try to set `env.npm_execpath` when it is not defined by using
`process.mainModule.filename`. When running tests on AppVeyor, we run Jest directly, thus we don't
have `env.npm_execpath` set, triggering the `process.mainModule` code path which is also not set,
causing tests to fail.

AppVeyor builds should pass.

**Summary**
Add a case in `bin/yarn` to run `cygpath` on the yarn base dir if the environment is MSYS.

Automatic path translation happens differently, or perhaps conditionally, depending on whether msys detects the target binary is a native Win32 application or not. While bash from Git for Windows seems to treat `winpty` as a Win32 binary, the version of `winpty` which is compatible with MSYS2 does not trigger the path conversion.

**Test plan**
`yarn` executed from within bash within MSYS2 correct executes, instead of failing with a path
related error. `yarn` continues to execute correctly from within Git Bash.

**Summary**

this reverts most of #3395 992b5c9086406b57416e1b0c3c77bea894fc97f0 which appears only necessary to work around #3329 (requesting the yarn version with -v triggered install). As noted in #5839, `yarn -v` and `yarn check` no longer have `install` as a side effect and IMO, the original behavior where an empty lock file is generated as part of install is the correct behavior.

Many tools currently sniff for a yarn.lock file to determine if yarn is being used. It seems more consistent with `yarn import` which generates a lockfile even if the existing node_modules is empty.

**Summary**

1. Added node 10 to CircleCI
2. Fixed a test that was using the `net.createServer` method. This was having issues, likely because of this: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/20334 - it now uses a ""normal"" `http` server instead, serving the same purpose.
3. Changed the `readFirstAvailableStream` method in `util/fs.js`. I'm guessing this is related to the same issue as 2, but there have been quite some changes in `10` that might be causing this - so it's just a guess. Since this piece of code could be clearer and more conceise anyway, I opted to just change it. Now instead of relying on the stream `error` event to check if a file exists, it just explicitly checks it before starting the stream.
4. Upgraded `upath` from `1.0.2` to `1.0.5` which supports node 10 (found through its `engines` field when installing).
5. Upgraded Jest
6. Fixed a bug regarding replacing symlinks to non-existent targets on Windows
7. Removed a redundant test
8. Fixed two test cases that were failing frequently on macOS builds

**Summary**

A previous change removed the -c option that was passed to the shell, causing script like ""echo foo""
to fail if script-shell was set to bash. This change cleans up the way custom shell is specified,
passing the shell to node's child process spawner instead of trying to make it part of our command
string. Doing it this way seems to account for the previously required -c flag.

fixes #5699 

**Test plan**

No test was added because our tests for the `yarn run` command use a mocked `execute-lifecycle-script`. Plus these tests would get run on windows too, so making a test that specified a config of `script-shell bash` would fail if it was unmocked.

Can be tested manually by creating a `.yarnrc` that contains:

```
script-shell bash
```

and adding a script like:

```
  ""scripts"": {
    ""foo"": ""echo foo; echo bar; echo $SHELL""
  }
```

which should produce the output

```
$ yarn run foo

These are a few upgrades of dependencies in order to address issues on node 10 (in relation to: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5477)

*duplexify* *3.5.0* => *3.5.4* (https://github.com/mafintosh/duplexify/commit/00d08fa3f223e1c7d1c05e0350c236d1c4e32d09)

*natives* *1.1.0* => *1.1.3* (https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2162)

The last did not have to do with `new Buffer` but was something I personally encountered when using `gulp` for building in `node 10`. I don't know how common this is, but the fix is easy and within scope, so decided to include it.

**Summary**

Fixes #976.

This is a bug fix to the problem where lifecycle scripts that try to go interactive hang yarn installs with no indication as to why.

This sets stdin to /dev/null and, on unix-like systems, detaches the process from the terminal making it unable to read /dev/tty.

Previously with the spinner enabled was impossible to give input to an interactive script on stdin, because a pipe was kept open from the main yarn process to the child process but it was never written to.  Interactive scripts could previously use /dev/tty on unix-likes to bypass this, however the fact that scripts are run in parallel means that if two scripts go interactive in this manner that they'll step on each other.

This does not change the behavior if the spinner is disabled. Also added a simple integration test with a blocking install script that times out without the patch.

**Test plan**

Try running `yarn add semantic-ui`. Hangs without the patch, fails with the patch."

Currently, it's possible (although undocumented) to automatically bump the version by running something like `yarn version --loose-semver --new-version minor`.

I've added the ability to automatically increment the version with one of the flags: `--major`, `--minor`, or `--patch`. This will also satisfy feature request #5367.

**Summary**

Last year I contributed the ability to disable commit hooks when versioning with npm (See [this commit](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2dec601c6d5a576751d50efbcf76eaef4deff31e#diff-2992be03e25e9f38300b7ce175e4f4e1)). It makes sense to add the same functionality to yarn.

The original motivation for this feature is based on a pre-commit hook that included linting and testing a large code base, taking ~20 seconds to run. When that hook is run on the preceding commits, it's unnecessary and time-taking to do so on versioning. Because of that, it's nice to have the option to disable that git hook.

fixes #4840

**Summary**

Previously the upgrade command would call add with the list of packages
to upgrade to. No ""--dev""
flag would be carried over and this list would contain all dependencies.
As a result, Add would
report a warning `{package} is already in ""devDependencies"". Please
remove existing entry first
before adding it to ""dependencies"".`

I am using the existing `config.commandName` to decide whether or not to
display the warning.

I also updated the jest snapshots, because I was tired of the warning
about 40-some obsolete snapshots, so the snapshot changes here aren't
relevant to the functionality, just cleaning up.

**Test plan**

Added regression test in `__tests__/commands/upgrade.js`.

Upgrade tests now set `config.commandName` which is an existing
property, but is not normally set by tests. I wanted to set it for all
tests in `_helpers.js` but we don't actually specify the command we are
going to test when we build a test runner.

**Summary**

Closes #5054, closes #4876, closes #5152.

Currently when running `yarn --ignore-optional` required dependencies can be marked as optional because they exist in the tree of `optionalDependencies` of one of the dependencies (but it's required by some other non-optional dependency).

For example: `once` depends on `wrappy`, but `wrappy` is also in the chain from `fsevents` (`glob` -> `inflight` -> `wrappy`) which is an optional dependency of `chokidar`. So if the first `wrappy` comes from an ""optional chain"" when yarn processes it, it ends up being marked as `_reference.optional = true`, and the package hoister therefore doesn't mark it as required.

When running the released version of yarn with https://github.com/spalger/reproduce-issues/blob/master/yarn-ignores-non-optional-dependencies you'll see

```
~/dev/reproduce-issues/yarn-ignores-non-optional-dependencies
$ yarn --ignore-optional
yarn install v1.3.2-20171204.1856
[1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...

$ yarn check --verify-tree
yarn check v1.3.2-20171204.1856
error ""once#wrappy"" not installed
error An unexpected error occurred: ""Found 1 errors."".
```

This fix checks whether or not the parent is marked as required, and if so, marking the dependency as required _unless_ it's listed in the parent's `optionalDependencies`.

**Test plan**

I tested this implementation with both https://github.com/spalger/reproduce-issues/blob/master/yarn-ignores-non-optional-dependencies and https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4876, and in both cases `yarn check --verify-tree` succeeded after running `yarn --ignore-optional`.

Also added automated tests."

fixes #4984
fixes #5327

Summary

Previously the relative path to the script to run was being passed to the child_process function, plus the cwd was being set. This caused relative paths to be doubled.

For example if the current process.cwd() is /projects/sampleProject/subdir and you execute yarn --cwd .. run test then it would attempt to run the command

../node_modules/.bin/test

from

/projects/sampleProject

which is incorrect.

The fix here was to use path.resolve instead of .join to convert the script's location to an absolute path.

Test plan

Tested manually.

I tried to write a unit test for this, but under the current test framework an absolute dir was always passed to the script execution because config.cwd is always set to the absolute path for the test fixture.

Trying to set the config.cwd to a relative path causes tests to fail because they become relative to where yarn run test was executed (the root of the Yarn project).

**Summary**
Yarn already supports aliasing a scoped package with an unscoped package:
```bash
yarn add @goodforonefare/left-pad@npm:left-pad@1.2.0
```

This PR adds support for aliasing any package with a scoped package:
```bash
yarn add left-pad@npm:@goodforonefare/left-pad@1.2.0
```

Note: the only documentation I can find for this feature [is a tweet from Sebastian McKenzie](https://twitter.com/sebmck/status/873958247304232961?lang=en).

**Test plan**
* `cd` to a yarn-managed repo
* Add a scoped alias for `left-pad`:
  * `yarn add left-pad@npm:@goodforonefare/left-pad`
* Verify that `left-pad` calls append my username to inputs:

* fix(install): use node-gyp from homebrew npm

**Summary**

With this yarn will be able to discover and use the node-gyp from the
homebrew installed npm on macOS instead of falling back to globally
installing node-gyp every time a native addon needs to be compiled from
source.

Homebrew installs a clean copy of npm inside a libexec folder together
with node.
Previously yarn didn't look there when trying to locate node-gyp and the
globally install node-gyp fallback would be used every time when
building native addons with a yarn version from homebrew.
This PR adds the libexec path of node-gyp from homebrew to the node-gyp
search paths of yarn, making it possible to compile native addons using
the homebrew npm provided node-gyp with yarn without relying on this
fallback.

**Test plan**

This can't be tested outside a homebrew environment.

A way to manually test this on macOS, by installing a test build of this
PR with homebrew and trying to install a native addon with it, is
provided in the PR description.

* Add test for bug with conflicting bin link names

dependency rather than the direct one after install.

This test asserts that bin links from direct dependencies are installed.

* Do not overwrite existing bin links

The bin links are created in two passes during install. In the first
pass all direct dependencies for the installing module and transient
dependencies are created in their respective bin directories. In the
second pass top level bin links are created for all modules, including
transient dependencies.

This patch makes sure the second pass doesn't overwrite links from the
first pass which fixes a problem where links from transient dependencies
could overwrite links from direct dependencies.

**Summary**

We had a tiered cache key setup for some reason (probably remnant of the pre-macOS builds config) which was breaking macOS builds when a new dependency was introduced due to common install was done on a Docker machine and cached with a key including the architecture. This patch changes that and ties everything to a single cache key.

**Summary**

When using artifactory as an internal npm registry in conjunction with scoped packages, yarn install was failing (about 50% of the time) with messages of the form
    
      Hashes don't match when extracting file
      ""https://artifactory.internal.site:443/artifactory/api/npm/external-mirror/@types/react/-/react-15.6.4.tgz"".

      ""da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709""
    
The problem was that yarn was writing both `@types/react-15.6.4.tgz` and `react-15.6.4.tgz` to the same location within the offline mirror due to making an assumption about no additional leading paths before the scope name in the URL -- an assumption which was true for registry.npmjs.org, but not for artifactory npm repositories.

**Test plan**

Added a new unit test."

**Summary**

Fixes #4978

Previously, there was logic in add command that [uses user-specified range out of the box](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/cli/commands/add.js#L71-L72), resulting in the issue above. For example, if the user ran `yarn add left-pad@1.0.0` the pattern parser skipped `--exact` or `--tilde flags`, as well as saved prefix config options.

This change updates it so that if the user specifies a valid numeric version, then these flags still have an effect. These cases don't cover `yarn add left-pad@~1.0.0` or `yarn add left-pad@^1.0.0` since I think the confusion only arises from when the user enters `exact` pattern (just the number).

**Test plan**

**Summary**

This adds the additional warning if there are no bin scripts or if there are no scripts available. If no scripts are available, scripts will not be listed.

I created this pull request when running `yarn run` without any scripts specified, yarn would try to ask the user to specify which script.

To view this feature in the CLI, run `yarn run` inside a project without any bin or scripts available.
For example:
```bash
$ yarn run
yarn run v1.3.2
error No command specified.
error There are no binary scripts available.
error There are no scripts specified inside package.json.
Done in 0.13s.

**Summary**

Fixes #4885. In #4761 I started always passing the proxy to the `request` library to prevent it from falling back to env vars HTTPS_PROXY and HTTP_PROXY. At the time I thought that Yarn would pick up these env vars through its config system and pass them down itself.

It turns out this was not true and caused #4885. Now handling an explicit `false` in the request-manager to allow it to override the `https_proxy` if set. Otherwise, resume allowing request library to pick up the env vars.

**Test plan**

This PR adds the workspace root

This is generally needed because #4730 ensures bin links in a workspace will be at the workspace root. With this PR, you can now `yarn run` commands in an individual package again.

2. The threshold to detect duplication is set to 30, which is the default value. Currently, it reports 9 possible duplicates for yarn codebase. This would be set according to the accuracy of detections.
3. The reporter shows all the code that are possibly duplicates of each other as _diffs_. Thus, the reports can be very verbose. There is an option for suppressing diffs longer than `n` lines in reports. That can be considered.

**Summary**

[config.js](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/389e02979a1ffe803ab95cbea1ad7b6bcdfa42a7/src/config.js#L336) determines if yarn runs in a production environment and sets a `production` config variable accordingly. The list command wants to know if it runs in a production environment and uses `isProduction()` to do so, which does look at environment variables, slightly different than the code in `config.js`, leading to inconsistencies in some corner cases. It should just use `config.production` instead.

`isProduction()` isn't used anywhere else and `config.production` should always be preferred, so I removed the whole function. I planned to adapt the tests of `isProduction()` for `config.production`, but the [existing tests](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/389e02979a1ffe803ab95cbea1ad7b6bcdfa42a7/__tests__/integration.js#L82) for `config.production` already cover all those cases.

**Test plan**
The existing tests for the `list` command still pass when they use `config.production`."

**Summary**

Use `boolifyWithDefault()` to determine if environment variable values are `true` or `false`. This ensures that all environment variables interpret the same values the same way.

This changes the behavior of `YARN_SILENT` and `YARN_IGNORE_PATH` if they have ""unexpected"" values, all nonempty stings beside `""0""` and `""false""` are now interpreted as `true`. For example `YARN_SILENT=hello` was interpreted as `false` before, now it is `true`. This makes some sense since those values are truthy in Javascript, but generally makes things more predictable if it works like that for all yarn environment variables.

`YARN_SILENT=true` was also interpreted as `false`. This now definitely makes more sense since it will be interpreted as `true`.

See also [#4811](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/4811#issuecomment-340830589).

**Summary**

Fixes #4778.

In this particular issue, the same pattern `babel-runtime@^6.26.0` was [defined in both devDependencies](https://github.com/kompot/yarn-frozen-lockfile-bug/blob/master/package.json#L80) and [resolutions field](https://github.com/kompot/yarn-frozen-lockfile-bug/blob/master/package.json#L130). Since resolutions feature was only intended for nested dependencies, it previously didn't take into account when the same exact pattern existed as a top level dependency. And it happens so that after the package resolver phase, [integrity checker looks at top level patterns](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/integrity-checker.js#L364-L367), so install failed.

The solution was to add top level raw patterns to resolutions map, and only remove them if they're transitive patterns

**Test plan**

Added a new test case in resolutions

Fixes #4735

Upgrade was calling outdated in a way that would not filter packages that did not need
an upgrade. The led to potential backdate of package if a beta version was in use. Yarn would
backdate to the ""older"" latest.

Summary

Some older upgrade code I had written had a code path to have getOutdatedPackages() return all packages, not just ones that were actually outdated. My belief had been that it wouldn't cause an issue because upgrading to the same version would just do nothing... but it turns out if you are on a beta version of a package, this would cause upgrade --latest to backdate you to the actual latest.

So for example if you were currently at beta 1.0.3-0 and the registry had latest 1.0.1 then yarn upgrade --latest would backdate you to 1.0.1.

This PR reinstates the filter that only returns versions if the current is less-than the latest, which would in the above example leave the user at 1.0.3-0

Use a repo like `https://github.com/edmorley/yarn-unmet-peerdependency-testcase` to have peer dependency
warnings and observe they now show the path for the package missing the peer dependency. This should
allow people to investigate these errors in an easier fashion.

```
warning ""neutrino-preset-airbnb-base > eslint-config-airbnb-base@12.0.2"" has unmet peer dependency ""eslint@^4.8.0"".
warning ""neutrino-preset-airbnb-base > eslint-plugin-import@2.7.0"" has unmet peer dependency ""eslint@2.x - 4.x"".

**Summary**

Fixes #4546. Previous behavior was that if `.npmrc` or `.yarnrc` contained and `http-proxy` but not an `https-proxy`, HTTPS requests would ""fall back"" to the `http-proxy`.

This is not always the desired behavior; See #4546 sometimes one protocol needs a proxy and the other does not.

This PR adds the ability to set the `https-proxy` to `false` which will cause Yarn to not use an HTTPS proxy (and not fall-back to the HTTP proxy). This allows the code to treat `undefined` as the setting not being specified (which will fall back to http-proxy) and `false` as the setting being specified, but set to false (which will not use a proxy).

**Test plan**

Tested manually on Windows with Fiddler.

Testing on Windows should be similar, but may require fancier escaping to get the arguments into yarn in the first place. (I don't have access to a Windows box to verify the exact procedure to follow, sorry‚Äîbut I did confirm that my automated tests succeed in AppVeyor.)"

**Summary**

This addresses some of the windows issues regarding running yarn in gitbash and friends envrionment.
with this fix I keep the behavior introduced 5 months ago in yarnpkg/yarn#3245, but try to do a better job detecting when to use winpty out of the box, in order make `piping` of output work with yarn.

Before this fix:
```shell
$ yarn --version
1.1.0
$ yarn --version | cat
1.1.0
$ yarn init
yarn init v1.1.0
error An unexpected error occurred: ""Can't answer a question unless a user TTY"".
info If you think this is a bug, please open a bug report with the information provided in ""D:\\workspace\\yarn\\yarn-error.log"".
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/init for documentation about this command.
```

Piping works for simple commands, but interactive commands only work with an environment set to something. This prohibits scripts/tools around yarn that uses pipe, which is quite common to do in an unix like environment, but theses tools cannot work in windows' unix like environment.

WinPTY seems to be the savior here, but we need to only run yarn through winpty when a tty actually needs to be allocated. 

Previous attempts to solve this problem like: 
- yarnpkg/yarn#2230
- yarnpkg/yarn#2243

Did not address the use cases of piping, so they essentially broke that behavior.
Then yarnpkg/yarn#3245 fixed that, but now you have to use `YARN_FORCE_WINPTY=1` environment variable in order for `yarn init` and `yarn upgrade-interactive` to work and that's alright, but if you export that variable then piping is broken yet again because the variable will also be set in the piped command, and we haven't solved any problem.

I suggest we keep the environment variable behavior but open up for better detection when to use winpty out of the box.

This fix detects if the winpty binary is in path, and only use it if stdin is in fact a TTY: `test -t 1`. 

**Test plan**

The output of running:
- `yarn init`
- `yarn upgrade-interactive`
- `yarn --version | cat`

Without having the `YARN_FORCE_WINPTY=1` environment variable set.

the hard Node 4+ check in the entry file since in that case,

warning is to signal that users may encounter unexpected errors
but are allowed to use Yarn if they wish. It also adds a new

**Summary**

Lockfile parser fails when the lockfile had Windows-style line
endings with an ""Invalid token"" error. This is default on Windows
and, say when editing the file using vim, it is not obvious or
trivial that the file endings are in Windows-style. This patch
makes the parser tolareate potential ""\r"" chars before ""\n"" while
keeping the existing parsing logic the same.

each request, which is quite sad at best. This patch introduces
the `dnscache` module which intercepts all DNS look ups and answers
them from an in-memory cache when possible. This applies to the
built-in `http` and `https` modules, used by `request`.

**Summary**

A combination of changes have caused `yarn upgrade-interactive` to exit with a promise rejection. 

In short, I believe it has always been a problem, but #3995 exposed it to the prompt. 

The child rejection inside of [upgrade-interactive](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/cli/commands/upgrade-interactive.js#L152) is fine, as it was handled by the `Promise.race` condition; however, rejecting at the parent level inside of [console-reporter](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/reporters/console/console-reporter.js#L458) causes[ loud-rejection](https://github.com/sindresorhus/loud-rejection) to handle this.

**Summary**
Fix for https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4357.

The issue is that when a dependency (dep A) defined in resolutions (includes dep A, dep B) depends on another resolution (dep B), then it expects to match its own nested dep B to the top level resolution dep B. So the first part of this fix is ""don't run resolutions map check when it's in flat mode"", which is what threw the invariant warning. Second part of the fix is that we still want that nested dependency (dep B) of a resolution (dep A) to be resolved correctly. `--flat` mode solves this by [collapsing all versions](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/cli/commands/install.js#L558) after the resolver is done. For resolutions, I'm adding a delay queue for requests with resolutions but no manifests found yet so that they will be resolved later.

**Summary**

The exotic `file-resolver` checks for `.` and `..`, but the regex is missing the escape on the `.`, so *any* two characters count as a file. This includes single-character scope names, like `@s/packagename`.

This issue was introduced in https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/4257.

I don't know of any single-character scopes in the public registry to use as reference, the way `left-pad-1.1.1.tgz` is mirrored in there. Could I just copy `leftpad-1.1.1.tgz` as `@s/leftpad-1.1.1.tgz` and use that?"

* Fix: Make sure global prefix folder is writeable when selecting it

**Summary**

Fixes #4320 and fixes #4323. We were using `fs.access` when selecting
the global prefix folder automatically which only checks for permissions
but not actual writeability. This caused issues on Heroku where one of
our first tries had the correct permissions but was on a read-only
file system.

**Test plan**

move the core of those tests for the newly added `fs.getFirstWriteableFolder`
method.

Fixes #4251. Follow up to #4088. Instead of just checking whether the
target is a valid directory, we now check if it contains a
`package.json` file too. This is still different from `npm`'s behavior.
Apparently, `npm` fetches the package info upfront to favor dist-tags
over directories but this comes at a distinct performance penalty and
makes static, deterministic resolution impossible so we are now
deprecating the implicit `file:` protocol in patterns. After a certain
point, we'll remove this code and will require everyone to use `file:`
or at least one of the following path identifiers: `./`, `../`. `/`.

**Summary**

We've added new field to the integrity file, `modulesFolders`, which will
be missing from the old versions. Since the code assumes this field is
always an array, it causes failures with old integrity files. This patch
fixes the issue by always providing some defaults.

**Summary**

Follow up to #3544. Currently, `yarn` happily keeps moving if it
detects merge conflicts and is able to resolve them in the lockfile.
That said it doesn't persist the resolution by saving the lockfile
to disk again. This patch ensures writing the lockfile if it is
""dirty"".

This patch also causes `yarn` to throw an error if there are merge
conflicts in the file and `--frozen-lockfile` option is true.

**Test plan**

files:

**Summary**

This PR prevents using `yarn add <pkg>` from within a workspace root folder, in order to prevent common mistakes where a package is added to the workspace root folder instead of being added to the right workspace (which, because of the node resolution algorithm, would be effectively invisible to the user).

If the user really wants to add a dependency to the workspace root folder, then we suggest them to use `yarn add <pkg> --dev` instead. This should be fine since the workspaces will probably only be used in development mode anyway. An alternative would be to introduce a new flag `--force` that would bypass this check, but I think the current heuristic is fine until we receive complaints.

**Test plan**

Added two tests."

the pattern is not a valid semver range and the matched local entity is a directory.

- Run `yarn install express`
- Observe that your console is properly cleared after `yarn`
  finishes and the last thing you see is the ""Done in X.YZs.""

**Summary**
Fixes: #3954.

Adds error handling for scripts that are failing with a signal such as `SIGBUS`, `SIGSEGV`, etc.

In current behavior, yarn checks the exit code of a script to show errors and fail the process. But certain errors make node child-processes to exit with a signal instead. (e.g. the case in #3954)

This fix adds support for handling exit signals from child processes and shows more informative error messages.

**Note:**  This implementation handles exit signals priorly, assuming exit signals are pointing to more critical low-level issues.

**Note2:** This is likely a Node.js bug.

**Test plan**

It allows us to factor the logic, and I think it also solves a pair of issues where relative subdependencies were not correctly resolved when installed from non-`link:` and non-`file:` dependencies (this is only my belief based on my lecture of the source code, I haven't yet took the time to validate this hypothesis).

**Summary**
Fix for https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/3920.

In this [commit](https://github.com/wtgtybhertgeghgtwtg/yarn/commit/f4fe7431ed992862a1c1d2357e6521c268bad7a7), `userHome` for linux users running as root was changed to `/usr/local/share`, mainly to allow for other users to run globally added bins. However this introduced a bug where npmrc wasn't being looked in the root directory after checking `/user/local/share`. So this change pushes another location to check in case `userHome` is different from native home directory returned by `os.homedir()`

I've added a test to generally test the `getPossibleConfigLocations` method, but I haven't been able to properly mock out running it as a root user on linux. Suggestions welcome!"

**Summary**
Fixes: #3907.

In yarn version 0.27.4 a patch (https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/commit/5ff69228f6cc9fa27bbaeb67412f7f66f218b9da) introduced a change that caused an authorization header to be added to requests that were not being sent to the registry.

This commit brings back some older logic to ensure we only add the authorization header when we are sending requests to the registry.

**Test plan**

Many new unit tests for requests and `isRequestToRegistry`.

To test this change you need a private repository using a repository server such, as Verdaccio configured, to only allow authenticated calls to be made for both download and publish commands. This configuration requires that yarn has the `always-auth` option enabled.

If we install additional packages from GitHub and save them to the `yarn.lock` file it should not send the authorization header for these requests."

I refactored `parseRefs` to return the full ref name, so we can differentiate branches and tags.

I use `git ls-remote --symref` to get the default branch name. This works only in recent versions of git (thanks Travis CI for reporting the issue), so I fall back to another algorithm if `--symref` is unavailable.

Refs #3524.

macOS tests on Travis CI keep timing out and they run very slowly. This patch attempts to solve this by doing the following:

- Use ramfs for `__tests__` folder and for `$TMPDIR` for faster file system
- Remove unnecessary `brew update` and `brew install yarn` commands
- Remove unnecessary `--max-workers` argument since all CI VMs have only 2 cores
- Clean up tmp folders per test after they are done
- Fix `link/unlink` test's race condition and previous test case reliance
- Fix `request-manager` timeout tests to be more reliable and finish in under our normal timeout
- Use real timers by default and add necessary `useFakeTimers` calls
- Increase heap size for Linux and OS X to 4 GB since OS X builds were crashing due to limited heap space
- Removes retries from Travis CI

With #3633 we started overriding the default `env` map that was passed

a whitelist, now it is only the ones we wanted to add, instead of
`process.env` + the additions. This patch fixes the problem by spreading
`process.env` before the new values.

**Summary**

Potentially fixes #3011 (specifically https://git.io/vHAzW).

Turns out our `ConcatStream` implementation was only used to read
from `tar-fs` when creating a package to upload and put that stream
into a memory buffer. Since `ConcatStream` was implemented as a
`stream.Transform` and nothing was reading back from it, it had the
potential to just hang there until something reads from it. This
patch replaces that with [a small script][1].

**Summary**

Fixes #764.

Turns out when fetching packages from remote sources via Git,
it may ask for a username or password and get stuck there since
we run it in the background. This patch passes the following env
variables to disable any prompts:

1. `$GIT_ASKPASS=""""`
   This is the command Git runs to get username and pass. Setting
   it to an empty string disables it and git exits with an error.
2. `$GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`
    This is new in Git 2.3 and it prevents git from even trying to
    ask for a password. Surpasses `$GIT_ASKPASS` above.
3. `$GIT_SSH_COMMAND=""ssh -oBatchMode=yes""`
    This is also new in Git 2.3 and it makes git make the call to
    ssh via this command. `BatchMode=yes` option tells ssh to not
    do anything interactive (because batch/script mode) like
    password prompts in case publickey auth fails etc.

**Test plan**

Do `yarn add git+https://github.com/Napsty/privrepo.git#1.0.2`. `yarn`
hangs before this patch and fails with a ""Refusing to download"" error
after the patch."

* Enhancement: slightly optimize how we update status from running scripts

** Summary **

This patch does two minor optimizations:

1. Do not even have a handler for data updates if we don't have a
   spinner. This avoids noop calls to a handler that just returns
   if we don't have a spinner.
2. Optimize getting the last available line from the buffer.
   Instead of using `.split()` and `.pop()` it uses `.lastIndexOf()`
   and `.substr()` to locate and extract the last line.

* fs: do bulk file reads to optimize cache extraction

This patch boosts cache extraction by ~2x+ by letting node
do more parallelization work. This makes nearly all of the file copy
stuff be done by the C++ code with minimal boundary-crossing (at least
compared to node streams).

Streams in node.js are ~3x slower, specially for small files,
than just doing fs.writeFile/readFile, because of this boundary. This
is something Yarn might want to take into account in other places.

The reason this is OK is because pretty much any files this would
handle would fit neatly into memory (any npm packages MUST fit
into memory by definition, because of the way npm@<5 does extracts).

If you really want to make doubleplus sure to minimize memory usage,
you could do an fs.stat to find the file size and then do heuristics
to only use streams for files bigger than <X>MB.

The previous behaviour had a default of enabling emojis for Macs, and
allowed explicitly disabling them.

This PR keeps that default but allows `--emoji` to enable for other
platforms if the user wants to.  `--no-emoji` still works as before, but
due to the way that commander processes ""--no-"" flags (forcing the
default to true and overwriting the default value given in the `.option`
definition) it was necessary to switch the flag definition from
`--no-emoji` to `--emoji`."

* Allow prerelease versions when checking peer deps

Uses lower-level APIs in node-semver to allow prerelease versions when checking peer deps. This honors the intent of library authors e.g. when they write a React component that asks for `""react"": "">=15.0.0""` they're saying OK with `react@16.0.0` (partly because the React team specifically has said that if you don't have any warnings in version N, then version N+1 should work for you). By extension and modulo bugs, `react@16.0.0-alpha` works too (if the user explicitly installs it).

Test Plan: Added unit tests for the new semver utility.

Tested in a real project that uses React 16.0.0-alpha.11 and verified I didn't get any peer dep warnings that usually appear from libraries that ask for `""react"": "">=15.0.0""`. Downgraded React to 0.14.0 (too low) and saw peer dep warnings come back as expected.

* Tighten up upper bounds so that ""2.0.0-pre"" doesn't match ""^1.0.0""

node-semver converts ~ and ^ ranges into pairs of >= and < ranges but the upper bounds don't properly exclude prerelease versions. For example, ""^1.0.0"" is converted to "">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"", which includes ""2.0.0-pre"" since prerelease versions are lower than their non-prerelease counterparts. As a practical workaround we make upper-bound ranges exclude prereleases and convert ""<2.0.0"" to ""<2.0.0-0"", for example.

Added unit tests as well."

* When testing `yarn pack`, use fs.walk instead of fs.readdir

This ensures that files inside directories are listed too.

* Add failing test for packing directories recursively

https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2498

* `pack`: include contents of directories in `files` field

This makes it so that you don't have to put '/**' after a directory in
the `files` field of package.json to ensure that the contents of the
directory will be published.

* `path` test: Make output easier to understand

just getting a -1 vs 0 from an indexOf test.

* `pack`: transform each [ ""file-name"" ] into [ ""file-name"", ""file-name/**"" ], whether it's a file or a folder

This is a mitigation for issue #2629.
In some cases two different packages could end up unpacking into the same cache folder.
Example https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2629#issuecomment-282745896, package typescript is downloaded twice because yarn.lock has inconsistent entries.
This change prevents more than one package to be unpacked into the same cache folder.

This is not a final fix for #2629, there is a more specific bug in resolver that causes this internal inconsistency but I think fetcher should check that every package will be extracted in a unique folder anyway.

Test Plan:
- I'll add a unit test in the next PR when I'll be fixing the reason for the same package having 2 downloads
- Manual test plan

Instead of including all the raw JS files in the dist tarball, just use the single Yarn JS file that's built as part of the build, along with a few other files that are required. This significantly reduces the number of files in the tarball:

```
C:\src\yarn\dist (bundle-as-dist) (yarn@0.23.0-0)
Œª find .
.
./bin
./bin/node-gyp-bin
./bin/node-gyp-bin/node-gyp
./bin/node-gyp-bin/node-gyp.cmd
./bin/yarn
./bin/yarn.cmd
./bin/yarn.js
./bin/yarnpkg
./bin/yarnpkg.cmd
./lib
./lib/v8-compile-cache.js
./lib/yarn-cli.js
./LICENSE
./package.json
```

There are three .js files in the archive:
 - `lib/v8-compile-cache.js`:  Speeds up instantiation time by using the V8 code cache (https://www.npmjs.com/package/v8-compile-cache). This needs to be separate as it has to load **before** the bulk of the application code is loaded, so it can **not** be bundled
 - `lib/yarn-cli.js`: Contains all the bundled Yarn code
 - `bin/yarn.js`: Entry point to the app, just like today. Loads `v8-compile-cache` then loads `yarn-cli`

This change means that **only** the JavaScript files that are actually used are included, resulting in a nice file size reduction for the installation packages:
![](http://ss.dan.cx/2017/04/Yarn_bundle_dist_metrics_-_Google_Sheets_-_Google__01-13.51.49.png)

Differences are due to differing compression algorithms: Debian packages use xz or LZMA, RedHat uses gzip, Windows installer uses Cabinet

They're also slightly faster to extract:
![image 3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/91933/24582332/483b41f4-16e2-11e7-9509-8024b1e78a39.png)

Testing was performed on my desktop computer (Intel Core i5 6500, Samsung 850 Evo 1TB SSD, Windows 10), with testing for Linux stuff (like installing the Debian package) tested in a Docker container.

Raw data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d8jdf3DU_GUFdotlPl08PkYa8SkzStK2tgnQ54ivsm0/edit?usp=sharing

Performance is very slightly faster when using `v8-compile-cache` along with the bundled file, but it's not extremely significant (`yarn --version` went from 0.19s to 0.14s on my BuyVM server). The difference might be bigger on servers with slower disks (HDD) or with more overloaded servers.

I also deleted the `build-dist.ps1` file because we _should_ be able to assume that Bash is available on Windows, particularly if Git is installed (as it comes with Git Bash). I need to verify that this works on AppVeyor."

This PR opens the way to share configuration between multiple projects via the use of the .yarnrc
files. The current design it pretty simple: it simply adds the supported options from the yarnrc file at the beginning of the command line.

Some notes:

The yarnrc is currently parsed synchronously. I believe this is not an issue, since it's quite literally the very first thing we need to do when booting the application (even before the command line can be parsed), so there's really nothing we could run concurrently anyway.

The yarnrc is read in another file (https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/registries/yarn-registry.js). I haven't changed how it works there, since I wanted my first draft to have as few changes as possible, but it's something that should probably be fixed so that the code only use one path to manage the yarnrc files."

Summary

Fixes #2514

Integrity check does not need resolver to be initialized and install hydrated.
It needs to read yarn.lock and pass patterns and entries to integrity checker.

This change reduces execution time of check --integrity from 2 seconds to 0.2 seconds.

Also I added a few more tests to integrity checking logic and moved some lockfile and integrity related tests into a separate test file"

Summary

This PR expands internal implementation of integrity check functionality.

.yarn-integrity file now contains all the properties as exploded JSON instead of sha-1 hashed.
This makes it easier to debug issues with integrity checks and installations

.yarn-integrity now contains list of files in node_modules if install/add command has --check-files flag passed.
When check command is executing it will have an option to test that files exist on disk.
This makes the command useful to identify when node_modules gets partially removed.

To use the new file checking feature:

yarn install --check-files
yarn check --integrity --check-files
This is an opt-in feature so people should not be affected buy it yet.
In the next iteration we may consider making --check-files the default option.
Also we may want to reevaluate other flags in check command and end up with more semantic/self explanatory options.

Exploded .yarn-integrity and especially files field allows us to integrate with third-party tools that may need list of files before yarn install is executed (e.g. BUCK).
Also it allows us to make a quick integrity check without loading much of the Yarn internals - only check that lock files entries are present, flags are the same and folders exist."

* Fix `yarn version` which yields same output as `yarn --version` (#2491)

There was a conflict when commander attempts to parse the incoming args
between the command executed and the options since the name `version`
was shared. In other words, executing the command `yarn version`
would yield the same output as `yarn --version`. This relates to PR #2268.

* Shift first arg that shares name with an option to circumvent conflicting name bug

Relating to tj/commander.js#346, when an arg shares the same name as an
option, it wrongly ignores the arg command and executes the option
instead. Therefore, executing 'yarn version' would instead translate
to 'yarn --version'. This logic can subsequently be removed once this issue is resolved."

Currently, when you have interconnected file dependencies, yarn install
fails after a lockfile has been generated. This failure occurs because
we call split on the package's resolved url, which is undefined. This fix
makes sure we have a resolved url before trying to call split on it.

For example, you have a project that has only two dependencies, a and b.
Both are local files. Package a depends on b, and b has no dependencies.
You can run yarn install from a clean state without issue. This generates
a lock file. Running yarn install a second time fails. This issue fixes
that.

This makes yarn link work when $HOME/.config/yarn/link/ is itself a symlink.

----

The following commit forces symlinks to be relative:
https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/commit/36d73cc3bb0e3c4afcea4f25b06cc76b7b5531fa

This isn't ideal, although it enables some portability it breaks others.
For example, it is not uncommon for `$HOME/.config` itself to be be a
symlink: `$HOME/.config` -> `$HOME/src/stefanpenner/dotfiles`.

Now when running `yarn link` inside `$HOME/src/ember-cli/ember-cli` we
end up with:

```js
path.relative('/Users/spenner/.config/yarn/link/ember-cli',
'/Users/spenner/src/ember-cli/ember-cli');
=> '../../../src/ember-cli/ember-cli'
```

Which results in the link located at:
`/Users/spenner/.config/yarn/link/ember-cli` pointing to
`/Users/spenner/.config/src/ember-cli/ember-cli` rather then
`/Users/spenner/src/ember-cli/ember-cli`

This is because `/Users/spenner/.config` is actually a symlink pointing
to `/Users/spenner/src/stefanpenner/dotfiles/.config/`

---

This PR provides mitigate the issue raised in #2096, but reifying the
paths via `realpathSync` before deriving the relative path. This doesn't
fix all issues, e.g. symlinks cannot be changed after this reification."

* Fix request authentication for scoped private registry tarballs

Yarn correctly sends authorization headers when resolving metadata, but
when it's time to download the tarballs, it calls registry.request
with a full tarball url. This causes the getRegistry() function to
incorrectly return the DEFAULT_REGISTRY url which means the authorization
headers are no longer sent. The response in this case is a JSON error
object instead of a tarball file. Untaring fails with ""invalid tar file""

* Don't assume anything about the registry URL, read registries from config

* Add a test for installing private packages requiring authentication

* Change the authed package testing strategy to be more local

* Include non scoped registries in available registries list

* Unnest the authed pkg test, use FlowFixMe for afterEach"

This resolves a bug in which yarn was saving scoped packages in the offline mirror by their base name, which meant that if two packages in a project had the same name and version, but one of them was scoped and the other was not, only one of these would be saved in the offline mirror, and this would potentially cause a ""bad hash"" error to occur.

This commit fixes this behavior, and saves scoped npm packages in the offline mirror in the form `@[scope]-[package name]-[version].tar.gz`."

* Change DEB nodejs relation from Depends to Recommends

A ""Recommends"" relation preserves the out-of-the-box experience for most people,
as recommended packages are installed by default on modern Debian / Ubuntu
distros. But it allows people who install Node.js in a different manner to opt
out of the nodejs DEB package.

I think it's bad idea to exit 1 in this case - because this script can't be used in pipeline or in ansible. Throwing exception breaks next movements. If Yarn already installed this script - it will warn and normally exited with exit code 0.

* Handle installation for 'fish' shell

'fish' is a popular shell. This commit adds support for proper detection and installation of yarn in 'fish' shell. If the detected shell is 'fish', add path to ~/.yarn/bin in $HOME/.config/fish/config.fish file.

* Use a more modern way of setting $PATH in fish

Set `~/.yarn/bin` in `$fish_user_paths` instead of setting it in `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file.

See [suggestion from fish documentation](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/527#issuecomment-13811988) for more reference.

* Run command to set $fish_user_paths instead of evaluating a string."

* Use built-in `stream.Transform` to create `HashStream`s

Since we're only targeting newer Node versions with a reasonable stream module, and we can use the `class` syntax sugar, it makes sense to extend `stream.Transform` directly to create a `HashStream`. In a future commit, this will allows to remove `through2` altogether.

Also, `HashStream` was previously mistyped as a `stream$Readable`, when in fact, it's a `stream$Transform`.

* Fix `cachedStream` type

`validateStream` (`cachedStream` is piped into it a few lines below) was mistyped as a `stream$Readable` instead of a `stream$Transform`. It's now correctly typed, so this isn't necessary.

Instead of doing weird nested stream passing, there's now an `Unpack` stream constructor that can unzip a stream if the input is gziped, or passthrough the data otherwise.

* Unnest tarball saving streams

* Use `stream.PassThrough` for logging instead of `through2`

* Remove `through2` dependency"
